POSITIVE,Very well located. Small but nice room. Staff is very friendly.
POSITIVE,Good for the price (except in season). I stay here approx once a month.
POSITIVE,The location is great. Nice place for the money and my husband and I are very picky people. The lobby is beautiful.
POSITIVE,ONLY PROBLEM WAS BED WAS A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR MY TASTE.. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS GREAT..
POSITIVE,The staff were friendly and helpful. My daughter loved the numerous pillows. Hotel is located 1/2 a block from downtown and a few blocks from the park. The park has a gorgeous river running through it... swings etc. lovely.
POSITIVE,My hubby and I stayed at the excalibur for one night and that stay was pleasant. Not only was it cheap and directly on the strip but its walking distance to some of the hottest clubs and restaurants. We're given an upgrade free of charge. The room was clean. And checking out took less than a minute.
POSITIVE,Great value for the price. Clean well maintained older property. Need new TV's though! Staff always very friendly.
POSITIVE,location Close to Old Town. Staff was excellent and room was fine. Location is best thing about it being close to Old Town.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here on our honeymoon, was slightly out of town but we had a car so it was a short drive into town. Hotel was clean, good breakfast, would stay here again, great for a few night stay"
POSITIVE,My friends and I had a blast. We enjoyed our room. Will recommd to others!
NEGATIVE,"This is the noisiest place I have ever stayed, you could hear the people upstairs thumping around, I called to complain and they did nothing, you could also hear the noise off the Strip. Didnt sleep well!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel have a welcome drinking from 4:30- 5:30pm, guest feel very warm. No free parking"
POSITIVE,"Staff was extremely friendly,helpful"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I were very satisfied with this hotel, particularly considering the rate charged. We would stay there again without hesitation."
POSITIVE,very good will be back for next year stay very good restarunt
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was ok, but people were sleeping and yelling in the hall until 6-7am, and you could here everything going on outside I'm used to a bit more sound proofing I guess. Really wish they had a coffee pot in the room."
NEUTRAL,Really need to upgrade your rooms. Very plain rooms.
POSITIVE,"Perfect location, clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful."
NEUTRAL,"We had a 6th floor room--I did request an upper floor for the view. View was half of the Holiday Inn next door and partial of the harbor and bay. It was rather noisy from street traffic and the airport just down the road (although very convenient to the airport). We like to stay near the airport when we have early morning departures so we had to excuse the jet noise. The coffeemaker was single cup and not good for a couple of people..so we had to split the first cup...and morning java is important to us while dressing. The WIFI which is advertised free is non-existant on the 6th floor and is a weak WIFI system overall. They do have a computer in the lobby and we had to go downstairs to use our laptop. Balcony had no chairs. BRIGHT lights on either side so that you had no privacy. We had room darkening drapes but the bright light came around the edges making the room quite light at night. The breakfast is typical economy hotel --no juice, coffee, cereals, waffles, better quality pastries, yogurt, bananas and apples. Negative was the small windowless, no atmosphere breakfast room. They really should do something about that. Room price was about $80 + tax. We had 2 queens but the room was smaller so not a lot of extra space. Also, room amenities were a fridge and microwave. Parking was free and there seemed to be plenty of it. I would not stay there again because there are so many other choices of equal value. The hotel is just a couple of miles away from the Maritime Museum and the Midway. It is also not far from the Old Town San Diego area which we enjoyed very much, especially the FREE very well done Mormon Battalion historical exhibit which was extremely informative and interesting. Room Tip: Check your WIFI if that is important before choosing an upper story room. Also highway noise"
NEUTRAL,Nice digs noise It's on the back side of the Quater. Hotel is nice. But... You can hear everthing thru the walls. Staff was OK for NOLA. Long walk to everthing.
POSITIVE,"Very cooperative staff to making a change to stay an extra day. A little pricey but for the ammenities, very nice. They worked with us to find an available room. I would stay again."
POSITIVE,"Convenient clean and comfortable hotel at Newark airport. You can visit New York via New Jersey Transit, $25 return, 1/2 hr to central New York Penn Station."
POSITIVE,The hotel room was quite big and we liked the little kitchen.Everything was clean and we felt at home. The fridge turned out a bit loud at nights and the breakfast room was too crowded to feel comfortable.
POSITIVE,Very nice computer work station in the room. Room was spotless and very nice.
NEUTRAL,"The address is worthless.. Be prepared to call and ask how to get there, even with GPS. Oh, and drive a SMALL car - the parking lot is cramped and the entry at the back is narrow enough to prevent passing another vehicle. Room itself was verygood, spacious, clean and comfy. They need to upgrade to HDTVs - the old analogs are dated - cable or not. Not all of us have laptops and there was no phone book in the room to provide basic info on what's near re: dining etc.. It's VERY close to the airport but I heard no planes - and it's far enough from downtown (12+ miles) so as to avoid the main attraction crowds and noise. The staff at the desk were excellent and very personable. Overall - I'd go again.."
POSITIVE,"This is a fantastic hotel. The only slight disappointment was the lack of hot tub, but the indoor pool is kept very warm. Pros: The room was amazing! Very clean with comfortable beds. Cons: Disappointed that there was no hot tub.The indoor pool was a bit small and only 5 feet deep."
NEGATIVE,"AC unit in room sounded like a jet engine failing then trying to restart then failing then trying to restart then failing etc. Additionally, the FREE breakfast was old boxed cereal and cheap juice and bread. I asked to speak to the manager to inform of my dis-satisfaction of the AC unit keeping me up all night. I was never able to speak to managementÂ nor was I comped anything. If you are trying to sleep off your hangover in napa better off setting up shop in a vineyard for the night!"
POSITIVE,"Great find if you want to go to Pittsburgh, and not rent a car. The staff was SO friendly, just as other reviews have mentioned. They offer everything you need, will shuttle you all over the place, and feed you breakfast and cocktails too! The hotel itself needs a bit of updating, but the rooms are very comfortable. We will now make this our stop of choice, when visiting Pittsburgh!! Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet eva cocktail reception shuttle bus"
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel, well maintained, clean, spacious comfortable room. My only disappointment was that our room was directly across from their banquet room which was in use when we arrived that night, but housekeeping decided that they needed to clean that room early the next morning, and decided to prop that room's door open with their cleaning cart while they vacuumed. So my hopes to sleep in that morning were not to be as they began vacuuming before 7 am!!! Other than that the room was great and I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I stayed with my wife and two boys. Rooms are small, but well appointed and comfortable. Staff were very helpful."
POSITIVE,Just short trip to the shops and places to eat. Clean rooms nice pool area. Room Tip: The King suite is the best.
NEUTRAL,"Pros: Staff was helpful. Cons: Had to change rooms because of AC problems, and breakfast was subpar."
NEGATIVE,"I think most sites are rating this hotel at a 3 1/2 star... Id gravely disagree. Its basically an updated Motel 6 at best. The bathrooms have Motel6 counters / flooring / wall tile. The room was very basic and is definitely not nicer than some of the 21/2 star places I have stayed. If you have a choice between here and Springhill Suites or another comparable location, stay elsewhere!!"
POSITIVE,"Modern design hotel with nice, clean and comfort room, internet and small nice restaurant .you can wake up and go-walking distance and public transportation near by- and visit the beautiful city. Room Tip: all the same"
POSITIVE,"I was skeptical since the BW got such high reviews but was $30 cheaper than the Springfield Inn up the road. But everything was new, clean and shiny and the hotel staff courteous and helpful. The pool was clean and nice and a family reunion even rented the convention center while we were there."
POSITIVE,The staff was very helpful and courteous. I wasn't crazy about the restaurant. I would have liked to see a nice restaurant/bar in the hotel. The elevator was tiny...we had a wheelchair and it barely fit inside.
POSITIVE,excellent location and excellent service.
POSITIVE,"Friendly helpful staff, proximity to airport. We stayed at a $300+ hotel in ct and were treated far ruder than at the Best Western."
POSITIVE,"Free parking, free internet, good location Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is not exactly in an ideal location, however once you walk into the front doors, the decor and style boasts high quality hotel. The rooms are very clean, however quite small. The room and bathroom have very little walking space. (It reminds me of a extra small efficiency, to which the hotel put multiple mirrors in the room to give the look [?] of a bigger room. ) You do not notice the size of the rooms based on the photos. But if you are looking for a nice, clean room for the night, this is your hotel. I wouldn't choose any other in the area."
POSITIVE,"I love the welcoming of the staff, they made you feel comfortable as well as welcomed. From the reception area to your room was a class treatment. I loved your rooms they were very clean, and invitiong. We also loved!!!!! The shower. Your staff is to be complimented for the outstanding customer service they offer. I will be back> I loved the experience! There was nothing I didn't like at best western"
POSITIVE,"Stayed here on NYE 2011 and priced to sell! Only 30 minutes to NYC, with public transportation right behind the hotel. The staff members were excellent and extremely helpful. While far from a luxury hotel, it has the basic essentials, and it's pet friendly. My only complaint is that the microwave did not work. This was especially a let down after I [?] had my heart set on a late night meal after the NYE festivities. In any event, if going to bed without a second dinner was the only complaint, I'd have to say I recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to save money, doesn't mind a short drive to the city and simply wants a place to rest their head after a day/evening of activities."
NEGATIVE,This was our family last summer get away before they returned to school. Wtih four girls ages 5 to 15 we reserved two rooms the rooms were dirty the bathroom shower had mold and the AC units was full of mold and leaked. The room was not cleaned on our first day two towels were in the girls room the trash was not taken out a trash bag was left on the floor next to the can. I called to ask about the towels head of housekeeping came she gave us the towels but was very defensive when we asked why the rooms had not been cleaned. We also spoke to the front desk about the mold she was very nice explaing the hotel is going through a deep cleaning and these were the rooms they had not been cleaned . However we enjoyed Saint Augustine its a beautiful city with a deep history.
POSITIVE,"What a great place to stay! The room was extremely clean and the fireplace so cozy on a wintery, snowy night. The staff in the lounge were fun and we had a few laughs over some good food. So much food we had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Pool and hot tub again very clean with a fast fun waterslide. The breakfast buffet had a nice selection with loads of hot or cold choices. All in all a very pleasant place to stay. We will stay again and recommend it to others. The location is good for getting to the airport. The thermostate is a little trickly to use but figured it out."
POSITIVE,"This hotel met every expectation and then some. I was a bit leary of it before w arrived because we got such a good price on the room...you usually get what you pay for and $49 plus tax was way too good to be true...or so I thought. We could not have asked for a better experience. The room was spotless, the beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly. We will be going back!"
POSITIVE,"Excellent spot to spend a night before/after flight. VERY convenient, quiet (for us anyway, no flight noise), handy restaurant outside, excellent staff and newly refurbished large spacious rooms."
POSITIVE,"Our family of four had an overall good stay. The bed was comfortable and I liked the fact we had two pillows, each. The breakfast bar was really good and well stocked to the end as we came close to 9 am both mornings. A couple small complaints,the pool was clean, but super cold so no one could swim. If they are going to open it in March they could invest [?] in a pool warmer for the future. :) My girls really looked forward to swimming. Also we think there should be pool towels avaliable so you are not using your same room towels for pool and shower. back to positive, the staff and waiters were very friendly and the lounge was very nice too. We would stay again."
POSITIVE,The restraunt on site was delicious and we met the chef.. Great! The room was clean and comfortable. Great place to say and great price!
POSITIVE,Does not allow for vehicle parking when taking trip.
POSITIVE,Exeptionally friendly staff. Always ready to help you with any issues that may arise. Would recommend them to anyone.
POSITIVE,Reasonable price for a reasonable hotel. Including outdoor swimming pool and indoor parking which was appreciated considering the area the hotel is located in. Breakfast capacity was not sufficient for number of guests. Room was VERY noisy due to carboard ceiling and upper neighbour running around all night and waking us up all the time by doing so......This was also a complaint from other guests on our floor (2nd of 3).
POSITIVE,"We researched this hotel well before our holiday as our daughter was joining us from New Zealand. It didn't let us down and from start to finish we were made to feel welcome. Everything from the food in the main dining area and also the bar, through to the facilities. The staff were excellent and very professional. We have booked many times with others such as Premier and Travel Lodge but this was our first with Best Western and it didn't let us down. Will certainly be returning in the future."
POSITIVE,The staff couldn't of made us more welcoming. They were all very polite and helpfull. Even kept their cool when the fire alarm went of in the morning. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"Staff very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Food in restaurant superb, decor lovely. Really close to beach and town. Good size pool and lovely new steam room, spa pool and sauna. We will be returning again soon."
POSITIVE,Very close to town and even closer to the beach. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would definately recommend hot stone massage! The wait for food at lunch times was longer than expected for what we ordered. Air conditioning in the rooms would be a plus as it was very stuffy even after our weekend heatwave. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,Excellent breakfast ..comfortable beds ..clean ..my balcony view .. Inside hotel much too hot ..no Air con .. rooms overheat ..duvets for winter ..in summer !
POSITIVE,Very friendly staff who looked after us from check-in to check-out Small room but I knew this when booking
POSITIVE,The only concern was that some noise could be heard from the other rooms.
POSITIVE,Friendly front desk and bar
NEUTRAL,Location and ease of parking. Breakfast was rather basic and breakfast room was small. Our room had door to ajoining room and was not very sound proof. I.E. could easily hear neighbours.
NEGATIVE,Shuttle service to metro Noise between rooms Very loud air conditioning Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,Good value. Looked at other hotels on internet that were priced lower but after looking at pictures and guest reviews decided it was better to pay a bit more for a better hotel. The manager was very pleasant and interested that the guests were having a good stay. Already recommended hotel to others. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
NEUTRAL,Reasonable price and good location for airport Very dated and run-down
NEUTRAL,The shuttle service was very convenient. The linens felt were clean but didn't feel too comfortable. Like they were coated with chlorine or something.
POSITIVE,This is a quality bargain at a good price. Excellent continental breakfast and the past place I have stayed for being pet friendly.
POSITIVE,Cheap and not far from the airport.
POSITIVE,"We had a happy to stay at this hotel. I'd read reviews about noise at the front rooms, and so requested a rear room. The desk clerk situated us at the back for quiet, and it was just fine. The wall insulation was pretty good, so we were not disturbed. The room was all over clean and fresh smelling. The beds were VERY comfortable. We appreciated the amenties too, especially the dry sauna, and the laundry. Internet access was fine. The desk clerk was knowledgable about the Redwoods too, and advised us regarding the best locations. Complimentary breakfast was OK at the adjoining restaurant, though not great. Compared to the other hotels, the little extra we paid was well worth it."
POSITIVE,"Excellent modern clean building, good in-room facilities (E.G. coffee maker, iron, free wifi), friendly helpful staff, continental breakfast included in room rate, proximity to subway station (a line with direct express access both to Manhattan and jfk Airport). All for a reasonable price by New York standards. The main drawback is the location in a scruffy area of Brooklyn close to a main highway. However, access to subway is good (see above) and we didn't notice any traffic noise."
POSITIVE,Perfect for our budget minded overnight stay before catching our early morning flight.
POSITIVE,"I was hesitant to book this motel after reading some of the reviews posted on TripAdvisor, but I'm glad I went ahead with my booking. The motel is conveniently located to JFK - just a 10 min drive - and even though the location isn't the greatest (next to car parks, next to the sanitation department station, other airport hotels), it's great for getting to and from JFK for an overnight stay. Check-in took a while, even though I had called ahead the day before to confirm my booking (as I had booked through a third party website) and request a non-smoking room. At first, the clerk told me I didn't have a reservation, and she couldn't find my booking in the system - I panicked, because when I had called the day before, the clerk I spoke to then had no trouble locating my reservation.. The clerk finally found my reservation after I showed her the confirmation email I had received. Apparently if you book through a third party website, any ""pre-paid"" reservations are located in a different system on their computer.. I was able to check-in early at 11am, even though the standardcheck-in time is 3pm. I got a non-smoking room on the second floor, and was pleasantly surprised when I entered the room as there was a king bed in the room, and I had only booked a queen bed online. The room was on the small side (especially with a king bed), but it had a TV unit, a reading chair + ottoman, a desk and chair, and a wardrobe. The motel also supplied a coffee maker in the room with coffee, tea , creamer and sugar sachets. No fridge! The room was nice and clean, the bed was super comfy, and the pillows and linens were really nice and luxurious. I had a view of the motel car park. The bathroom was also a tad small, but it worked. The towels and toiletries provided were great. There was also a hairdryer in the bathroom. The breakfast was ok. They had bread, cereal, waffles, scrambled eggs, turkey patties, bagels, doughnuts, muffins, fruit, tea, coffee and juice on offer. Nothing spectacular, but it did the trick. The seating though was a bit limited, but when I had breakfast at 6.30am, there weren't too many people. On the downside: >The motel is located in the middle of no where, and there are no gas stations or convenience stores nearby. >The lift in the building was really slow. >I could hear the faucets running in the room next door everytime they were used by the occupant - it sounded like it was coming from my bathroom! >The wifi was a bit iffy, and would drop out every time I tried to click on links to go to new pages (eg., I would go to my email homepage and type in my login details, then when I would hit login, the internet would drop out and go to the ""Internet Explorer cannot find the page you're looking for"" screen) - and this would happen with EVERY transmit. >The housekeeping staff were still cleaning and vacuuming at 5pm in the evening which I found bizarre. And then I was woken up at 5.45am by more vacuuming in the hallway! >Also, my room was located right next to the breakfast area, so it was a bit noisy when breakfast service started at 6am. Even though the room rate was quite high (I think due to NY Fashion Week being on), I would recommend this motel! Room Tip: Call ahead the day before to secure a non-smoking room if you are a non-smoker, and don't want a smoky-smelling room! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"No much too say - we stayed for one night - airline transfer. The room was clean, nice and had all the facilities (including iron and ironing board). There is one problem. Actually a very big problem... The breakfast. It was the worst one I had in my life."
POSITIVE,"It was close to jfk airport Web site says 10 minutes from jfk. By the time you take the airtrain, then shuttle, it was more like 1/2 hour. The trip back in the morning was much quicker."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is at the northern entrance to Yellowstone. It is located right on the Yellowstone river, which was running at 3x normal volume. The rooms overlooking the river are great. We opted for the two bedroom suite, which was more like a condo. It allowed separate sleeping areas for two young adults and parents along with 3 TVs and 2 bathrooms. There was a good sized living room, a dinette area, and a kitchen. We saved enough money on food that we could afford the extra space. Plenty of free parking and good access to the northern part of the Park. 5 minutes to the entrance and 10-15 to the visitor center near the hot springs."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is clearly an older property, but serves its purpose. The room was clean and sufficiently large. Beds were comfortable but covered with only a sheet and thin blanket, so I had to bring in my own blankets from the car. AC unit was also quite loud.Pros: It was cheap and it was clean; included free breakfast and free Internet. Cons: Older property with exterior entrances; had to call to request a non-smoking room."
NEUTRAL,Near to the roads to amusement park. Breakfast included and enough good. the look isn't to much new. one of the receptionist woman was unfriendly
POSITIVE,"For the price, this place certainly served us well. Spacious room with fridge and microwave. Courteous staff. Typical breakfast fare. Luxury it's not, but it certainly fit the bill."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was good. What is missing is a restaurant or a place to get something to drink. The staff gave me several carry-out menus, but neglected to tell us that we could use the breakfast room for a comfortable place to eat. It worked out and we found the tables, but the staff should suggest this to the guests."
POSITIVE,Shuttle service to Airport needs to start earlier 8am to late I would not stay here again because of that almost missed flight
POSITIVE,Guest Services - Not very good about explanation as to why we were getting a $100 discount on tickets to walt disney world- not a good explanation at all!!! We felt we got roped into something that we were totally not interested in until after the fact - wyndham resort vacations - a real pressure sales environment!!!
POSITIVE,Actually inside the gate of WDW just close to downtown disney ..
POSITIVE,"Be sure to get on the correct Best Western shuttle from DFW (there are two different hotels near the airport). This one was clean and comfortable, and staff was friendly."
POSITIVE,The curtains by the bedside needs to be sliding to close. Lights from the outside is pentrating the interior of the room therefore it's just like day time and hard to get some sleep.
NEUTRAL,"The rooms were comfortable, with micro, fridge,TV & good lighting. Staff was welcoming and responsive to a couple of problems. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
NEUTRAL,"Breakfast area much too small. Windowless room that is about 10 or 12 feet square with TV. When in season, it is impossible to enjoy breakfast due to the area being flooded with people. Pros: Price, good value Cons: Tiny cramped breakfast room; in-room safes are often locked by previous tenant and housekeeping staff does not insure that they are unlocked. Location: OK near middle of city but need car as most parts of Florida."
NEUTRAL,confortable beds breakfast buffet didn't have much choice Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
NEGATIVE,"The photos are deceiving, the place was so run down old and things didnt work. The price wasnt cheap for what we received. The only good things were the view from the balcony and that the hotel had free wifi The laundry dryer was coin operated and didnt work well. The rooms were very small and run down, bathroom so tiny and no fan in bathroom. The hotel needs some major renovations. The pool area is tiny and dated"
NEUTRAL,"I'd say all in all it was pretty clean rooms but the bathroom floor was another matter altogether. Lots of black hairs all over the place (no not curly ones). The views were great from the room overlooking the lake, If your into sport or ESPN it not available in your room you have to go to the lounge for Monday night football and there pretty proud of there drinks so bring some cash to the lounge."
POSITIVE,"Big rooms, good value. May come back with whole family next time."
NEGATIVE,The staff at the Hotel is and was very much not willing to assist.
POSITIVE,After an exhausting day moving house my wife and I struggled to find any local overnight accomodation apart from the Rockaway Hotel. We went there expecting the worst but we were pleasantly surprised to find a very comfortable and clean hotel. The reception area appeared dowdy but the room was more than adequate.
POSITIVE,"Short walk to Old Quebec and close to shops, restaurants and parks. For a family with three younger children the room was a good size and the kids loved the pool. Very pleased with our stay at this hotel. We were happy with our stay. I do recommend reading the information in the binder about the Hotel and how to work things in the room. If we had done this we would have located the temperature control panel for the air conditioner and avoided a rather chilly first night.

POSITIVE,Staff were very helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,Nice clean comfortable and quiet rooms. Good restaurant downstairs.
POSITIVE,"Clean room, good facilities; Staff courteous and helpful; Breakfast was very good and a wide variety of choices; In-room safe is useful and a ""must"" for valuables and cash."
POSITIVE,friendly and helpful staff - airport shuttle - rooms were spacious and facilities were first class - located next to interstate highways and the airport and down town Atlanta - and a very good value for money price. e-mails to the hotel seemed to be routed via a central office and were slow to respond.
POSITIVE,It was a nice clean place to stay.Good environment.
NEUTRAL,Location Noise
POSITIVE,"We stopped here enroute to Anna Maria Island, two families travelling together. We had a good nights sleep at a good price, with some very nice servicee from the receptionist."
POSITIVE,Great value and good overnight stop Very clean We had a room at the back so also quiet
POSITIVE,"The staff was great, very friendly and customer service oriented. The room was very \u201cuser friendly\u201d. The location was in an area that made my stay easy to navagate."
NEUTRAL,The bathroom was so small you could hardly towel off.
POSITIVE,Simple clean place to stay near the nightlife in downtown Vancouver.
NEGATIVE,"First, I'm baffled that other reviewers said for the money it was a great deal. Um, NO. My room was $190 for your basic tired room. Had I stayed at a Motel 6 and paid $80 for the night I would have no complaints, but for $200 it was terrible. 1. No laundry bag for me to separate my dirty linens from clean. This was a problem because I wasn't going home after this hotel. 2. The bathroom was very small. 3. The alarm clock was unplugged and whatever was wrong with the outlet prevented me from plugging it in. 4. The room in general was ""tired"" and worn out. 5. The other guests. I have a news flash for everybody. it is NOT ok to walk around the hotel in your pajamas. It's fine if your 10 year old is, but it's not pleasant to goto breakfast and have a third of the adults still in their pjs. 6. There are other far better hotels in the area around the same price that are MUCH better. I actually moved to another hotel and am writing this review from there. The price difference was $10 and the differences couldn't be more glaring. Again, it's about expectations. For $200 a night and where it's located, it was NOT a nice hotel. I expect more if they are going to charge those kinds of rates."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable bed, quiet surroundings."
NEGATIVE,"Well, the room was clean and neat. The shower was amazing, I will replace all the shower heads in my home with the type they had in the room. The bath towels and washcloths were big, soft and very absorbable. The staff was friendly, BUT, let me tell you this, the bed was the worst bed I have ever slept on in my entire life. I'm not kidding you, I felt as if I slept on a pile of rocks the whole two nights I was there. My entire body was sore when I woke up. That's not good if you have to sit in a meeting the whole day. I have two more meetings in Raleigh this month and next month. I WILL NOT STAY AT THE BEST WESTERN EVER AGAIN. If you can't get a good nights sleep in the bed your in, your whole day will be MISSERABLE. AS I SAID, I WILL NOT STAY THERE AGAIN."
POSITIVE,Excellent
POSITIVE,"I stayed only one evening, but I was pleased to have such a spacious room. I utilized both the iron (my silk dress was wrinkled from being packed) and the safe (I was going to a party for the evening). Since I stayed during December, I was pleased to find the heating system worked well and quickly, although the huge king size bed had more than enough covers to keep me warm as well ;) Plenty of towels (four bath, two hand, and two facecloths...for one person) were available along with all the standard amenities of lotions, shampoo, conditioner, and soaps. I was pleasantly surprised to find that nothing was ""cut"" from the room given the price I paid. In short...this Inn is a great value :) I was most appreciative to find my non-smoking room was located in the back of the inn away from the main highway. I enjoyed a quiet sleep once I returned from the party."
POSITIVE,Great location. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Good recommendations for restaurants and places to visit. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,"Nice staff, comfortable, overall great value! Vending machines needed to be stocked."
POSITIVE,"It was very comfortable, a lovely big room with everything provided. The free coffee in the foyer was welcome and free laundry was really useful after a weeks touring holiday!! The breakfast ham was rather dried up after being kept warm....."
POSITIVE,"Don't usually stay at Best Western hotels, but had no choice as all other options were overloaded due to a big college football game. Could not have been more pleased. Front desk worked immediately on an internet issue, the room was clean, bed comfortable, and shower great. Would go back again without hesitation."
POSITIVE,"It was clean and was located in a great spot, close to the beach, mall, and dining. It was also very cheap for a rather nice room."
NEUTRAL,"All in all everything was ok. If the price is ok with you, this a good place to stay."
POSITIVE,"The hotel and restaurant were terribly understaffed the day I was there. Compounding the problem, all the computers were down which slowed things down even further. However, the hotel itself was nice and the few staff members that were there triedtheir best to make our stay pleasant."
POSITIVE,"It was a step above adequate. Comfortable enough, clean enough, etc. A little rundown, but not too much. It's a good value."
POSITIVE,"Room was very clean and comfortable, it had everything you would need for a short break. The reception staff were very helpfull despite being very busy on the phone we were never kept waiting long. Very easy to get into town as its very near to a bus stop and taxis are not that expensive which is great as if you decide to go for a meal and drink whilst you are shopping. There is nothing to dislike about this hotel."
POSITIVE,It was clean and confortable and stylish
POSITIVE,"Clean freindly, good breakfast, good value for money Long wait for bar meal on evening"
NEUTRAL,"Location was perfect for our trip. We went wine tasting in Paso Robles so it was very close to our best western inn.the hotel was clean and comfortable The continental breakfast served yo plait yogurt that was spoiled. We had problems with the room key, unlocking the door. I informed the person at the front desk but he didn't seem to care."
NEUTRAL,"Good location to wineries. Starbucks next door. Shower is inconsistent. Runs hot and cold. Thin walls, we could hear the next door folks."
POSITIVE,"This is an excellant hotel for the price. I brought my wife to visit the Wild Horse Sanctuary. Hotel was very clean, they are pet friendly, staff was excellant, complimentary light breakfast and we really enjoyed the hot tub which closes to families at 10:00 PM and then is open 10:00 PM - Midnight for adults only. The location is also great because it is also fairly close to Mt Rushmore, Chief Crazy Horse Monument and Custer State Park which we also visited. Some people complain about the small variety of food for breakfast, but it's free and in this economy that's a plus. Can't complain if it's free, get real. All the staff (front desk, breakfast room and house keeping)were excellant and courteous. Our room was pre-paid through Travelocity and when we checked out they did not show it being prepaid. No problem, they did not charge my card and got it resolved with Travelocity the very next day. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and am considering returning to Hot Springs just to stay in their hotel again! Curtis"
POSITIVE,"All in all it was good.Pros: Friendly staff, washer and dryer on site and the have everything you need to wash your clothes. Cons: The carpet has some loose dirt and the shower wasn't clean that good."
POSITIVE,Price. Not a good feel Lack of extras and a little dingy
NEUTRAL,"The stay at the town and country was all but impressive. It was small, smelly and way over priced. Very disappointed because almost all of my stays at Best Western have been good at a reasonable price. On a scale of 1 to 10 it was about a 2. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,Location and price Heating and cooling was too loud
NEUTRAL,"Got a great deal from booking.com on this hotel. Was never up early enough to try the breakfast, so can't comment on that. Staff was great and very friendly. They called the shuttle that could take us downtown for $10, round trip, per person. It was a great alternative to getting a cab and paying a ton of money for it. Bathroom felt very updated and new. I wish the TVs were updated. There are still old tube TVs with only so- so pictures on them. The rooms also feel very dark, even with all of the lights on, but that was okay."
POSITIVE,"Close to hospitals and Rice University. Good value for the location. Apparently, the carpet was not vacuumed as there were toe nail clippings from a prior guest next to the bed which was an unfortunate sight to see. If not for that, the room was very comfortable and and well maintained."
NEUTRAL,"The photos did not lie, we found everything as expected but were sruprised about a lovely managers reception. That was just great The reception were not very eager to help out when we had questions about the area, but anyway, it worked out. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,The bed was super comfy The toilet wasn't working properly Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,"No surprises, just what we wanted"
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed our stay at the best western carowinds during the labor dy weekend. The staff and housekeeping were very thorough and seemed in good spirits as they worked. Jason from the front desk day shift turned us on to a great local eatery that was family owned called Luans. We already have said when we travel we would definitely stay here again. It [?] was very close to attractons , local eateries and the freeway"
POSITIVE,"The location was good, not far off interstate, but near Naperville. It is an older hotel, but with the advantage of bigger rooms, nice furniture, very clean and comfortable."
POSITIVE,"The location was very convenient for my conference, and the price was better than other hotels in the area. My room was nice. It was rather noisy. I could hear very clearly/loudly noise from other guests' rooms and in the hallway, sometimes in the middle of the night."
POSITIVE,I liked the breakfast and the location it was pretty Easy to get to the subway station to go to anywhere i needed
NEUTRAL,"very nice, reasonable price, breakfast included with price"
POSITIVE,"It was great to find a reasonably priced suite right on our route. We also were far enough from the highway to not hear that noise. Pros: Being able to watch TV without having to lay on the bed, also the mini kitchen. Location: We travel from Michigan to Florida and back and this is right on the way."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is in a great location. It is really no more than 5 minutes by car from the Bryce Canyon National Park sign, and less than 10 minutes to the entrance to the park. It is a big, sprawling hotel with multiple ""lodges"" that are separated by parking areas. It made it interesting to go to meals in the main lodge, due to it being quite cold and snowy in the winter time. We had to bundle up for the short walk to the main lodge, which is where pretty much everything happens. The food served at the restaurant was adequate. I wouldn't call it perfect, but it was portioned well enough for the pricing, considering it's the only place to get food without driving about 10 miles to the town of Tropic. The two queen beds in our room were not very comfortable. They tended to sink in the middle, so my fiance and I were constantly rolling into each other in the middle of the night. Upon checkout, the person who was doing the checkout was not aware of the correct method to handle a prepaid booking through the internet. The hotel ended up charging my credit card after I had already prepaid via the internet. Their accounting department was not helpful directly and required contact from the booking agent to get the issue resolved. Make sure you ask lots of questions at check-in and check-out and confirm that your stay has been prepaid. I would only recommend this hotel if you absolutely have to stay within a very close distance to the national park itself."
POSITIVE,"Very nice and comfortable room. Staff was very courteous. Had a very good restaurant within walking distance. Located just off I75, so very convenient."
POSITIVE,"This is definitely a place I can bring my family to. Very welcoming, clean, and provides great service. I had a very enjoyable stay."
NEGATIVE,"reserved this hotel ""blindly"" based on the photos available through the hotels.com website, mistake #1. booked for 2 nights (sat/sun). Saturday asked for early check in and was denied, mistake #3. Sunday was trying to sleep in and was woken bye a loud water sound outside of the door, checked out the noise was horrified to find the hotel was being pressure [?] washed. Also sunday had no maid service so we had to make beds and use wet towels. I am all about being green and using a towel more than once, BUT NOT SURE ABOUT USING IT MORE THAN TWICE."
POSITIVE,"I needed a stop-over on my trip to and from Atlanta to Washington, DC, and picked this hotel, based on the price point and good reviews from other recent guests. I found it to be in a convenient area , easy to reach from the expressway, with a lot of dining options close by. I had no problem with the check-in or room, and felt like it was a good value. [?] The hotel has it's own restaurant, and I decided to try it on my second visit. I had a very nice flounder dinner and banana desert that met an actually exceeded my expectations. Will remember and stay there again when in the area."
POSITIVE,Rooms clean and comfortable. Excellent value for price. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
NEUTRAL,"I wish my reservationist had told me this hotel allows pets when I was deciding on a hotel. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Myron, at the front desk, about the ""review"" and I would get 10% off my bill if I participated. Also, why is my bill addressed to Stone, George? My name is Georgie, not George. and I live in Richlands, NC, not Bellevue, WA. What's that all about? Room Tip: Ask if pets are allowed."
POSITIVE,The staff were very nice. Very helpful.. The rooms were quiet and clean. I am in the medical field and travel frequently so am very picky about the cleanliness of a motel room. It felt clean and I appreciate that. You need to open the cafe back up for regular service. The staff works to hard the way it is being done now. They have to work the front desk then run in take orders and serve food. Too many different duties though they do a super job.
NEUTRAL,"Location 1. A/c was motion sensor activated and would heat the room up to 74 degrees if movement was not found. Kept having to get up to keep room cool. Didn't sleep 2. Sheets did not fit the bed and kept coming off the mattress. The mattress pad was wrong size it was a queen size mattress pad on a king size bed. Holes were in the sheets, a piece of broken off plastic fork was found under the sheets as well."
NEGATIVE,"It was convenient. It was not a nice hotel. Upon check-in, the clerk was on the phone and apparently the caller was asking for directions. He was not very nice to them. I checked in and tried to order pizza. The key card had Domino's on it and a number. That Domino's told me that they did not delicver to the location. The same Domino's number was listed in the Guest Services booklet in our room. There were several other restuarants listed that also did not deliver to our location. I called the front desk and the clerk was not very helpful. He stated that he had a menu at the front desk for a place that did deliver. I had to walk up to the desk to get this. I was not very pleased, as it was 9:00 at this point. The toilet in my room was dirty, and the lock on the sliding glass door was broken and hte screws that held the lock in the wall were falling out of the drywall. I certainly would not reccommend this hotel to anyone, especially at $122.00 per night. Way overpriced for poor quality and cleanliness."
POSITIVE,"Good value for the money, clean, comfortable, good service, decent breakfast. Parking was a little scarce on Saturday evening, we had to park in the back of the Denny's lot, which was no problem. Just 20 feet away."
POSITIVE,very nice and clean place.during road constructions the staff helped us a lot to guide us to hotel.
POSITIVE,Very thoughtful decor; nice bright colours and everything matching. Fridge and microwave convenient. Good breakfast although more range for diabetics encouraged but this is true in California as a whole. Although I asked for west or south face window had only a view of the wall. I would have changed had it been sunny. Map of restaurants would be helpful and more info on Fresno. The best stay of 6 accommodations on my California trip.
POSITIVE,Location very convenient Smell of cigarette smoke in room Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"Staff were good, and shuttle was convenient. We were even met at the airport by shuttle staff. Nice spot."
NEUTRAL,Free shuttle service to and from Pearson Airport. Hotel is somewhat old and tired looking. Needs a makeover. Unpleasant smell from the adjacent restaurant in the lobby @ 10PM.
POSITIVE,We chose the Hotel because of its location as we were breaking our journey and only staying one night. We found the hotel very comfortable and affordable. The only negative thing we can say is that the size of the meals were far too large for our English ans (mature appetites) !!
POSITIVE,"Excellent for one-night stopover during Glasgow-Amsterdam- Winnipeg flights. Pressure on the one-man reception staff trying to look after hotel guests, check-ins and phone calls without assistance. Question below â don't know. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Staying at a hotel is not just about one thing, it is the whole package. I like ease of signing in, getting the WiFi number without asking for it from my room, being asked if I needed the shuttle the next morning and the arranging of a wake up call...very smooth. The room was very nicely appointed and clean and we slept quite well. Loved the shower and soft towels. We will stay there again. There was a question about the sheets and whether or not the bed my partner slept in had been changed as it was quite messy when she pulled back the covers. Mine was fine. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"The location, price, service, cleanliness, room decor, and the airport shuttle. We were totally satisfied with our stay at the Best Western Plus Toronto Airport Hotel."
NEUTRAL,"Pleasent service from restaurent staff, even though it was late at night. As a new customer, I was not aware that I had to call the shuttle. There could be a reminder to customers to call the shuttle and it should be a 1-800 number. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,Price was unbeatable. Not even the 5 star hotels offered free buffet breakfast. Room service came too early. Parking lot at hotel was always full so we had to park at the hotels other lot around the corner. No shower caps Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,"The staff was really friendly and helpful. The pillows were awful, not much room between the bed and the desk."
POSITIVE,Location & price Small exercise room Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,I loved the shower and the big bed. The extra room
POSITIVE,"I was worried after I booked because I read bad reviews. We usually stay at the Embassy, but it was sold out. Well, this hotel must have new management because everyone was friendly, especially Chris at the desk, the rooms were clean, smelled fresh, had decent A.C., pretty view, it's quiet, and is close to town. We loved eating breakfast by the pool and adored the fresh waffles! Great value!"
POSITIVE,After checking in we found the hvac unit to be malfunctioning. The desk clerk was very understanding and moved us to another room. His demeanor and friendliness was above average and hence the good review for the hotel.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is amazing as value for what you pay compared to the hotels around them. The room is relativlysmall but clean and bed is comfortable. The hotel is very good for short stays with average budget. The hollywood av. (main attraction) is 12 mn walking and 5 dollars taxi. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful, did you? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,The position is ideal to visit hollywood spending the right money. The room was silent though the hotel is very close to a big street. Room was very small and there was some smell tipical of the moquette. Week-end rates higher then during the week. If you want to stay one day (more then in half for that area) book during the week.
NEUTRAL,"Big room , value for money. The breakfast is good with helpful waitress. The receptionist is not well equiped with information about direction."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was a tad small, but very clean. I wasn't there to hang out in the room anyway. AWESOME location. Just a few blocks from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell and surrounded by bars and night clubs. I'm not into clubs or swanky bars, but there is a great little Irish Pub that was just what I was looking for. Easy walk to the subway as well. We did not have problems with the ""nightlife crew"" either (loud people, loud music). You couldn't hear anything. I would stay again. The thermostat in the room. I couldn't get it to the perfect temp. No worries though, I just turned the fan on. It was a very minor detail."
POSITIVE,"Excellent location for visiting the stunning Bryce Canyon National Park. Friendly staff, comfortable room, good facilities and excellent breakfasts. Limited options of evening eating within Bryce Canyon city, especially as one of the few restaurants was closed whilst we were there, but this should not detract from the quality of the hotel. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Preservation of history, bedding Food in at complimentary breakfast service timing"
NEGATIVE,"Ocean view Price. Room size, hard bed"
NEUTRAL,"Location, helpful staff Breakfast could be improved and the sitting area is limited."
NEUTRAL,"Clean room The receptionist made a mistake during check in, that resulted in blocked funds on our bank account. Despite numerous promises from the hotel manager to help, 4 weeks later the amount is still blocked on our bank account. Breakfast is simple, room is relatively small. 5 dollar per luggage storage fee is ridiculous. Rooms are cold even when the heating is on max."
POSITIVE,The hotel staff were excellent and extremely helpful. There was insufficient seating fro customers at breakfast.
NEUTRAL,Being kept awake by the trains going by and the attitude of the check in clerk when I called information on the shuttle. I will never go there again. I went to the restaurant and there was no one seat me.
NEUTRAL,We only stayed one night as we booked the hotel to be close to the airport as my wife and I had an early flight the following day. Didn't have any for the length of time we were there. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"Loved the beds and overall room layout and design. The room was extremely comfortable and ""homey."" The room was very quiet. The breakfast was wonderful! Thank you for a great stay. Nothing. I enjoyed the hotel and its ammenities."
NEUTRAL,The hotel was clean and the staff were nice. The hotel is quite a way outside of town so you definitly need to drive into town which is a shame.
POSITIVE,"Convenience to medical facilities, friendly accommodating staff"
POSITIVE,"having gone to college in lubbock and then discovering this best western on my last visit with my wife to the area, I know this is really as good as it can get in terms of affordable nice room and customer satisfaction in lubbock. The lady at their front desk was very helpful, she made sure we got something in our budget range, the rooms were very clean and up to date, the wi-fi and breakfast were good. The only thing is that the outside of the building needs to be touched up to reflect what goes on in the inside. Liked: Rooms, Service, Food, Value"
NEGATIVE,"So, the Comfort Inn seemed alright at first. That feeling quickly changed when I pulled into the parking lot. The size of the hotel was very small. I almost died when I opened the door of my room. The musty smell of the room penetrated the pores in my face. I constantly started to feel sick. And let's not get started on the beds, the pillows were small and square and couldn't support my head. The sheets felt dirty and I felt very uncomfortable. It felt like cardboard. The bathrooms was also a downfall. It was way too small, it smelled like sweat and urine, and the shower had dirt in it, making my shower unpleasant. Also on arrival, there was spilled milk in the elevator, all over the floor, with no immediate service to clean it. The milk remained on the floor for a couple hours, due to the poor staff. I looked for a long time to find the entrance of the hotel pool, and failed to find it. Upon asking the worker at the front desk where it was, he hissed at me and merely pointed in the general vacinity of the location. I was frightened beyond that point for the rest of my stay. My room was tacky, smelled bad, and was an overall mess. For the best travel experience, do not under any circumstance come to this ""Uncomfort Inn"". Absolutely terrible. Shaking my head."
POSITIVE,"I loved the jacuzzi room, just what I needed to relax! I was surprised at the selection offered at the buffet breakfast. It offered things like freshly made waffles, 2 types of eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, and more. You usually don't get hot items at all when a hotel offers free breakfast. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely come back."
POSITIVE,"We booked this hotel to do a ski trip at Cataloochee and to know the NC mountains. I wasn't expecting a lot, but surprisingly this budget hotel has a great room and great service ! The only down side I noticed is that the breakfast area is small and gets very crowded. Also they could change the old TV's to a flat screen with HD, we are on year 2012, come on! Pleasant, quiet room, clean and helpful front desk staff. This location is about 10 mins away from the ski area and has lots of great restaurants around. Room Tip: Get the ones on the back of the hotel to avoid noise from the street."
NEUTRAL,"We needed a place to stay on a trip to SC and this fit the bill. It looks like it was recently redone. It was clean and the lobby looked brand new. After a long day on the road, my kids wanted to take a swim. The pool was very sad though. It was very run down and a bit dirty. Hopefully that is their next area to redo? If you don't care about the pool, than choose this motel, right off the highway."
POSITIVE,We decided to stay here at the last minute and couldn't find 2 available rooms anywhere else. We got a reasonable deal with our AAA card. The breakfast was pretty good and was kept well stocked. Our biggest complaint was that the wireless internet was very weak! We couldn't even get a good signal in our room. We could pick one up if we went down the hall. I definitely couldn't recommend this hotel if you need the internet while you're there. Room Tip: Close to the elevators if you want internet access.
POSITIVE,"12 of us headed up to Perth Ontario on a golf special. Our overnight accomodation was at the Code's Hotel. What a pleasant suprise. A beatuful hotel just a couple of blocks from the Perth Golf Course and within walking distance to the downtown, where there are some fine restaurants. Great rooms and the staff were very pleasant and accomodating. The continental breakfast was good and the only drawback was that there was no restaurant or bar in the hotel. We will be going back!!!!"
POSITIVE,"A quick trip to Lake George, NY to see 'The King in Concert' @ Six Flags Great Escape starring Elvis tribute artist James Cawley was my main purpose for a visit to the small town of Lake George. The 'Best Western of Lake George' fit my needs perfectly. After a bit of confusion finding my room reservation [thank you Booking.com] I was checked in ASAP. All of the Front Desk staff were kind & cordial. 'Sheridan' was the actual staff member to checked me in. The rooms have good secure locks. No matter the locale, this is always welcome. My room was clean and comfortable. No insects, etc. I checked the moment I entered the room. The bathroom was clean and tidy. I did, however find that the commode requires extra cleaning [minerals/hard water??]. The paint/plaster above the shower/tub was peeling rather badly. That does need to be addressed by Engineering. Not acceptable. My room had a fantastic High Definition television. The bed was firm [just right] & comfortable. The heater worked very well & made the room quite cozy. I'd be happy to stay here again! Great staff!!! Room Tip: This is a two story property w/ no elevator. If stairs are no hardship, I'd stay on the 2nd floor. Its away from the pool/entrances/exits. More quiet."
POSITIVE,"Welcome & greeting was great, cookies, coffee, or hot chocolate awaited us. staff was excellant. Breakfast was a treat and very good."
POSITIVE,we love your hotel but the only things is when we come down there for black friday shopping ... how you let people drink in the pool area they get drunk and there little kids running around sign and there was a sign that says no one under 18 allowed in the hot tub after 9pm the was kids every were ?
NEUTRAL,"We arrived late Saturday evening at the Vancouver airport, staying one night before heading off to the cruise terminal downtown. We chose the Abercorn Inn because if was close to the airport, offered free shuttle service, and had available shuttle bus fee service to the cruise terminal the next day. We were told the airport shuttle ran at 15 and 45 minutes after the hour, and true to word the bus was there at exactly 9:45 PM. Check in service in the small lobby was fast and pleasant. We wanted a quick bite to eat. The on-site restaurant service closed at 10 PM but we were able to get a very good Shrimp Caesar salad in the bar. The facility was still undergoing renovation as there was a pallet of new mini-fridges by the elevator. The room was on the small side but was clean and comfortable. As we had checked in late, we just wanted a place to bed down. The 3rd party shuttle bus to the cruise terminal was on time in the morning. The desk clerk arranged it for us. The biggest negative was the free breakfast which was horrible. Of course, it was crowded due to other cruise passengers being on site. But breakfast selections were meager and not very good. Definitely below average even for a free hotel breakfast. Other than that, service was commendable, the place was quiet, clean, and comfortable, and the price competitive. I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I travel into the area quite often and have been staying at the hotel for a number of years. The conveniently located Best Western will give you excellent value for your money. The rooms are spacious, clean and very well appointed. The breakfast offering is quite sufficient and there is a small but more than adequate fitness room. Most important, the staff is extremely competent, warm and welcoming, always going out of their way for me. I can't imagine you'd be anything but very satisfied after your stay here."
NEUTRAL,Right off the highway. Good location. Lots of shopping around. Hardest mattresses ever made! Never came to fix the jacuzzi in bathroom. One night is all I can stand thanks to the bed made from cinder blocks.
POSITIVE,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The pool was nice, the rooms were clean and well-kept, and service was awesome. They also have hot breakfast in the morning which was really good. If you have dogs, they are dog friendly + there are two good parks across from the hotel on the waterway that are great for taking dogs for a walk. We were right downtown and not too far, about 10 minutes, from Folly Beach. Great trip. We will definitely stay here again & hope to return soon."
POSITIVE,"There are dozens and dozens of billboards on the westbound side of I-90 directing you to stop in Wall! The Badlands National Park starts just a ways east of Wall, and by the time your busily tour the Badlands, you'll want a quick and easy place to stop and rest. Luckily, the Best Western Plains Motel was very near the end of the park! We stayed at the Best Western during Sturgis week; there were bikes absolutely everywhere. We were lucky to have found a room, so we were really grateful when it turned out to be a very pleasant stay. Despite it being bike week, the party mostly stayed downtown Wall (if you can call it a ""downtown!"" It's a 100-200 yard divided road down a string of shops with novelties of the old west - definitely worth the stop!). The room was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was a surprisingly peaceful stay. The one thing you HAVE to try is the soft water! It was incredible, and something we'd never experienced before! I took a picture of the sign on the mirror next to the bathroom in the room. The novelty of the water didn't wear off even over the past 3 months. We paid a whopping $180 for this room - the most expensive room on our 2 week cross-country road trip. We had been planning on camping in the Badlands, but due to the weather, we wanted a room. We booked only a few hours before showing up during Sturgis week, so we sucked it up. I'm not sure what the rates usually are, but for this night's rest, it was worth it!"
POSITIVE,"We were on a short visit to Monticello and vineyards in the area and chose to stay overnight here. Fine, clean place with friendly staff. The continental breakfast offered a variety of choices and was tasty. Would stay here again if in the area."
POSITIVE,"My family and I stayed here for four nights and it was a very positive experience. We had a remodeled room and it was very clean. The cleaning ladies left a note, cleaned daily, and even explained one time why one bed was not made (they are prohibited from touching personal belongings that were left on the bed). I really think this was a great value as it included a basic breakfast. We had a view of the bay and no issues with noise even though it was pretty busy. The customer service was fine, nothing out of the ordinary from the front desk, but definetly friendly enough. I found the best deal through the Best Western website and not through the hotel itself. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great value and great location. Room Tip: Go through the Best Western website especially if you are planning to stay a few night as they will..."
POSITIVE,This was a lovely hotel ..... the fact they had an adjoining restaurant with GOOD FOOD was another plus. Breakfast in the morning was terrific as well. Very nice pool area .... great for families!
POSITIVE,"We just returned from a 63 day trip across the Northwest & Southwest, which means we stayed in about 45 properties and this was the second best place we stayed. The best was the Alyeska Resort and it cost three times more than this Best Western. What I liked was the bathroom and the bedroom. The bath had great towels, curved curtain rod and a great shower head. The bedroom was spacious with a huge flat screen HDTV with good cable There was excellent Wifi. The breakfast was continental plus (there was scrambled eggs, sausage and gravy). All in all, this was a great place to stay."
NEGATIVE,"Was booked into this hotel for my first trip to America with work staying on my own,if his hotel is an example of hotels in America I dont want to go back. All the reviews here, except the good ones are true very scarry at night woken up both nights at two in the morning by young ladies knocking on the door luckily the door had two locks ,a chain and a spyhole, of course this may appeal to some people as the hotel was full ! couldnt wait to get away. Room Tip: Go to another Hotel"
POSITIVE,"Our vehicle's lights went out in Zion's tunnel and we crept down to find the lights at this wonderful little community! The staff heard our story and everyone was there to help us! The rooms are spacious and clean. Breakfast is included in the rate. The restaurant and gift shop are right at the hotel and stay open late! We would recommend this place for anyone wanting a friendly, BEAUTIFUL place to stay!"
NEGATIVE,"First the good. The only reason I am giving them a 2 star is because the staff was friendly and tried to accomodate us and they also had a continental breakfast which is good when your on a road trip. The bad, the room smelled really bad, like someone had urinated in the room. We found out that the majority of the smell was coming from the air conditioner. The phone didn't work, the beds were uncomfortable and the bathrooms were pretty disgusting. We felt like we were going to catch something from the room. We were travelling during the Sturgis bike rally, so hotels were all booked up, otherwise we would have left. I was told that the rooms on the second level were better but we couldn't switch as they were sold out. The other thing thing was we enjoyed the other people in the hotel. Becauseof the bike rally people were super friendly, sitting outside and sharing some drinks and stories. Room Tip: I was told the rooms on the second level were better, so you may have better luck than me."
NEGATIVE,"The rooms on main floor were musty smelling & carpets were damp....got moved upstairs & by morning water was squishing between your toes from the wet carpet...maintenance was called & found ""plugs"" missing from airconditioiner unit & water was coming back into the room..........came back that evening & carpet was STILL soaked..seems like they.hadn't even been wetvac.......got moved to another room....really how is that a pleasant stay....NEVER AGAIN!!..........very poorly maintained :( ...it was close to main mall.....but found others closer"
NEUTRAL,"Staff charming, dirty pool even though it s not the time a year come on lets clean the pool up!WIFI is almost non existing can get it from Days INN and it will stay up longer than what this hotel has,now to add insult to injury cable is off! Bed's are so so have stayed in others where beds alot better,breakfast you better be down there @ 6 because if you leaving out late and go in @ 8;50am hope you like cereal because they didn't fix anything for late comers... Room Tip: good luck pick the back side right at I-20 maybe they will let you pick they didn't us even though my roomate is handicap,we had to go upstairs"
NEGATIVE,I traveled with my 7 yr old son for a hockey game. When we first checked in I thought it was fine. The room was clean and we threw our luggage in the room and took off. However we returned it was around 10:00 at night and there was a large group of people partying everywhere. There was a strong odor of smoke of different sorts if you know what I mean. No one bothered us and we went to our room. But it was very loud and unless your part of the party I wouldn't stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Had a very pleasant stay at this hotel that is minutes from the Washington,DC area. Hotel is located near highways leading to and from major roadways and very close to the airport. Hotel staff is very pleasant and helpful. Rooms are clean and comfortable and the bed was very soft if you prefer soft mattresses. Free parking is available in either indoor garage or outdoor lot. Would recommend this hotel if you are looking for something inexpensive and close to Washington. Great for short stays."
POSITIVE,"This is a relatively new Best Western. It has great parking, a large and well appointed lobby area. The rooms are very comfortable, in size and accommodations. They are clean!!! We've found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The continental breakfast is on the scant side, but if you're looking for toast, hot/cold cereals, juice, coffee and make them yourself waffles you'll be satisfied with the selection. We'll stay again when we return."
POSITIVE,"I recently had another stay at Macies Best Western when I was in Ottawa visiting family. The rooms are very good - clean, spacious, and well appointed (the internet connection is easy and very fast). The location is very good - access to the main highways is convenient and it's so quick to get from the hotel pretty much anywhere in Ottawa you want to go. Highly recommended."
NEUTRAL,"I liked the size of the room. The beds were comfortable and pillows were nice and soft. My only complaint, the bathroom. Very cramped. Our bathroom had grout on the tiles and the toilet paper holder was full of dust. The bathtub curtain reeked of mildew. Complained thrice before it was replaced in the morning by housekeeping. That totally grossed me out. Breakfast was average. Liked the idea of free DVDs at the reception with a good selection. Reception staff were nice. Ample parking. Coffee available all throughout the day. Freshly baked cookies in the afternoon, but the quantity offered is very less considering the number of guests in the hotel. All gone by the time you know it. I don't think I'd stay again though. Ramada and Hampton are much superior and within the same price range."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I recently had a chance to stay at this Best Western in Portsmouth,NH and what a very nice place it was. The staff went out of their way to see that we were well taken care of. A map of the city was provided, a life saver, for Portsmouth has a lot of oneways, alleys,parking here but not here. The staff told us which streets to use, where to park,etc. the room was very nice, and well priced. We will use this hotel again if we ever visit this city in the future."
POSITIVE,"For those who are traveling between Ontario, Canada and Orlando, Mt. Airy, North Carolina is about half-way there. We booked this hotel using Expedia and got a great rate. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the accommodations and the friendliness of the staff. I spoke to the hostess and she told me what the nightly rate would be if we had booked with the hotel directly and the price was even lower than Expedia's rate! We stayed at the same hotel on the way home and were very happy with our decision. The one problem we experienced was the TV remote (they use special ""clean"" remotes) didn't work. I made a call to the front desk and they delivered a new, working remote within one minute of my call. Amazing service. The breakfasts are basic, but good (including fresh fruit and boiled eggs) and there is someone who actually refreshes the breakfast bar. Wireless internet is free. Just off I-77, there is a restaurant and gas station right there as well for your convenience. You simply cannot go wrong with the Bryson Inn. Book with confidence."
POSITIVE,"Stopped here on our way from South Florida to Tennessee. The best pet friendly motel we have ever stayed at. The room was clean, spacious and had a separate entrance for us to enter and exit through to the dog walk. The staff was courteous and went out of their way to be sure that we had everything we needed while staying there. Also helpful with directions to restaurants, attractions etc. Breakfast is great with lots of choices. Great TV channel selections and Wi-Fi access is easy. After our trip we stopped here again on our way back to Florida. The return stay was just as enjoyable as the one on the way up. I would recommend this Hotel to everyone. We already have plans for my sister and her family to stay there when they come down this summer. Once again, Best Western really shines. Room Tip: We stayed on the first floor because of the pet friendly rooms. Just be sure to let the Hotel know..."
NEUTRAL,"My wife, our 2 year old, and our 10 month old were flying out of Syracuse and chose this hotel based on it's proximity to the airport, and because they offered on-site parking at the hotel. I had booked a King Suite for the amenities. With two small children I needed a fridge and microwave. When I checked in I was given a double room and informed there were no King Suites available. I wound up keeping all the bottles of formula on ice and heating them up in the sink. Upon check-in I had asked about the airport shuttle in the morning and that I had a 7am flight. I was informed by the Customer Service Manager that the 5:30am shuttle was already booked and I would have to be ready for the 5:10am shuttle. It's a very good thing I was early for the 5:10am shuttle because it filled up and people were turned away. We wound up waiting for quite a long time in the terminal, and in the airport terminal in Syracuse, there is nothing. The hotel itself is not a bad property and appears reasonably maintained, but it is showing it's age. Not much more to be said about that. Although the hotel did attempt to correct some of the shortcomings in the reservation I had made, I would rather they had just honored the one I had made. Also, the airport shuttle was sketchy getting out, because I barely made the early-early one. I don't want to slam this hotel and say it's a bad place, because this establishment may be fine for most of the people who stay here. I just want to say that I stayed here and this was my experience. I would be happy to answer any questions readers of this review may have."
POSITIVE,"Attending a family reunion in Mullins, SC, we stayed at the hotel 3 nights and found it a great hotel. Especially the excellent housekeeping staff. Rooms were spacious and tastefully decorated. Beds a little softer than I prefer, but comfortable. They are constantly cleaning lobby & breakfast area, making it spotless. Housekeeping staff were courteous and spent the whole day cleaning rooms, because weekend has heavy one-night stays. Breakfast bar had waffle maker, sausage gravy for biscuits, grits, cereals & fruit. They did run out of boiled eggs a couple of days, but great coffee & ""real"" orange juice not orange punch. Efficient check-in & check-out, but they stick to the 3:00pm check-in. We had only one problem, due to thin walls. 2 screaming uncontrollable children in the next room. Sounds travel through the thin walls. We were across from the elevator and it was busy & noisy Sat. night, so ask for a room at either end of the hotel if on a weekend. All in all, the cleanliness and courteous staff made up for the noise and no boiled eggs. Would stay there again! Room Tip: At the ends of the hall, not the center near the bell ringing elevator. Also, my son found small misquitoes in his first floor room, probably a defective window, so 2nd & 3rd floor better."
POSITIVE,Stayed there for three nights on a recent business trip. My room wasn't ready yet so they immediately upgraded me to a suite. Room was very nice two rooms and the bed was really comfortable. Room was very clean.The hot breakfast was great. I definitely would stay there again.
POSITIVE,Overall this is a nice motel and the staff was helpful. The rooms are good-sized. Their bathrooms need fans. The bathroom door was warped and hard to shut probably because there's no fan to remove the steam from the shower.
POSITIVE,"Easy to find, spacious rooms, nice televisions, Waffle House in the parking lot. We're usually not wild about exterior access rooms, but we requested one facing the courtyard and felt very safe. Lovely courtyard, by the way, well-maintained just like the rest of the hotel. Get yourself a coupon book from the gas station right next to it and you'll really get a good value. Highly recommended."
NEUTRAL,"We were orininally given a room with two ""double"" beds (which wasnt what I booked), and one bed could not sleep two people comfortably at all. The room smelled awful. I contacted the front desk and they found us a room with a king (which smelled much better) and I appreciated this very much. However, the mattress was very firm and I found it uncomfortable. [?] The indoor pool was set up only for exercise (doing laps) and not so much leisure, which was disappointing because I wanted to swim a little. The surrounding neighborhood was not great and we heard several sirens throughout the night. It was however, close to a lot of shopping and resturaunts."
POSITIVE,"Not a fancy hotel, old even, but if your looking for a clean, quiet, basic hotel this is a less expensive hotel to stay in Columbus. It is at the northern most edge of Columbus, but it is also literally right off the I-71 exit ramp and is in the midst of a medium to low cost range shopping plaza that includes a large grocery stores, a variety of budget [?] and family style eateries, drug stores, and other places to pick up things you might have forgotten on your trip. We have stayed at this place before and other than desperately needing some much more contemporary decor (think 1970's), is good enough for us to have a base of operations when we're in Columbus."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for a few nights on business and was pleasently surprised. I would stay here again in a second. The room was very clean, spotless actually. The beds comfy and the bathroom was clean. The TV and wifi worked great there is also ethernet for hardline connection. It was quiet and the front desk staff were very nice. The breakfast had plenty of offerings for all. In talking with the front desk it looks like the hotel was redone about 2 years ago or so. Great value for the money."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for a 25th birthday trip to Mohegan Sun- perfect location and the limo service to the casino was very convenient. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was helpful and kind. The rooms were spacious and clean. The non-smoking room we booked did smell like smoke and upon telling the front desk, they sent somebody up to note that it smelled [?] so we didn't get charged which was nice. Overall, great pick to avoid the pricey hotels at Mohegan :)"
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for one night while visiting our daughter. We had a two-bed, pet-friendly room. We found the room small, but adequate for our needs. The bed was comfy, but I could have used another blanket. It was clean,well maintained and had an updated decor. The staff at the front desk were very pleasant and handled our transaction well. There was a micro-fridge in the room which would have been nice for a longer stay. The grounds were pleasantly landscaped and maintained--much better than most motels in this price range. Definitely would stay again. Book online at BestWestern.com for best rates."
POSITIVE,"The staff was helpful and friendly, we had breakfast and throughly enjoyed it. We spent one night and will continue to on our way through in April. The bed was heaven, we can't wait to see what our next experience will be like next trip. Room Tip: First floor, you can never go wrong."
POSITIVE,"Everything was great! The rates, location and condition of hotel top notch. I am coming back in a couple of months to see my daughter graduate from Navy Bootcamp and I will be staying with Best Western Gurnee again."
NEUTRAL,no wireless internet- plug in only. dated and worn.
POSITIVE,"The room was huge, we slept really well. The breakfast was pretty good (especially the waffle maker!!) and we were comfortable. The staff were a bit strange, we were checked in by a teenager with no charm at all, and on check out the manager seemed a little like Basil Fawlty! But it was a good stay for what we paid."
POSITIVE,"I stopped here on my way home from Florida. Check in and out went well. Very large, clean room and bathroom. There is a nice Denny's Restaurant attached to the hotel that gives a 20% discount to guests."
POSITIVE,"It is convenient to freeway and easy access to San Francisco, where we had business. The hotel is clean, rooms are large with adequate closet space and amenities like refrigerator and microwave. We were accomodated with a quiet room away from the freeway, and it was, indeed, quiet. Staff is friendly."
POSITIVE,"Nice and clean room, reception staff very helpful and friendly, no problems!"
POSITIVE,It is a well located hotel with very good front office attention. The breakfast is adequate and there is good coffee almost all day.
POSITIVE,"The room was really lovely. The staff on check in was great. Staff on checkout was awful..rude and made objectional comments about another customer in front of me. Not helpful at all. The price of food at the restaurant was on the high side. Stayed here bnecause of the location, close to the airport, we only were there overnight, but the staff had no print out info on hoiw to get to the airport, which would have been helpful to us. We try to use Best Western as much as we can."
POSITIVE,I was surprised that the room was so spacious and lovely. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite. It was very comfortable..The staff was also very friendly and helpful.
NEUTRAL,"One of the most comfortable beds we have ever experienced. Baji at the front desk was surly and not helpful. Lloyd, on the other hand, was very professional and helpful. No tea in room, just coffee, getting tea was way harder than it should be. Open-air bar next door will keep you awake until 2:00 am. The ""upgrade"" from our Deluxe King to a ""Deluxe Family Suite"" is not recommended. Make sure you get the room you booked, not the upgrade. Tv in one room, master bed in the other. Rooms are tiny and not very well maintained. Had to go to another room to use the hairdryer!"
POSITIVE,"Hotel is lovely,great view from rooms. This time they were adding on and the workers woke us up very early Saturday morning. It was very noisy. Also at breakfast all the workers were taking a break and eating with the guests. It was very crowded. I would have thought the hotel would have made other arrangements for the workers"
NEUTRAL,"I stayed at the Best Western because I had an exam that was being facilitated there in the morning. I requested a late check out so that I wouldn't have to rush through the exam and my husband could relax. Instead, I was given a locker and my husband had to sit in the lobby for 2 hours after check out time. I was told that a big group was coming in and I couldn't have a 1:30 check out instead of 11:30."
POSITIVE,"Free on site parking, room rates, bed and pillows, free shuttle service and breakfest, noon checkout. Can't think of a thing bad, but we were only there 1 day. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"These rooms are accessed from the outside. There's not interior hall. This worried me a little, but I was upstairs and felt safer. The door was difficult to close from the outside, but not from the inside. The room was very clean and seemed updated to me. I liked that. I would have really liked to have a fridge, though. I felt that was the only thing [?] lacking."
POSITIVE,It was clean and very well positioned to the expresway. The breakfast was good also.
NEUTRAL,"Linens were clean. There wasn't a DVD player. VHS's are out of date. Pool was freezing cold, while the hot tub was scorching. I couldn't even dip my feet in because the chlorine levels were burning my eyes. We were excited to stay here so we could introduce our daughter to swimming for the first time, but we were seriously let down."
NEUTRAL,Not much selection in High Point. Room was large and comfortable. A little dated. Internet did not work well. They need to get wireless for the entire hotel. Bar service was horrendous and bartenders were not good. It was reunion weekend for High Point University and there was also a high school reunion staying there. They should have been better stocked [?] and prepared. Not many other choices in High point though and the location is good.
POSITIVE,The complimentary breakfast Pillow is thick. Not easy for shopping and walking out is not so safe. Good for people who need to take early flight. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,"jacuzzi in room, very nice after a lang flight; large room, comfortable bed poor breakfast, toilets near breakfast area were very dirty"
NEGATIVE,"Location at the airport The staff did not advise us when we phoned to cnfirm our arrival that the entrance to the hotel was flooded and we would not be able to get in until they sent their bus out to collect us. We then had to wait almose one hour, and eventually managed to climb over a wall from an adjoining property to get in to the hotel. No apologies from the staff. There did not appear to be anyone in charge, no manager to speak to . Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,Clean rooms friendly staff
NEGATIVE,"Location was only good thing. Rooms cleaned once a day -Rooms too small - for example, if you sat on the toilet and got up you hit your head on the doorknob, not good for tall people - no room in bathroom to keep toiletries -Bed was not a queen, just a double -Did not get the right towels etc - was provided with only one facecloth andf one handtowel for two people - asked for a second one two times - when the staff brought up additional hand towel complained of too much work - never got second face cloth whole time there -Tea not provided in room and when I went down to get one was asked to pay $2.00 - for one teabag! And $2.00 for small glass of milk for tea!!!! -Carpet nails sticking up thru carpet around bathroom entrance and around windows. Had to wear shoes whole time. -Was not allowed to use bag trolley - hotel staff had to bring bags up when we were very capable -Any extra amenities cost a fortune!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
NEUTRAL,"This hotel was adequate although a bit pricey for the area. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of parking. Onsite restaurant/lounge, good continental breakfast, and nice pool area."
NEUTRAL,Very helpful front desk staff.
POSITIVE,the room was clean and comfortable and the the rate was reasonable
POSITIVE,"I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Friendly staff, wonderful accommodations, beautiful setting."
NEUTRAL,"walking distance to curling rink toilet didn't flush properly, balcony door to courtyard did not open Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,"I was given a warm welcome, and detailed advice on sightseeing. The staff also helped with internet access, and checkout facilitation. An ordinary hotel made very good by its staff. The attitude of one of the male servers in the restaurant-made me wait for a table even though several were immediately available. Slow, negligent service. The next day I ate there, a lady server was very prompt and efficient."
POSITIVE,Very helpful friendly staff. Cleanliness and spaciousness of rooms. Very good breakfast. Use of shuttle. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"The staff was attentive and helpful. Our room was spotless. Breakfast was great. Loved the on site free parking. Pros: It's cleanliness, the helpful staff. Location: Maneuvered Brooklyn by car with ease from this location. Public Transportation was a few steps from the hotel's front door."
POSITIVE,"In some respects this is an ordinary highway-side hotel, but the room was very clean and comfortable and the staff (from the front desk to housekeeping) were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would stay here again without hesitation."
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our stay and would return.
NEGATIVE,"When we arrived in Atlanta by car we called the hotel for direections and the young lady could not direct us. We called back after being loss for about an hour to see if someone else could direct us, but again she told us an exit to take but we could not find it. We had to distrub friendsat an early hour to get help. Nothing extra like flowers in the [?] room desk chair was old and broken. Tolet bowl had a ring around the upper area. I did not like the hotel! Could hear people talking in the next room."
POSITIVE,"My recent stay at the Best Western Raleigh North hotel was very good. My hotel room was comfortable and clean, the staff were friendly, helpful, courteous, and professional . Next time I'm in Raleigh, I definitely plan on staying at this hotel again. The price, location and staff makes it easy for me to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Raleigh."
POSITIVE,I loved the location of the the hotel it was easy to access from the highway. And was close to the west edmonton mall! I didnt like the the vending machines were all down and there was no continential breakfast for guests
NEGATIVE,The location The housekeeping was far below industry standards. The sofabed was crawling with mouse poop and a huge hairball was on the bathroom floor. Marijuana smoke filled the hallway at night and our replacement room was no better. The couch had crusted vomit on it and the carpet was stained and filthy. My allergies were triggered by the filth and compensation for our horrible experience was not adequate!
POSITIVE,god value friendly people very noisy folks upstairs above us
POSITIVE,"The room was spacious, clean and had free wifi. Good channel selection on tv, easy to find parking and good value for the money. There was definitely someone smoking in their room and we could smell it in the hallway and in our room. The business computer in the lobby was out of order for more than one day."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was excellent value for money. Clean, comfortable and quiet. A good nights sleep! Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,"Rooms are very comfortable - large tv display The coffee was subpar at the continental breakfast. I would recommend offering fresh fruit. Apples, bananas, strawberries, etc."
POSITIVE,"Close to all of downtown events & restaurants, walking distance to the train. Easy check in, room was ready,cool and clean."
POSITIVE,"Hotel met all expectations, would use hotel on returning trips.Pros: Convenience cleanliness hospitable."
POSITIVE,"hotel is close to airport and turned out to be quite adequate for what we needed (a night's stay close to the airport). the staff were helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable. a very nice surprise!"
POSITIVE,Received an early check-in and requested a quiet room as we had been flying all night. Staff was helpful and professional. Room was clean and comfortable. Free breakfast was substanial. Will come back again.
POSITIVE,we needed a place to stay overnight on out trip to San Antonio. This was a good choice.
POSITIVE,"I liked that it was cozy and reminded me of an actual bedroom, not a hotel room. I also primarily booked because it did not require a 2 night minimum. I was very pleased with my stay."
POSITIVE,"Security was terrible, we were woken up at 6:30 in the morning by a stranger banging on our door. We called the front desk and apparently the person had been going door to door on the entire 3rd and 4th floor. Nothing was done about it. I come back to my home town at least twice a year and that alone might be enough for me not to return. Also the T.V. would always shut off go static, or the control would stop working for a few hours."
POSITIVE,"The staff were really friendly. They have loads of tourist information in reception plus a computer with free internet and best of all they have excellent quality wifi in the rooms for free! I also liked the fact that breakfast is included, I thought it would have been just bread and butter, but actually they had quite a lot of stuff. Even though the room and bathroom were very clean and the bed is super comfortable, they have old bulky furniture that makes a small room become even tinier and darker. I think they should modernize the rooms a little to make them lighter and more spacious. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
NEUTRAL,Location was great. The accomodations we signed up for were not the ones available when we arrived. We had to choose between a king smoking room or 2 double beds non-smoking. They allowed us to tour the smoking rooms before choosing to see if they did not smell pleasant. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,The location. The staff was friendly.
POSITIVE,"Needs more blankets available, at least as an option. Although the room can be set to any temperature, I like the feel of additional weight when sleeping."
POSITIVE,Pool and hot tub. Breakfast was perfect
POSITIVE,"Pros: Spacious, clean and comfortable room. Cons: Decaf coffee in lobby was cold later in the day.."
POSITIVE,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in - great value. Â  My husband and I have now stayed here every year since 2006 at least once a year - sometimes twice! Â We love the Finger Lakes wineries and this hotel is an ideal jumping off point to visit Keuka and Seneca, in particular. Â  The rooms are always clean and well-kept and the beds are very comfortable. Â We've stayed in the ""presidential"" suite (king suite w/ sitting area) and there's lots of space. Â Showers have the extended curtain bar, bathrooms are done in granite - very nice. Â Most of the king suites also have a refrigerator and microwave. Â So convenient. Â  There is an indoor heated pool, jacuzzi, new re-done workout room with a treadmill, bike, elliptical, weight machine, and a t.v. Â There is also a couple of computers and a printer in the ""business center"" (alcove off the first floor hallway). They have warm cookies available in the afternoons and evenings, and the continental breakfast has a variety of local baked goods and a fresh waffle maker. Â The staff is super friendly and has always been really nice and helpful. Â  The only downfall is that there's not a whole lot of places to eat nearby unless you want to order takeout or eat at a bar. Â Even a drive into Geneva won't get you anything spectacular, but I can't fault the hotel for lack of restaurants. Â  We will definitely be back, again and again!"
POSITIVE,"New, clean hotel. Good breakfast and nice pool area. There was a computer in the room as well, not a common feature."
POSITIVE,Hotel was very clean and quiet. We were a little disappointed that we could not enter the pool area on Labor Day because it was locked. It is a nice area to sit and relax and we were unable to take advantage of it.The hotel is difficult to find because it sits behind another business off the road.
POSITIVE,"I stayed one night at the Best Western in HIgh Point when I was taking my daughter to tour colleges in the area. The hotel was clean and offered complimentary breakfast and cocktails which was nice. Each employee we encountered was very friendly and helpful. One drawback was the parking. Guests are charged $6 a day to park in the city operated garage adjacent to the hotel. Location was good, but our large SUV did not really ""fit"" in the garage. There were not really any restaurants within walking distance but there were many to choose from about a ten minute ride from the hotel. Overall, we had a favorable experience and I would recommend staying at the Best Western Plus High Point."
POSITIVE,"Location was right on the bus line so getting around the city was easy. Also, it is near to many types of restaurants. Parking was a bit of a problem because the lots are too small when the hotel is busy."
POSITIVE,Price - #1 Comfort #2 Location #3
POSITIVE,This is a wonderful older hotel in the perfect location downtown. Everything was quite nice. Only negative - In the room we stayed you could hear people in the halls and a very loud fan otherwise very nice. Great restaurants and bars all within walking distance.
POSITIVE,"Good for the price, clean, comfortable, and near to the beach / sea front (car is essential, as is the case for Florida in general - driving is so easy). Used this to be near family, was good for the money as a base, no complaints, would use again."
POSITIVE,"Comfortable bed, access to I-95 Upper room request only secured 3rd floor Recommended restaurant across the street had no safe pedestrian access."
POSITIVE,"Free Best Western shuttle between hotel and airport, 10-15 minutes. Also, about same distance from hotel to port where all the major cruise lines depart from. Complimentary breakfast is basic cafeteria style and just ok."
NEUTRAL,"Comfortable bed, access to I-95 Upper room request only secured 3rd floor Recommended restaurant across the street had no safe pedestrian access."
POSITIVE,"Transportation(shuttle) to and from the airport was my main concern since it was a flight layover. Enjoyed the shuttle to mgm Grand where we spent a good 4 hours. Thanks to the shuttle!!! Was very thankful that I chose this property. Clean, nice, ideal location and the deluxe continental breakfast was excellent. Just enough! As a matter of fact, very filling and accommodating! P.S.- the airplane noises did not even bother me, was not even a concern."
POSITIVE,Courteous and helpful staff (particularly the reception desk and bar) Free WiFi - very importnat in today's world for checking email and staying in touch Place looks good and is very clean and comfortable - there's a feel good factor in staying there Good spacios foyer and excellent parking I suggest the only area that neds to be looked at is the breakfast - the selection was extremely poor and some of those tems that were for breakfast had run out by 9am and were not replaced (waffle-mix in particular); this was not replaced even though it ran out at a relatively early stage. The one staff member on breakfast was under pressure. There should be some cereal selection on the breakfast menu; this is normally vailable in Inns. But overall the good points relating to this Inn outweighed the poor breakfast.
POSITIVE,"It was a great value and close to wine country without the huge price. Being so close to favorite restaurants, as well as freeway on and off ramps was a huge plus. The rooms were quiet and beautifully decorated. The pool, while close to the main street, was beautiful with comfortable furniture. We will stay there again. The only thing I can think of is the taste the ice vending machine gave to the ice cubes -- a small thing."
POSITIVE,The location was close to the Strip and convienent for travel to/from airport. We utilized the free shuttle to/from the Strip and that was so easy. The outdoor pool was nice to have. I wish the pool would be open later than 9pm and that the shuttle would pick up later than 11pm. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"this was one of the best hotels we stayed in in Alaska, it was way better than the Denaili Princess Lodge"
NEUTRAL,"Price 10 to 15 min walking distance from down town calgary The hotel is overpriced, but that is probably an issue for a whole Calgary. Otherwise it is tidy but with a bit ""tired"" carpets."
POSITIVE,close to stores and restaurants. Staff helpful. Breakfast every morning Minutes from our destination Felt like home away from home Listened to request for rooms close to each other Farhan allowed us to check in early so we could get on our way Christmas Eve. The decorations were homey.
POSITIVE,"I have stayed here 3 times now, and I have yet to be let down by this hotel. Personell there are friendly, rooms and beds are comfortable, rooms and bathrooms were clean, and service was great. Could not ask for a better place to stay for vacation in Boone NC."
POSITIVE,"We had a nice time at this hotel. The kids loved the indoor pool and game room. We loved the clean, quiet room, free wifi, breakfast, and location. Will be back:-)"
NEGATIVE,Friendly staff and very comfy beds.
POSITIVE,"This was our first time staying at this Motel and we were impressed. It is an older Motel, but it was clean, and the room was nice. The bed was comfortable, mattress was firm. My husband and I could turn over durning the night and not disturb each other with the bed jiggling all over the place. Also it is in a good location, near great places to eat and close to the hospital were my doctor's appointment was. The staff was very nice. We have to come back for more visits to the doctor and I plan to make reservations here again."
NEUTRAL,Staff were very helpfull. The location is quiet. typical continental breakfast.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was the newest, cleanest, busiest hotel on the strip. It was clean and the service was good, although I walked in and was greeted by a sign saying front desk clerk will return shortly and had to wait over 5 minutes before anyone returned. After that, we settled into the small but clean room. Only problem with the sleep was that the hotel was [â¦] quite noisy from this or that machine running out in the hallway. I think there was an arcade game that would go into mock play mode every hour or so! Continental breakfast was basic but did the job. Waffle maker was the highlight. If you have an early flight the next morning, this is an ideal place to stay. Just bring your earplugs."
NEUTRAL,Need to run the filter all the time...not clean
NEUTRAL,"I live in North Vancouver and was working 3 days out in Matsqui on a film set. There was no way I was driving all that way each day with a start time of 6:30am so took a room in this hotel. Nothing fancy at all. But it was clean, comfortable and surprisingly quiet. It is right next to a busy street so I expected to be kept awake all night by traffic but, once the door was closed I didn't hear a thing. I had to ask for some blankets as there was just sheets and a thin coverlet on the bed. But I wrote this in a review they emailed me and they wrote back saying they would be putting blankets in all of the rooms as a result. I had a crap tv and they said they are upgrading to flat screens within a month or so. As well, the pool closes at either 10 or 11 (I can't recall) and after being outside into the night shooting in freezing weather, I was looking forward to a dip in the hot tub but by the time I was ready to go, it was closed. I wrote this in my review as well and was told that, had I asked, they would have let me in. Good to know. So - overall, not somewhere I would stay if I was on vacation but definitely a great stop over on the way somewhere or for someone like me who just needed a quiet place to sleep between work days."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for a short trip to the Blowing Rock/Boone area. Room was very attractively decorated and clean. Great pricing. Friendly and helpful staff. If you want a view, however, ask to be placed on the front side of the hotel. Plan to stay here next year."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here one night after Thanksgiving to visit nearby family - first time visitors. Good location, comfortable, quiet. Liked the convenience of being near everything but did not hear the freeway traffic at all. Indoor pool was warm and fun (a luxury to swim when it was so cold out) and the breakfast had plenty of food options for my spouse (although I have food allergies so I brought my own gluten-free oatmeal). Front desk service was friendly and helpful. All around a great stay and I love that they are pet-friendly as next time we may need to bring our dog. Room Tip: We faced the freeway and were on the lower level and there was no freeway noise. Room 112 I believe..."
POSITIVE,very nice
NEUTRAL,"Staff was great and very helpful. However, walls were thin so didn't solve my getting away from the noise of babies. Wallpaper peeling off the walls and TVs (although worked) were old so programs were cut off. Breakfast was good though!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed in the tower of the hotel. The view was fabulous and the balconies are plenty big enough for several people to enjoy the view. The room was a nice size and the staff was super helpful from the cleaning ladies to the front desk crew. Guest laundry room was super clean and reasonable in price. High speed Internet was free and fast! The room was a bit musty smelling - we slept with our patio door open to combat the smell (we also enjoyed ocean sounds!). Beach rentals available right over the dunes bridge and the pier is a quick walk, too! Definitely worth the price for the tower room!"
POSITIVE,Pros: The staff was friendly & knowledgeable. I loved the jacuzzi.
POSITIVE,"Anyone vacationing in the area should be sure to plan to stay here. We have stayed in many five star hotels and while more luxurious perhaps, none were any cleaner or more comfortable. The beds and pillows were great! The room was spotless and the concept was a lot of fun. We ate at the cafe several times and found the food to be just fine. My onlyÂ complaint is that I would have liked the availability of fresh fruit at the restaurant but that was easily solved with a stop at a local market."
POSITIVE,"On our way to AZ for the winter we stopped here not knowing what we would find. Well, we were pleaseantly surprised. They allow pets and have spacious grounds. Applebees is right next door and very convenient. The included breakfast was excellent and really got us going down the road expecially since we heard there would be blowing snow and 55 mph winds. The bathroom was a little small but the room quiet and nicely appointed. Well worth it! Room Tip: Get a ground floor room with view!"
POSITIVE,"My family loved this hotel. Who wouldn't -- we got to watch a brand new movie out the window of the hotel! It was a very neat experience. The playground was great too -- old fashioned equipment but newly painted and very nice. My only complaints are that they don't provide breakfast, and the sound for the movie could have been better. Other than that it was great!"
NEGATIVE,"The diner and ambiance was nice but the noise level and staff were strange. Friendly enough but kind of cold. Maid service was fine and on time. Restaurant had great food, good prices and was open very late. Free wifi was nice. Parking rate daily was pretty reasonable. It appeared newly renovated and bathroom was huge. Not a very good location and it was a too close to street, so noisy at night. Elevator was tiny. No bell service to help with luggage at all just one lonely luggage cart that barely fit into the elevator. No safe in the room and closet was inconvenient as it was located in the bathroom??"
POSITIVE,Pros: Great price and nice hotel staff. Cons: Had to ask for pool towels at desk-waited 10-15 min for my turn.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is located right across from a shopping center, and is located very close to all of the local restaurants and Appalachian State University. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We had a great stay there!"
POSITIVE,"The new dog park Close to a major road, but not really a problem - no noise issues. It was close to the interstate which was a plus for us. Good location for restaurants, stores, etc. We had a wonderful stay for the Greenville/Spartanville dog show. Our room was clean, smelled good and was well stocked. We have stayed in this hotel the past three years and seen quite a change. They have put in a picnic area and a fenced dog park which makes it really attractive for those of us who attend the major dog show or just really love our pets. The staff has always been friendly and very helpful to us and we will continue to stay at this facility whenever we are in the Greenville/Spartanburg area. We let the desk clerk know how happy we were with our stay."
POSITIVE,"We used the bw Sahara, as a stop off on our trip from Borrego Springs ca to Congress az. The location was convenient and we trusted the name & reputation of bw to provide clean affordable accomodation. THe 'fridge in our room was noisy - we unplugged to in order to sleep better!"
POSITIVE,"The front desk clerk Terri, was wonderful. One party arrived before check in with 5 children. Their room was ready and they were allowed to check in early, which was very nice. They also found us connecting rooms so we could all be together. Breakfast was tasty, with waffles, cereal and assortment of pastries and breads. Will definitely stay again when [?] visiting the area."
POSITIVE,We spent one night at the Rory & Ryan Best Western and it was very nice. The beds were super comfortable!!
POSITIVE,"We were so impressed with everything, the friendly staff throughout the hotel, the cleanliness of our suite, both bathrooms were absolutely spotless!!! The whirlpool actually worked, can't say that about the Hilton Chain - the bed was very comfortable along with the down pillows. The lounge and restaurant were also beyond what we expected. Definetly [?] would recommend a stay at this hotel at anytime - try it and enjoy!!! It doesn't get any better!!!"
POSITIVE,The staff provided excellent support. The 101 restaurant is a asset.
POSITIVE,"Great location, just off Times Square. Staff was exceptionally helpful. The room decor was a bit funky (Bad JFK & Jackie prints and a George Washington bust lamp) and the bathroom miniscule - but overall a good experience. A decent value for the location. Pros: Close restaurants Free Internet"
NEUTRAL,"as a 1st time visitor to see D.C. staff were great at answering our questions, eg, how to get around, etc. hotel room clean but toilet not always flush on 1st flush hotel computer/printer came in very handy.. location great - easy to get to Metro - & other sights that are near by"
POSITIVE,The staff were friendly and well informed. They did ask us to sign a additional document informing us of a disturbance fee which makes sense since it was new years eve. They were polite and explained the additional paperwork. The rooms were clean and that bathrooms well stocked. The rooms were slightly small but tue nice bathroom made up for it. They even provide q tips and cotton balls! Little touches make a big difference. We asked the front desk to call us a cab and it was there in 15 mins and ready for our party. They even knew which cab was for which party. They have a diner attached. Not sure if it is part of the hotel but it was nice to have a place to eat. The elevator was tiny! It was interesting and entertaining trying to get all our luggage upstairs. The rooms are kind of close together.
NEGATIVE,It's a fair stay-over-night hotel to break a long driving distance. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly. Not meant for a holiday. It is in the middle of the desert and it is way too hot.
NEGATIVE,"Great location, about a block away from Times Square. However, problems with plumbing. One room had only hot water, was never fixed, didn't get another room. Rooms really small, service wasn't the greatest."
NEUTRAL,Good location for International Drive and Universal Studios. Room was a good size. Probably the worst Best Western we've stayed in - in urgent need of updating. Our room was large and clean but smelt musty - no fresh air had seen the room for years as you couldn't open the windows and needed redecoration. The bar was stuck in a time warp with outdated murals. A disappointing first experience of Orlando hotels.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is in an excellent location. A short walk to Bourbon St, Harrah's Casino, the Ferry to Algier's Point and/or Gretna, and streetcars to the Garden District and Mid City. The hotel does have a bar but I never saw any one there during my 6 day stay, but you're in the French Qtr so it really doesn't matter!"
NEUTRAL,"Just 3 blocks from Union Square with good access to all major attraction in the city. The rooms are small and the maintenance is as bad as it gets. We change room after the first night due to smoke (!) coming from the heater. In the second room the toilet broke down after the first use. The staff is all smiling and lovely but incompetence completely. As for the vintage elevator, don't try to use it with more than two passengers and two bags. The complimentary breakfast is a nice treat."
POSITIVE,"location off the interstate fantastic We enjoyed our experience at this hotel, and would highly recommend others to stay here."
POSITIVE,"This is such a great spot! Just a Great ""Feel"" to it! The new layout and the size and feel of the rooms makes it feel like you're not in a hotel. The staff shines Jerry, Alan, Corey and Ken are just some of the hardworking, friendly staff that makes me love my home away from home, and helps make Chicago a city I love to visit! No breakfast spot, but there,s a coffee shop accross the street. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
NEUTRAL,Okay hotel for a night or two for people visiting the university or on business. Very good.value and generally comfotable but not well appointed enough for families.
POSITIVE,quarto pequeno.
NEUTRAL,Apart from the fact that the room safe didn't work (they got me a new one) it was a pleasant place to stay. 30 minutes walk from South Beach but there's a frequent bus service.
POSITIVE,"We returned to the Grand Strand oceanfront building after having been away for 5 years; this time, we brought 2 other couples with us. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our beautiful vacation. It's the best place to stay in Myrtle Beach, especially in early Sept. without the crowds, but with sunny days & warm water. Dennis was once again very helpful with plans for golf. Although our friends had some trouble with their key and safe, both problems were handled immediately. We called looking for a cork screw, and it was delivered promptly and with a smile! We'll always stay here whenever we want a lovely Myrtle Beach vacation. Room Tip: If you choose a king room in the oceanfront building, ask for one above the 2nd floor to avoid the p..."
POSITIVE,"Staff made every effort to accomodate our special request for a room for a guest with limited mobility. The rooms were clean and well decorated. The free breakfast was very good, with quite a variety of food and drink items."
NEUTRAL,Location was convenient The room smelled of smoke and did not have great air flow.
POSITIVE,"This smaller hotel is about 20-25 minutes north of Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Terminal, and offers,for $5.00, a shuttle to pick you up from and take to either. Just phone from either location. Staff are friendly and helpful; spacious room, great mattresses, clean and attractive; free ample tasty breakfast; lovely pool with Tiki bar and a complimentary drink. It is close to: restaurants; a lovely Mall with Target, Marshalls, etc. and you can take a public bus to a Kmart. They honor some discounts like online booking, AARP/CAA, etc. This was my second stay and was recommend to me by friends. Just Judy 2010 Room Tip: 2nd floor rooms facing the pool still quiet and picturesque."
NEUTRAL,"Although this hotel may have recently had some room furnishings and the lobby updated, it is still an older hotel. The doors and windows don't seem too secure. But the complementary breakfast had a good selection, and the staff were friendly. The hotel is located right at the entrance to 240 and near the mall. It's only about 10 minutes drive to downtown."
NEGATIVE,Hotel very near to shopping and tourist spots . The bed is so small and I think smaller than queen size . Imagine two adults sleeping on that size of bed . The wifi connection is so bad . I call for opening of safe and took more than 1 hour . Hotel staff rude because I am a Malaysian Chinese . The price I am paying for USD 3k for 4 nites for 2 rooms I can get 6 stars in my country . TV channels cannot be connected because of weak or no signal inputs ! However the Japanese & Siagon 48 restaurant & Breakfast is good . City tour & guide is good but water taxi cruise is racists ( he ask everybody where are they from & when my turn he turn againresubmission away twice ) . Washington tour meant to be English speaking but spoken Spanish ! I won't recommend this hotel !
POSITIVE,"This is a good place to stay if you are traveling with a pet; there are several places to exercise and TCB for your pooch. Our daughter goes to school at SSU, and after trying just about every place that accepts pets in the vicinity, we feel this is the all around best choice. It's a pretty typical Best Western, but it's always clean, the beds are comfortable, and the service is friendly. The rates are quite reasonable, especially compared to other hotels in the ""wine country."" Breakfast is included, and there were several choices, including waffles, fruit and hard-boiled eggs. My only complaint is that the TV didn't get the Giants game; the channel selection was very limited. Room Tip: Rooms by the freeway can be noisy"
NEUTRAL,"All in all it was a good stay. I traveled with 5 kids and the suite we had was plenty big. The room was clean, fresh towels, pool was nice,some appliances need to be updated for what we paid for the room but, they all worked. Front desk waspolite. Wish they had some kind of returns for the things we left. They did serve breakfeast daily but we never made it so idk about the food.Very short drive to sea world and it is one block from the mall. Lots of choices to choose from when needing a store."
POSITIVE,Overall the hotel was good. Stayed for two nights and the breakfast was better the 2nd morning. Staff were friendly and the place was clean.
NEUTRAL,"The Hotel is ok but certainly not great as some tripadvisors write. On the positive side the rooms are really large and well equipped and clean, staff was friendly and the location is ok. Unfortunately in our room (225) obviously smokers had left a disgusting smell of cigarettes. It seemed also rather odd to us that on our arrival the room door was totally open - so flies and some leaves had found their way into it. Do not rent a room with jacuzzi: it is not worth the extra money, the water is brown due to rust."
NEUTRAL,La situation dans Manhattan Le service n est pas a la hauteur
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here while on a last minute business trip. I chose it because of the rate and its proximity to the Oakland airport. The free breakfast was quite nice all things considered (cereal, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, pastries, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, bread, bagels, waffles and fruit in the breakfast buffet). The room was spacious and comfortable andÂ clean. The pillows were soooo comfy! I really appreciated that b/c I often have a very difficult time sleeping in hotels. The only real down side is the neighborhood. Mostly industrial. And it was really hard to find the hotel--there's a Hegenberger Drive, Hegenberger Loop and Hegenberger Court or some such thing. It was really confusing. There is a Starbucks nearby and a Walmart. Not many other places to eat that I could see. It's not far from the stadium where the Oakland A's play. Just a block away from the 880 freeway so getting around is easy. If I was making the same trip for the same purpose again, I would probably stay there again. For a thrifty traveler, I think it's a decent option."
POSITIVE,We spent one night (four of us) in a double queen room. The room was clean and perfectly adequate. It was a very convenient location to downtown and the front desk was very friendly. Continental breakfast had one of the larger selections I have seen recently. I would definitely stay there again on the next trip to Asheville.
POSITIVE,Location was perfect! Fire station around the corner!
POSITIVE,"We booked this hotel online and it looked nice but you just never know till you get there. We were pleasantly surpised to see that the pictures did not lie. Our room was renovated and modern and very clean. The amenities....pool, fitness were all there for your enjoyment. The continental breakfast was quite good. The location was perfect for shopping and dining. I found this hotel lived up to their advertisement and was great value for our money. We will definitely stay there on our next visit to NY."
POSITIVE,"Wow, This is the best location in red river for the summer. the nights out back along the river in the area that the hotel has fixed up with chairs and fire pit i awesome. The room was fine-nothing to write home about and the tub drained s l o w l y. we slept with the windows open in the unit facing the river in the rear of the property and the sound of the river was just awesome. The a/c was nice-we didn't use it. The staff was amazing and attentive and friendly and engaging. Go there for the location and the evenings along the river in the summer-just awesome The room is 3 star."
POSITIVE,Pros: Quality of the room and the size. Cons: Towel was dirty in friend's room.
POSITIVE,"In early June, several friends and I left AZ on our way to a ranch in Bridgeport, CA. After 7 hours of driving, we needed a place to stay for the night. I had already reserved a room at Best Western Hi Desert Inn in Tonopah. There were three of us, and I had requested a room with three queen beds. Our room was ready when we checked in. It was freshly redecorated, very clean, and the beds were quite comfortable. We had dinner at a little place in town, went to sleep and got up fairly early the next morning. Our rate included a full breakfast which was delicious. When you are passing through Tonopah, stay at the Hi Desert Inn. It was a pleasant surprise."
NEGATIVE,Location
POSITIVE,"For the 3rd year in a row, I spent most of January at BWGSIS... it makes January in the Payroll Business amost something to look forward to. With the hours, stress & deadlines placed on payroll companies, January can be Brutal. My room at the Best Western was a welcome relief at the end of the day... my Oasis in the Desert. So convenient, quite and comfortable. Beds and pillows make me want to take THEM home. I didn't need a lot of services, but when I did... extra towels, wake up calls, etc ... it could not have been better. This property has the traditional style that made beach trips enjoyable... full size Stove, Sink & Fridge ... the kind of room that feels more like a condo. And they are constantly improving and maintaining the property. Just Try it, you'll see !!"
POSITIVE,"This was our second time in Sedona. We were traveling with friends through the ""grand circle"" and found Best Westerns to be very good lodging. We stayed at the creekside villas for two night and wished we could have stayed longer. The villas were huge two-story, two bedroom apartments with spacious well decorated living room, dining and kitichen, fireplace, balcony on each level overlooking wooded creek and one in the front too. It was a short walk up the hill to lots of dining places and shops. A little pricy, but ok if you are sharing the cost. Staff was great with our last minute reservation -- (we cancelled the previously booked hotel at the far south end of town, because it was definitely not up to par with the rest of our ten day trip.) There was a nice breakfast buffet with patio seating available to take in the magnificant views in Sedona. We will go back and will try to use our timeshare exchange the next time. Room Tip: Try to get a villa overlooking the creek at the back end of the property"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was renovated, new furnishings in the room. Nice flat screen TV, fridge and microwave in the room. Bed was comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is right down the street from Universal Studios and close to International Drive. Everything available in the area, park, shopping and restaurants. Pros: Close restaurants"
POSITIVE,"If you are looking for a very economical hotel with a great staff, great free full serve breakfast, and easy access to all eateries, shopping, etc. then this is the place to stay. The rooms are a little small but well equiped with a microwave, andice box. I was pleasantly suprised at how much you get for the price. Loretta, the front desk clerk was very helpful and friendly. I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"My stay at the Best Western Blue Angel was all I wanted and more. For about two weeks, it like a home. The staff was always friendly, and some even knew and called me by name. I really appreicated how much they know about the area, where to go, where to eat, and what to do. There was nothing that they couldn't or wouldn't do to help out-and that alone made the trip. But on top of that, the room was top-notch. Soft and always freshly made bed, a bath tub with jets-quite the unexpected surprise, and the cleaning staff took care of everything, or didn't, depending on what I needed done. There were only two down sides. One was the distance from down town. It took a bit of driving to get to the places I wanted to visit-but the quailty was well worth the sacriface. Two was the pool. When you think hotel with a pool-you think 'awesome'. But you can do better at your neighboors backyard pool. It was okay, but I wouldn't advertise as having a pool-it was more of a puddle. But other than that, I was really glad with my stay-and sorta sad to leave. If I'm ever back in town-i know where I'm staying. And having spoken about the place to friends of mine heading to Pensacola-they didn't even look at rates or other hotels, they stayed at the Blue Angel-as you should too. Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet Quiet friendly staff"
POSITIVE,The location The price
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed my stay here with my partner overall. It was quiet, clean, in a romantic setting next to the mountains. Room had a fireplace that kept the place warm, but not too hot. It was modest, with a modest, mid-grade, bathroom, no frills. The value was good; included a decent breakfast, although don't go too late as the breakfast room fills up. The toilet has flushing issues, but nothing too severe. I'd come to this place again, if I were to visit Sedona again."
POSITIVE,"Great location, clean rooms, friendly staff & delicious free breakfast every morning & great amenities. Room Tip: Check out the creek in the rear of the hotel."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for 5 days in August. The grounds and the views are simply beautiful. I liked the hotel's location at the end of uptown, away from the crowds but able to walk to anywhere uptown. Staff were very friendly, housekeeper was exceptional. Would definitely stay here again! Room Tip: Ask for a room with a view of the red rocks"
POSITIVE,Value Street Noise
POSITIVE,"The location was spectacular, very close to Times Square and a subway station. Most of the staff was very polite and efficient (ignoring there was an obnoxious lady at the reservations desk) and the bed was extremely comfortable. The lady at the reservations desk by the door was a bit nasty on the afternoon of April 2nd. The bed, although very comfortable, was much too small for 2 people. It was both short and straight, so we were uncomfortably tight. Our shower (room 204) had no hot water. Warm at best. Not cold. That was a big downer, seriously!"
NEGATIVE,Just spent two days at the Best Western in Kendal Fla - it was fine. Got here for two days and it was a step down from our previous stay. No towels at the pool for two days. Internet was down for two days - can the hotel really operate without theinternet or is it just the guests connection? I returned to find a cot in our room - I didn't ask for one - who did?
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, great service and location. Very comfortable bed. Our room 428 was very noisy as it was close to lift., But ok if the aircon was going. Walls a bit thin as you can hear the person speaking next door."
POSITIVE,"Booked reservation online only seeing the pictures on their website. Very impressed! Clean, close to everything, high end, luxurious! Breakfast was from 0630-0930 amazing for the traveler with a varied schedule! Great military rate and friendly staff. Literally blocks from Valley High gate at Lackland. 10 minutes from downtown. Would definitely stay again!"
POSITIVE,"We relaly loved this hotel, the room was large and comfortable and in the corner was a gas fire with real flames. We went in Nov so the evenings were cool and the fire made it so cosy. Carmel is a wonderful place, well worth turning off Highway 1 to explore and enjoy a walk along the beach."
POSITIVE,"We chose this hotel because of its location to Mohegan Sun and the price. Got a great deal with AAA card - $107 a night. Yippee! Our room was on the 4th floor. Was very clean and spacious - a suite with a king bed and a separate sitting area with a pull out couch, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker and sink. The room looked like new...carpeting, appliances and bed spread/pillows - ALL very nice and clean. The fridge was quiet. We requested a room at the end of the hall away from the elevator. There was a free shuttle to the casino that ran from about check-in time til 4:00 am! AND...it was a stretch limo...a REAL stretch limo...not just a shuttle van you usually find at a hotel. The driver was a super nice retired gentleman who drove once a week for some extra cash. He was dressed up in a nice tuxedo too. He was very chatty, friendlt, and genuinely liked his job. The only downfalls,...and they were minor - it does serve the casino crowd and well, around 1:00 am, we were awakened by some loud gamblers who just returned from Mohegan. They found their room and we could hear them partying some thru the walls but lucky for us, they passed out soon thereafter. Also, if you aren't up ealry enough to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast which runs til 11:00 am (checkout time); forget it. They stop replenishing the eggs, muffins, etc probably around 9:30ish; so there were just scraps by the time we got there. No big deal, there is a greasy spoon almost directly across the street that a local told us about and they served breakfast all day - as do a couple places in the casino. Overall, this is a GREAT place to stay ay about 1/4 of what you would pay to stay at the casino."
POSITIVE,"My family was in town for a wedding and decided to stay at the Best Western Westchase because it was close to the wedding and the excellent rating on trip advisor. The hotel was clean and very reasonably priced. The breakfast and happy hour were both excellent. The employees were phenomenal. They were helpful with directions and transportation ( the desk clerk found us a bus schedule, the cost of a taxi etc...) I get up early in the morning and breakfast was set up on time or early. I asked for a strawberry yogurt and the next morning the breakfast hostess remembered my request of the day before and asked if I would like one. All the staff was so friendly and accommodating for any of our needs. Daniel was outstanding as well as the woman on duty 3-11 on the 23rd. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
POSITIVE,The hotel was very clean with stunning views of the Mississippi River. I will always stay there whenever I'm in St. Cloud.
NEUTRAL,"the hotel was good and the location is very good because it near a lot of places(restaurant ,k-mart, walmart) you can go walking to all his places but the in-door pool is relatively small Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet Quiet"
POSITIVE,"Visited Carmel at Easter and stayed in this hotel..picked it off of the Trip Advisor site. Was very pleased. It is very centrally located, everything is in walking distance. Very clean, good breakfast. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Well maintained with beautiful flowers everywhere! Wish we could have stayed longer... Room Tip: Rooms on back upper floors have a view of the ocean."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night, on our way back home. The room was clean and comfortable. We couldn't use the pool because it was raining, but it looked well maintained. The breakfast was adequate. The best part was the free popcorn in the lobby, what a great idea!"
POSITIVE,At first I thought our room would be a dive from the outside and hallway but our room was a very nice surprise. Large and recently renovated. Very clean room and comfortable bed. Friendly staff and good breakfast.
POSITIVE,"Great location, friendly staff who makes you feel like they really are glad to have you staying with them. Pros: The staff --- primarily Katie went above and beyond to accommodate. Cons: I have nothing to complain about with this hotel. Staff, service, accommodations were all very good."
POSITIVE,"I had a great time in Cody the holet was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpfull I would stay there again. It is well worth the money to stay there '"
POSITIVE,The nicely appointed rooms and the very nice breakfast.
POSITIVE,"I stay here every Wednesday night like clock work! My truck is always safe and in one piece in the morning, it is usually very quiet , and the internet always works! The rooms could us updating but I have inspected the rooms I stay in and overall they are clean and you are safe here! Plus the q.t. across the road has donuts. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value Disliked: Food"
NEUTRAL,We've stayed here before and everything is adequate but front desk staff never very friendly or accommodating.
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here in Feb 2012 and wasn't really satisfied with the size of the room, for the price I paid. However the room was infact clean and neat. Bar was busy at all times, not enough staff."
POSITIVE,"Our family was detoured through Carpinteria due to an accident on the 101 freeway due to the weather . We called the hotel and the Sales Manager was able to save us some rooms, we had a very comfortable stay. We were given rooms in the courtyard, very beautiful rooms,smelled fresh and very cleaned.The next day we spoke with the General Manager to requested a late check out and to reserve a room at another Best Western hotel.She was very helpful and accommodating. The only draw back is that the breakfast is not free like other Best Western's."
POSITIVE,Good location. Nice bar/restaurant. Free internet. Old but clean. Great for a one night stay.
POSITIVE,"always open for a last minute stay. Nice customer service, room needs a little work"
POSITIVE,"I have nothing to complain about here, from the excellent scrambled eggs (I am an se officionado) and bacon to the comfort of the room. Kudos and thanks to the staff for a wonderful stay."
POSITIVE,"We recently booked MANY rooms for an extended weekend at the Best Western in Carpinteria because of our son's wedding. It was truly a pleasure working with Liz Noriega and the entire staff at the hotel. Liz was prompt at answering any and all questions as we prepared for our wedding weekend long distance. Once there, we were all made to feel welcome! The hotel was clean and accommodating to our guests and everyone had a wonderful time. We'd go back in a minute!!!!!"
POSITIVE,Disliked: Service
POSITIVE,"This place was awesome . Of course it's not the hillton but it was everything we needed. Safe area walking distance to the bay. fridge and microwave very large room that was super clean great service awesome pool and hot tub, pet friendly. Free coffee and ice. Free parking and guest parking . All of this for 4 nights 5 days at only 320 dollars can't he beat. Would defiantly stay here again !"
POSITIVE,We were very happy with our accommodations at this hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. One little surprise we were not aware of . Stay and away charges did not cover the full 10 days we were away. It only covered 7 days. Everything else was excellent
NEUTRAL,"other tha getting billed twice for the smame night it was fine,straightening up billing with managment was easy"
POSITIVE,"The best feature is Julie Weaver, at the front desk. She is pleasant, professional, and willing to go the extra mile to insure guest comfort and satisfaction! A real sweetie!! The only downside is the roadwork, which makes it a little difficult to navigate, and lack of good restaurants nearby. (You can only eat at Naked Fish a few times a week, before wishing for some variety) Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook"
POSITIVE,"Visited family in the area and didn't arrive til past 11 pm but was checked in by a friendly clerk. We didn't look around that much, since we were pretty tired. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were plump and soft. The bathroom was clean. It was great to sleep in the following morning, making it to breakfast 30 minutes before they were finished serving. The eggs were ... tough.. chewy... strange way to describe scrambled eggs, but that's about the only way to do it. I chose cereal instead. My husband said the sausage was good. Check out was smooth and we were on our way with a wave and a thank you. Room Tip: Suites are really just one room divided in two by little 'half walls.' Not too crowded, thou..."
NEUTRAL,"Needed a quick spot to stay night prior to picking up kid from camp. Didn't want to spend a fortune so this hotel was most convenient, decent and affordable. However, booked two rooms and they were not close together. The lock in my room was broken and the customer service regarding the matter was lacking. If you are just there for a quick stopover,Â fine. Otherwise, I would recommend one of the other options in the area."
POSITIVE,"Hotel (really an old school motel!) was very old but very well kept and clean. The staff was very nice. Pool area was nice (especially the tiki bar!!). Free breakfast was very limited and not very good. Good location - close to everything. OK for a night or two, but would stay here for an extended stay."
POSITIVE,"Attractive hotel,nice room,parking,very convenient for Norwich centre ie walking distance.quiet not disturbed by other guests.Did not eat there but conservatory looked nice. Room decor modern and comfortable. Shower not very powerful. No water glasses in room. Traffic noise if opened window. Breakfast charged as extra. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
NEGATIVE,So much for a guaranteed two double beds. Staff confirmed just prior to arrival than at time of check-in was told now more doubles were available. Service is terrible.
POSITIVE,The whole package was good...would certainly stay there again when in the area! Did you find this review helpful? yes no
NEUTRAL,"the hotel is a typical small boutique hotel. the furnishings are worn. The bedding was fairly good The flooring was relativily new. the bath was medium quality. the room was clean the staff was suburb!! Pros: location for where I needed to be Cons: the elevator is a interesting antique however, very slow, it was easier to walk down the 7 floors to the lobby Location: Location is great, just a few blocks from Union Square and fairly close to BART"
POSITIVE,"For the price, you cannot beat this hotel if you are looking for clean, roomy and just a little upscale. Not fancy, but very comfortable. Not far from Hoover Dam or Vegas. it is located in between."
POSITIVE,"quiet Not real good signs for parking, but easy enough to figure out. Location is by a university It was a nice clean hotel. There was no charge for parking. The amount i paid for the room was less than what i would have paid for parking and this way i did not have a 3 hr commute to philly in the early morning"
POSITIVE,"Pros: Close to food and Downtown. Cons: Just OK restaurants, not open late."
POSITIVE,Very nice hotel and great location. Close to watertaxi station and good restaurants.Helpful staff and clean room. Average breakfast
POSITIVE,Nice clean rooms. Great price. Close to freeways. Good size refrigerator in rooms. Clean pool.
POSITIVE,Within easy reach of the Birch Run outlets and 'Bronners' fabulous Christmas store ! We spent several days there and had a great time. Lots of close restaurants and the hotel had a wonderful free breakfast every day! Great selection.
POSITIVE,"For the price it was great - location was exactly where I needed to be. Small rooms but that was expected, quite a funky design, nice lobby. Housekeeping was good - I had a weird shower that didn't drain properly but given my short stay it wasn't a hassle. Free WiFi was excellent, a tiny bit slow during peak periods but really handy. Pros: Lobby and funky design Cons: Weird shower (didn't drain properly) Location: Exactly what I was looking for..."
POSITIVE,"Everything was great, the staff was friendly and always available, so was the hotel shuttle, the room was great and very, very clean. The breakfast food choice is rather limited. Then again, maybe it's a cultural issue due to me being european. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
NEGATIVE,"We had originally booked a 4 night stay at this hotel but checked out after 2.The hotel in general is a bit shabby & the rooms below the standard we have experienced at other hotels of the same rating within this group. However, this is nothing in comparison to the dreadful standards of service & appalling food.We waited an hour between starter & main course. When it finally arrived I had to send it back. It was quite possibly the worst meal I had ever been served in my life.Dried up, bland & tasteless.The sweet was no better.We asked for a manager but were told the restaurant manager was of that evening. We asked for the hotel manager but he or she was also of that evening.We overheard several other diners complaining but there was no one to deal with the complaints & the staff just didn't know what to do.Breakfast was no better.We had to queue for 15 mins to get a table.When breakfast finally arrived it was burnt.I sent it back, the replacement was also burnt.The continental breakfast was all but gone.On the second morning it did not get any better-having decided not to risk cooked breakfast we asked for the porridge that was on the menu-they had run out.Oh well poached eggs perhaps, the eggs were fine, but unfortunately the toast which we had had to make ourselves was cold by the time the eggs eventually arrived. This could be a very nice hotel-fantastic country location with great potential but the staff are not trained & with a few exceptions, not particularly helpful.Over all the hotel lacks management of any kind. When we wrote to complain we received an apology & confirmation that our many complaints were more than justified but were not offered any kind of compensation & the only explanation given was that the hotel had been fully booked & there was also a function on.All the more reason to expect that some kind of management would be on duty. In conclusion, I would advise you to avoid this hotel at all costs, but do not let it put you off Best Western in general.We have stayed at a number of this companies hotels in the past & been extremely impressed.Just read the reviews before you book.Unfortunately we didn't read them before we booked this one."
POSITIVE,"Stayed 2 nights over the weekend while visiting my son at UAF. Comfortable bed, nice front desk staff, good breakfast. Good value."
POSITIVE,"The location was great only 1/2 hr from biltmore and away from the main business section of Ashville. The room was very clean and quiet and the staff was wonderfull. The breakfast was good enough to satisfy anyone, and they had someone making fresh waffles which were great. There is plenty of shopping nearby and restraunts to eat at. Hendersonville itself is quaint with alot of history. We found a wonderfull italion restraunt in nearby horseshoe gap the food was very good and the prices were great. Lake lure is 18miles down the road and is very beautifull, in fact parts of Dirty Dancing were filmed at that location. I would definately stay at this hotel again, in fact we are thinking of going back to see Biltmore at Christmas and will stay here again"
NEUTRAL,Pros: Room was updated and clean. Cons: Front desk clerk was unfriendly.
POSITIVE,This hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. Much nicer inside than it appears on the outside.
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,Very convenient for one night after flight from Australia. Walking distance from Earl's Court Underground.
NEUTRAL,"Rooms are big enough and clean, as other posters have noted. However, my complaint about this hotel is the constant noise level. The walls are not very thick so you hear the guests upstairs and in the rooms next to you walking and opening doors etc very well. We have been unlucky to get a room with a connection door to the next room, which is NOT isolated at all. So we heard them as if they were in our room. Not good if they like TV sessions all night. Outside on your porch are the a/c units. So you are surrounded by 3 units in a distance of max 3 meters. And you might hear the pool pumps, which emmits a constant sound level. Sitting on the porch is great, if you don't need any privacy and do not like quite surrounding. Even though the hotel is nicer then many others, I cannot recommend it again."
NEGATIVE,Beds were uncomfortable and pillows were hard. I would not recommend to anyone. Pros: Free breakfast Cons: Room wasn't very clean. Beds were super uncomfortable! Location: Good location. Close to lots of amenities.
POSITIVE,"Pros: Perfect location, loved the indoor lazy river and jacuzzi. Cons: Parking could be a hassle in the summer, but was fine for the off season."
POSITIVE,"There was a lady at the reception (unfortunately I cannot remember her name; she could talk in Italian as well as far as I could notice) she was a great helper, enourmous help and always smiling, always ready to ask if there is more she could do...She was such a great professional. Earl's Court is not easy to travel to london city center"
POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed myself during the 3 day stay there. After 3 days somewhere else, I again stayed there for another 3 days. Really so good. But I think they should have kinda of given me a discount because I stayed there again for a few days."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the BW Vicksburg for two nights whilst travelling between New Orleans and Memphis by Greyhound Bus. The hotel (motel) was clean, friendly and value for money. The room was cleaned early and available throughout our stay. This was a real asset as we didn't realise how difficult Vicksburg was going to be without a car. We tried to do what we could on foot but this became very difficult in 100+ temperatures. Therefore we were glad to get back to our room, which was always cool and clean. The room had a layout simular to all motel type of residence, but was roomy and comfortable. The facilities thankfully included a fridge and microwave as it was near impossible to to walk to a food outlet because of the freeway positioning and lack of footpaths (side walks). Thankfully only a few hundred metres from the hotel was a very well stocked grocer and a couple of fast food outlets including a Chinnese Restraunt. The motel had a nice indoor pool and provided an adequate continental/hot breakfast, with coffee available 24hrs. The position of the motel could have been better, although obviously was not the fault of the staff who were always helpful, if not somewhat concerned that a couple in their late 50's would contemplate walking Vicksburg in the middle of summer. On reflection the stay was a mistake on our behalf, we should have gone straight to Memphis. We did nevertheless walk to the town centre (nothing special) and on the second day to the Military Park (Visitor Centre). To walk the park itself would be impossible (at any age). Room Tip: As with any motel type premisis, it is usually better to avoid the ground floor."
POSITIVE,The room was comfortable and clean. Most people were there on business. The only problem we had was that the girl at the desk thought we had booked two rooms and didn't want to consider the possibility that we hadn't. She also said they don't accept pets anymore.
POSITIVE,Started to stay for three nights and stayed on for another five nights. Everything was really nice with location & airport shuttle. Staff just great in all areas. Will stay here next time.
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here in the past. The rooms always feel clean and are comfortable. The indoor pool is a good feature if you have kids or swim for exercise. There is also a workout room on the property. We stayed over a weekend for a wedding and housekeeping got to our room just as we got back in the late afternoon to get ready for the wedding. We figured they would of already have been in the room. It was a bit of problem, they were ready to clean while we were getting ready but I did see later that on the desk in the room a card that can be filled out and put on the outside of the door saying when you would like to have your room cleaned during your stay. We could have used that if I hadn't put my newspaper on top of it. Don't look for a continental breakfast, there isn't one. They have a Perkins Restaurant connected to the motel you can enter through the lobby. A convenience on cold days and food available during the day."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Florresville on a visit to see friends. It's a little off the normal tourist beaten track but for our needs it was a perfect base. About a 45 min drive from San Antonio airport, we found the hotel to be clean, comfortable and the staff were extremely friendly. Any request was addressed promptly, with a smileÂ and a ""have a nice day"". All in all, if any travellers are passing through Florresville I would recommend the Best Western without hesitation."
POSITIVE,Good value close to Disneyland. Very clean rooms!!!
NEUTRAL,"The room was a suite, a small conventional Hotel Room with another small room attached. There was a problem with television reception. The bathroom was cramped. Everything was clean, though, and we slept well. We checked out after one night when we had booked two nights. Everyone was friendly, and the breakfast was fine. Parking was difficult as described before."
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay,very quiet. the breakfast was ok and the rooms were fine. good service. there is a very good restaurant beside the hotel."
NEGATIVE,"Wi-fi was very slow, no one would get us a cab, instead they wanted to get us a car service. The room was too hot, the engineer came up to fix it and made it hotter. There were not enough towels when we checked in. Pull out bed was uncomfortable. The service was very poor I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! I would never stay there again, especially for the price and the service."
POSITIVE,We couldn't have picked a better hotel. Loved it! Pros: Front desk staff person made our stay AMAZING! Cons: The TV was outdated.
POSITIVE,Very Comfortable room and an excellent Hotel shuttle to Quebec old town. Receptionist staff very helpful All good
NEGATIVE,"The worse hotel I have ever been ! Lets start from the towels , all ripped and very old . the room at my arrival it wasnt clean at all ... I called reception every single day of my stay in the hotel to complain about the very loud noise that the bathroom from the room above me was making due a pipe that was damage . they didnt do anything about it . Very disappointed"
POSITIVE,Great service with good accessiblility for 86 year-old mother and close proximity to airport with parking.........Love the dining room and cozy bar for relaxation before an early flight the next morning........Superb buffet in early morning for Breakfast........Thanks so much for comfortable stay.............. Heat in room could perhaps be turned on a few hours before guests arrive as room was extremely cold upon arrival and took some time to warm up..............
POSITIVE,"My husband and 3-year old daughter and I spent 5 days at this hotel and we were pleased that we had selected it for our stay. The positives: 1. A great location in White Bear Lake - you can walk to the cute downtown or walk to (and around) the lake. 2. Clean and comfortable rooms. 3. An indoor pool which is a huge plus for anyone with kids. 4. A nice restaurant and rooftop bar. Now, the negatives: 1. After smelling cigarette smoke in our room I contacted the hotel staff and they indicated that they still have a couple of smoking rooms. Apparently they are phasing them out but the smell is quite noticeable if you're located next to one. 2. If you have a room that looks out over the pool you get a fun view but you also get all of the noise from that central area. The walls must be thin because on the majority of evenings we were kept up with people socializing by the pool. 3. The pillows appear to have been selected for people that like to sleep in an elevated position. Be prepared to ask for ones with a shorter loft. All of that above considered we would still select The White Bear Country Inn the next time that we're in the area."
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed our stay at Dry Creek Inn very much. It was the best bargian for quality accommodations we could find in the Healdsburg area. Although our room was not ready when we checked in the nice upgrade to a Tuscany room they offered us because of our wait more than compensated us for the extra wait time. We plan on staying here again our next visit to Healdsburg. We also have recommended Dry Creek Inn to several friends. For value, comfort, amenities, and service, this is the place to stay when visiting Healdsburg."
NEGATIVE,"We had a King Jacuzzi Suite (main building, ground floor) the bedding was dirty (had to call front desk at midnight for new bedding); the room had some bug dark bug in it. The ceiling was flaking and a large long area that had been falling down from a exposed beam, the toilet seal leaked and water leaked onto the floor (had to call at get someone to fix it) They couldn't and needed a plumber who never did show up by the time we left.. The second sink had a huge crack in it. The ceiling tiles above the Jacuzzi had old water stains all over it (from a old flood in room above). The suite stank of old cigarette smoke. Most certainly not a romantic night away! It was 32 hour round trip nightmare. Even the white complimentary robes had hair and someone elseâs makeup still on it! The suite had a small tube TV way on the other side of the living room. And there was only one face cloth in this Jacuzzi suit when we arrived. It took 2 calls and 60 minutes for someone to bring us some more so we could freshen up after our long trip driving there. After notifying the local Health board they had to shut this room down. We did get our money back (on us insisting). They also offered to have us as a guest back at the Inn. But considering they had the nerve to even rent us this room in the first place which obviously looked like it needed to be shut down two years ago, we will most certainly pass from ever going back there again unless there are new owners and major work done to restore this once fine Inn. The grounds need up keep. I used to go to this place every year and the grounds keep showed pride of ownership for sure. With the new owners it appears not any more. Dead bird on the lawn when we arrived, tall weeds all over...No ventilation in the outer hallway that we could tell. We have lost our trust and this Best Western Midland it gives some of the ""credibleâ Best Western a bad name in our opinion. We âdonâtâ recommend this ailing Inn to anyone. We will be going to one of the local B & Bâs from now on. Iâd upload some pictures but I have slow Internet. Really, this all happened and this issue with Best Western Midland and Best Western International will always be left unresolved since we will never go back and they have lost a loyal long time customer. The only good thing that came out of it is that they are now being âmadeâ to fix it."
NEGATIVE,"Stayed in room 210 and woke up with lots of bedbugs on pillows and sheets. Next day, motel sprayed that room PLUS the 2 rooms directly across from it. BEWARE... it ruined my business trip....."
POSITIVE,"my husband travels for business and i am lucky enough to join him at times. on this trip, he choose this hotel for me because of its downtown location. walking beautiful victoria made my day. not having to worry about parking, the free valet service was an added bonus. no continental breakfast but there is a in-house restaurant at good prices. one of my needs is to have a fridge in our room. being a vegetarian, i like to travel with food but when we booked on-line, we could not find a room with a fridge (should have called the hotel to inquire). what an absolute surprise it was when we got to our room, there was a fridge! no king size beds perhaps because the building was built in 1912, but we were comfortable in a cozy room. stayed 2 nights on the 6th floor and only the first night was there loud music until midnight. i questioned the front desk the next morning and was told there must be a bar down the street. well from reading the other reviews, the bar is downstairs! the staff were kind and friendly. they even gave us a great dining experience by offering us a vegetarian restaurant to eat at - rebar. yum, yum. we will come back to this hotel next time!"
NEUTRAL,"This hotel was easy to find, just off the freeway. My room was clean, parking convenient and I felt safe. However there was no place to go for dinner except a hot dog place and a bar. The frig in my room was so noisy and rattling I ended up turning off the power strip. Breakfast was not very good: steam table gravy and biscuits, cold hard boiled eggs [?] you were not allieed to micriwave, pastries you were not alliwed to toast or microwave, sluces of bread wrapped in plastic, fruit cocktail that looked old, watery coffee. At least they had yogurt. My room was also freezing cold. I guess they turned the space heater off during the day to save energy, but it didn't warm up until morning and there were no extra blankets in the room. Nit a good stay b"
POSITIVE,They also had a full breakfast and it was well maintained. Staff freindly and helpful Pros: Good breakfast
POSITIVE,"The silly Best Western website does not do this place justice. Beautiful, charming, historic hotel in a great location. Rooms along the road can be noisy but I sleep through anything so not a problem for me. Nice staff, none of the over-service of much of America."
NEGATIVE,"Pros: The staff were all very nice, helpful, friendly. Cons: My room reeked of smoke/mildew small. I forfeited my last night stay there, even though it was already paid for, because I couldn't take it any more."
NEUTRAL,"Hotels in HB are totally split between the very high end and the low. This property tries to portray itself as in the middle and it is the closest thing there is. But think ""Best Western"", no ""Plus"" or ""Dry Creek"" and you will not be disappointed. Money spent on exterior upgrades do not reflect very outdated rooms. Note also that the location is nowhere near town center."
POSITIVE,"we loved every thing about this hotel, the shuttle to the park was great no waiting. The Hotel was clean, the people who worked there we awesome and very helpful. We will stay there again."
POSITIVE,My family recently stayed at this hotel and loved it!! The breakfast (which is free) was great. The kids had alot of fun in the pool and at the movie theatre. The room was very clean and nicely updated. It was very reasonably priced for having axcess to so many ammenities. We will deffinately be back!
POSITIVE,Great hotel. Rooms were large and quiet. A little hard to find but a great place to stay. Breakfast was outstanding and personnel were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely stay again when we are heading south .
POSITIVE,"It was as good as we expected and we had no complaints. We arrived two days prior to our cruise to Hawaii. They had shuttle service directly to the ship which was very helpful and prompt. Our flight from the east coast was delayed so we arrived too late for the airport shuttle, but it was a short cab ride. We were able to walk to the nearby restaurants and catch the city bus to Balboa Park."
NEGATIVE,"When we arrived at about 7:00 PM, the hotel driveway at the entrance doorway was blocked by a parked car and a motorcycle that was in the middle of the other two lanes. We had to wait a half an hour to check in because ""the summer help had gone back to school."" The service in the upscale restaurant way painfully slow, probably for the same reason. SomeÂ diners left before their meals arrived! There were no elevators to uppers floors of guest rooms."
POSITIVE,"The hotel appears somewhat old but inside the rooms have been renovated and are very nice, clean, and comfortable. Its location is ideal for being downtown with a good restaurant right across the street. Inside parking is a bonus."
POSITIVE,"This is a great hotel at moderate prices in the world of the BandB. We had the Tuscan rooms which have a jet tub and fireplace along with a small patio. The room was clean and well stocked. The shower is very small and in the same room as the toilet. I guess the bathtub took up too much room. They could have done without the tub and made the shower bigger. The front desk staff was attentive and fast. The rooms were quite and there was a sauna and hot tub in the courtyard. We didn't use either it was 100+ every day. It was nice sitting in the private courtyard at night with a fireplace going and a bottle of great Healdsburg area wine. I heard the basic rooms were great too. This is a clean, updated hotel in the center of wine country. We'll be back."
POSITIVE,Cool game room. Nice staff and included breakfast bar makes it well worth the price of admission!
POSITIVE,The hotel staff and very friendly and helpful. Rooms are well equipped and decorated nicely. Pros: Close to the event I was attending. Cons: I had to take a smoking room and I don't smoke.
NEUTRAL,"Let me begin by saying that there is nothing terrible about the Best Western Airport Plaza; it's good, basic lodging. That said, there are plenty of things that could be done to make this a much *nicer* place to stay. My family and I stayed here one night on our way southwards, and the location is very convenient from I-70. The sign marking the entrance road to the property is non-obvious, but you can certainly spot the hotel easily. The hotel is right next to the airport, but is not noisy at all - we weren't bothered by any jet noise. It overlooks a pretty green space that appears to be an old farmstead, complete with old farmhouse. It would be interesting to see this area 50 years ago. The initial impression you get from the exterior pretty much held through our stay: this is an older property in need of some maintenance and updates. The parking ramp is old, very tight, and - on our floor - cluttered with things like an old trailer, rusty grill, trash, beer bottles, and other remnants of past (employee?) parties. The exterior door was broken, and didn't require a card-key to enter. Initial impressions like this don't tend to excite customers. Once inside, you enter the labyrinth: the interior is very confusing. Even though we came in on our floor, we had to go down some stairs and up a different elevator bank in order to get to our hallway. It's easy to get turned around, as it is not laid out very cleanly. The stairways are especially dingy, and the hallways are not very inviting. Our room was basic, but clean and decent-sized. The two double beds were comfortable, and my spouse liked that - as many hotels do now - they wrapped the blankets in sheets. The main issue again is just one of age: the door was somewhat battered, the furniture somewhat older, walls and outlet areas showing wear. The bathroom was somewhat spartan, but clean. I *did* like the nice Delta shower-head that gave a full, pleasing shower. There was no night-light in the bathroom; again, this is a nice (and inexpensive) touch that many hotels miss out on. Breakfast is served starting very early - 4:00 am! - which is great for business travelers. The hot breakfast had eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, cereals, muffins, oatmeal, waffles, and the standard juices and coffees. The food was average; nothing outstanding, nothing horrible. I love good biscuits and gravy, but this was very run-of-the-mill. I didn't notice any provision for express check-out (leaving card-keys in room), so I stopped by the desk to check out. We got a Hotwire rate of $64; with taxes the total was about $80. We found this to be a very good value for basic lodging and food. Just don't expect to be ""wowed!"""
NEGATIVE,"Checked in around 3:00, unpacked and was in the bath when the door opened. I heard the other guests say - this room look like someone is here! They left and when I got out of the shower I asked the front desk what happened - his only excuse was he didn't know I was there - he had just come to work. The hotel is fine, the room was quiet and cool, but I worried every time I left the room that someone else might go into my room. Was planning to stay two nights, but left early. I travel with expensive electronics and can't afford the have it stolen. Best place for breakfast - not the hotel, not the McDonalds, maybe just have coffee and drive to the next town. Port Lavaca is a small seaport town on the Texas coast, north of Corpus Christi. It seems the town never developed, no good restaurants, absolutely no night life and not really a fun place to visit. The major employer in Port Lavaca is a company that makes plastic counter tops. You can do better than this town or hotel."
NEGATIVE,"The wait for check in and check out was very long, only one person working desk. I wanted the front desk to send me a bottle opener so I called the front desk. After about six attempts to get thru, it rang until I got a voice message, I was told I could come to the front desk and use it or go to the lounge and use one. Not impressed, considering theÂ high price I paid to stay there. Also, every other BW I have stayed in included a continental breakfast, this one doesn't and it was the most expensive!"
POSITIVE,"In terms of quality, this Best Western met our expectations. We didn't have any issues during our stay. The only problem I saw at breakfast was that everyone had trouble with the waffle iron. No one was able to get their waffles out without them sticking, including my sons. The staff was quick to try to clean up. I suppose it needed to be sprayed with Pam before each use but there was none available. Other than that, we had a very nice room."
POSITIVE,"It is centrally located, so you can shop and tour fairly easy. The desk staff were not friendly. They appeared annoyed when asked questions. There were never towels at the pool. I had to ask and did not not get them for 40 minutes. The breakfast is good, but the gentleman that puts the breakfast out stares at you. He has a paper plate out wanting tips.Â My kids were uncomfortable with him. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It was good for the money."
POSITIVE,"My husband is in a wheelchair, and we had a handicap room. The room was just ok sizewise, and could have been a bit bigger. There was a metal threshold going into the bathroom which was high and difficult for the wheelchair to go over. With all the negatives out of the way.......the personnel were friendly and exceptionally helpful. The room was clean and tastefully decorated with new looking furniture and linens. There was a good tv program selection. The room service menu also had a good selection and the food was delicious. The king bed was awesome......so comfortable with wonderfully soft bedding and great pillows. The price of the room was very reasonable. The elevator was clean and quick to respond. We feel our stay here was a good experience and will definitely stay here again when we're in this area."
POSITIVE,"This was like the third or fourth time we've stayed there, and we've never had a complaint. The rooms are clean and reasonably priced and the staff is very helpful. Plus, they allow pets!"
POSITIVE,we have stayed at many places and we feel so happy with our stay at this hotel it was clean even with the work been done good moneys worth Pros: the ocean was was grate Cons: can't think of any Location: a beautiful view
NEGATIVE,"This place is a mess except for the lobby(where the pretty pictures are taken. The room was dirty, the exterior was worse. The hotel deserves no more than 2 stars (and that's generous) To spend over $100.00 to stay here is criminal. I would have been better off at the motel 6! The noise in the hallway, and the scream of the water pipes was awful. The beds had messy covers, which I am unable to call blankets. The t.v. was about 20 years old, and the scratched tagging on the entrance door was just more negligent mess. Don't waste your hard earned $ here. Shame on best western! Room Tip: might as well stay at motel 6, it's probably better. The place is a mess, except the lobby. I gu..."
POSITIVE,"The hotel location, condition, and service were all decent and fine. The clerks were very flexible in regards to late check-ins. The room was clean, neat, and of good size (double queens). Continental breakfast was simple but free, like any Best Western. Bathrooms were clean and functional. It's in a residential area, near food and groceries. My onlyÂ critique is the parking. While there is ample parking, the layout of the lot is cramped and challenging for bigger cars."
POSITIVE,It was convceniently located and was resonably priced. The only thing I did not like what the load humming noise of your circulating pump for keeping hot water available at all times. Do you have timers to shut them off during the late night into the the early morning hours. We stayed in room #255.
POSITIVE,From the day we arrived check in went smoothly and quickly and the staff was very friendly and welcoming!! The room was nicely updated and very cozy!! My son loved the pool and their complimentary breakfast was good!! We originally had booked for one night but the next morning we booked for an extra night and I didnt have to change rooms!! We reallyÂ enjoyed our stay and would definetly book this hotel again!!
NEUTRAL,"The location was great, right in the middle of i-drive. Very close to great shopping, attractions and food. Also easy to move around without a car and geared toward tourists. The room and bed was comfortable, great pillows. I would stay again. My only complaints would be that some of the sockets in my room did not work and the building is old, could do with some updating."
POSITIVE,The stay at Best Western was great. The location of hotel was very convenient for freeway access. The beds were very comfortable. Will stay there again.
POSITIVE,We were suprised that the room was a converted one bedroom apartment. We would definately stay here again. Good value for the price. Nice full service restaurant.
POSITIVE,Clean no-smoking rooms.
POSITIVE,"This hotel is good bed, good location. overall rate is 3.5/5 Sometime wireless connection is busy and noise from high way. overall rate is 3.5/5"
POSITIVE,"Modern equipment, very clean and nice rooms, free WiFi, the bus shuttle to downtown starts in front of the hotel... We felt very comfortable in the room and in the hotel. The internet connection was not possible all the time (router problems)"
NEGATIVE,"This is a really bad choice when staying in southwest Florida. Stay somewhere else -- paid $90 for two queen beds, refrigerator, and microwave. LED lights in the entire room and dingy gray walls. Front desk staff rude - when told them we wanted to move our room or cancel - they said no. Recently remodeled beds extremely soft -- where you fall off the ledge. Six miles from the beaches with the closest restaurant a 24 hour McDonald's at a gas station. Really really bad. Room Tip: Don't stay here"
POSITIVE,beautiful room friendly accomidating staff. would stay again and would refer my friends.went to visit grandchildren. They had no problem with letting them stay with me or use the pool. Pool was very clean. We really enjoyed our stay. Morning breakfast was one of the better ones. Located right off the highway. Plenty of shopping and fine restaurants. Will definatly stay again when I return to visit. Price was great considering how nice everything was.
POSITIVE,A good place to stay at a reasonable price.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here foe an extended weekend. Great value, loved the in room fridge and microwave! Thought it was nice that they have a pack of popcorn and a bag of cookies in the room! I only had 2 minor complaints, 1 they only emptied 1 of the two trash cans after our first night (not normally an issue, but I had a baby with me), 2 the air temp around the pool was a little colder than I would like. But aside from those 2 issues everything was great!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel is right off of I95. It's a great halfway stop m Philadelphia to Myrtle Beach. Not as nice as Holiday Inn, but it was well worth the $53 savings. Room was decent; People were nice; Continental breakfast was not that good, but it was not a big deal. There are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast if you need more. I'd recommend it for anyone [?] looking for a decent overnight stop at a very good price."
NEUTRAL,"Nothing! It smelled and crepy pepole around the hotel. Adult nude club just around the parking,for the pepole that looks for it, you can miss the pink neon sign and the pepole in and out. Not for a family!!!"
POSITIVE,"My husband and I also had a week-end getaway in Gatlinburg the week before Christmas. I booked at the Zoder Inn due to the good reviews, price and rooms over a mountin stream. We really enjoyed our stay. The beds were comfortable and the sound of the stream was very relaxing. The staff (2 very nice young men) went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Everyone else in Gatlinburg seemed tired and not so glad to see another tourist but not these guys. We will definately return to the Zoder Inn."
NEGATIVE,It smelled like mold and when you got up in the morning and went outside it smelled like raw sewage. I will NEVER stay there again
POSITIVE,"gym,hot tub, internet connection free,RandR"
NEUTRAL,"Spent one night here on our way to Death Valley. Decent motel in the quaint city of Lone Pine. Clean room, pleasant staff, comfortable beds. My only compliant would be the small, small shower. I'm 6'2 and the ceiling of the shower was just a few inches above my head. Overall probably one of the nicer motels in the area. Enjoyed the town itself...small but pretty much has a least one of every store you could need for your stay."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for two nights at the end of our Seattle trip (we stayed with friends for the first half). It was great! The room was big enough for the two of us, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious, as well as restocked each day. I liked the old charm of this historic building. The free breakfast was basic, but was plenty for us (cereal, fruit, and waffles, if you wanted). Since we did the Underground Tour on our first day in Seattle, we were acquainted with the Pioneer Square area, and getting around was not a problem. During our stay at the Best Western, we walked to Columbia Tower, Seattle Aquarium, and Pike Place. We managed to take the bus to the Space Needle without issue as well - the bus stop is a block away. We took a taxi back from the Space Needle ($8-9 with tip), and noticed the fare to SeaTac was $32. Instead, we took the light rail from the Pioneer Square Station to SeaTac, which is three blocks (albeit uphill) from the hotel for a cheeeeeeeap $2.75. Just be sure to allow 40 minutes or so for the ride if you choose the light rail. Also, if you're looking for a great sandwich, my husband and I highly recommend Delicatus, which is a block up from the hotel on 1st Ave. I am still fantasizing about their Pav Diablo sandwich, yum. If you sleep late or want a second breakfast, Planet Java is one block over from the hotel on South Washington - we had a decent brunch there, eggs, turkey sausage and waffles. Nothing extraordinary, but tasty and filling. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, pleasant staff, very clean, great location. Room Tip: We had an interior room on the fourth floor - no view, but it was incredibly quiet."
NEGATIVE,"We tavel to dartmouth a couple of times a year for the IWK hospital and we thought we would try this hotel as it was new. we figured new means clean! Unfortunatly we were wrong. the Hotel was fine, the staff was excellent but the pool! The people in our party who swam got a rash on their skin, the people who did not swin were fine. when we arrived home from our trip we went to our local physician and even he told us the rash was due to a ""dirty pool"". the rash lasted over a week and only went away with penicilin. WOW- I travel alot and that is the first time i have ever seen something like this. I did call the Hotel to inform them of the issue so they could resolve it before any other guests got sick. I thought i would at least get some kind of apology but i guess i was mistaken. The manager informed me that the ""numbers"" in the pool for that weekend were fine and that no other gust had called about a rash!! I guess that is why the managers get paid the big bucks; so they can tell the customer they are wrong."
NEUTRAL,"decent bed, room was a bit rought around the edges, pool not open, ceiling tiles loose, closet needed work, maids didnt abide by ""privacy please"" they changed towels etc, but either didnt see it or ignored it."
POSITIVE,Great rate and service. Pros: Friendly front desk service and manner.
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel for 2 nights: service is excellent, very knowledgeable personnel, all their recommendations for us as tourists were very valuable. Our first room was on the ground floor and it was too noisy for us we asked for another room and it was excellent on the 1st floor. For us from Europe breakfast was a bit poor, but they are working on making changes and making it better according to the information from the manager. We loved our stay and the people at the front desk made our days."
NEGATIVE,"We are Platinum Best Western members, with many points, so we decided to return to the Best Western Carolinian for the week of Easter. We arrive on Wednesday 4-4-2012 and stayed until 4-8-2012. When we checked in at around 3:00 we asked for a possible room upgrade and were told that this week they were booked solid. We had reserved and received confirmation for a 2 Queen ocean front room with a kitchenette. The room given to us was 1004 in the old building. It was very old looking, with an old TV set and worn down furniture. There was no kitchenette, we called downstairs and the lady that answer told us she did not have our reservation as one with a kitchenette. We told her that we could go down and show it to them since we had it in our phones. She transferred us to the manager and he gave us the room next door 1003, which was a big change! Had updated flat screen tv and a nice new shower and also the famous kitchenette. My guess is that since we were using points they were saving this ""nicer"" room for their paying weekend customers...The room did not have towels or a shower curtain, so I went downstairs and was promptly given towels and a shower curtain to arrange myself as they seem to busy to send anyone to help me. Parking is like a block away and we did not need to use the valet, we did use the bellboy for our luggage. We were not given breakfast tickets and the next day my husband went and asked, the lady at the front desk told him that he really should not get them because of some summer rate thing?? my husband told her it was posted in the Best Western site. She finally gave him the tickets, we had breakfast at the Magnolia Restaurant across the street. The weather was kind of cool, so luckily we were able to use the indoor pool at the Anderson Resort right next door. The lazy river at the Best Western was to say it nicely filthy! I would not let my son swim there! Housekeeping service was non-existent, I had to call the front several times each day and finally hunt down the maid in my floor to ask her to clean my room everyday. Management did not seem to care, as I waited to check out several customers were complaining about issues like not getting housekeeping and clean towels. Also during our trip a sewer line or some plumbing line busted and there was a horrible odor from Wednesday until sometime Thursday. One of the elevators was broken constantly, checking out was a bit of a pain because again on Sunday only one elevator was working and many people were checking out, also all the staff of the hotel monopolizes the elevator that is actually working, which is ridiculous! I would not stay here nor would I recommend this hotel for a nice vacation, there are many other nice places to stay in Myrtle Beach, I am not sure how they are getting the reviews they seem to be getting. I have also sent my comments to the Best Western Corporate offices."
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel. Well tended grounds and private balconies for each room. Lobby nice and free, hot breakfast a nice touch. Room well equipped and includes coffeemaker (the free coffee in lobby all day)and refrigerator. Shower head allowed reasonable water flow but shower curtain too short and barely met tub side. Five pillows on bed but all were identical, hard foam rubber. Nicelobby bar that has pool table. Main problem was that doors required slamming to shut so there was lots of noise in hallway. ... Pros: Excellent free hot breakfast. Private balcony for each room. Refrigerator in room. Good shower head. Cons: Steel doors mean loud slamming all day. Shower curtain too short. No pillow selection."
POSITIVE,"Very convenient amenities for business or just checking up on e-mails, printing boarding passes. Super staff."
NEUTRAL,"We booked on their website, the least expensive room with two twin beds, but this may not exist, because we were upgraded when we arrived to two doubles. Chose the hotel for its location near the Art Museum and Pikeâs Market (6-8 blocks). Overall, itâs nicely decorated in keeping with the historic neighborhood, but our room was very small. Not enough floor space to even put up the luggage rack or ironing board. The furniture was decent quality, if a bit too large for the space. The bathroom counter was 3/4ths occupied by coffee maker, ice bucket and glasses. Our room card key was temperamental, and changing keys didnât help. A phone in the hallway to contact the front desk was inoperative. We slept very well, no noise from other guests, and the raised highway nearby sounded like ocean surf, not disturbing. The continental breakfast is very generous, with an excellent waffle maker. The free parking garage, however, is treacherous, with lanes so narrow that turning its blind corners could mean running head-on into a car in the opposite direction. Descending on one corner I had to pull to the side, stop, then back up to return to the lane in order to avoid a collision. If youâve got a larger car, park somewhere else! Spaces are first-come-first-serve anyway, and we went up 5 floors before finding a spot. The historic neighborhood felt safe, although since it was cold weather there may have been fewer street people around. If youâre willing to put up with a few quirks in an older building, this is a good location for seeing downtown Seattle. You donât need to walk steeply uphill to access the market and shops overlooking the waterfront. Itâs a half dozen blocks from an Amtrak station and also near the ferries."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and I keep going back. The service is outstanding. Even though my colleague and I got into town early for an afternoon meeting, we were allowed to check into our rooms early (which allowed us to work through the afternoon worry free). The rooms are comfortable (including the bed) and have all of the amenities you need (much more occomodating than the Vegas hotels), and are very clean and sanitized (even the TV remote has a sanitary cover). It's location is perfect for me since my meetings are all in the White Settlement area, AND, there are all kinds of great eating establishements close by. It also has a continental breakfast every morning starting at 0630. Everybody may not like it, but it's definately my kind of place to stay when I'm away from home."
POSITIVE,From the warm welcome on arrival to the comfortable beds - this was a great stay. This is what a travellers hotel should be. Nothing we requested was too much to ask for...from a ground fllor room to advice on what restuarants where available in town. The pool was under renovation when we where there. A very quiet nights sleep And a suitable breakfast in the morning. I will be staying at this place again
POSITIVE,This hotel is wonderful. No complaints everything was great. We decided to stay in the tall tower and we had a perfect view of the ocean. Love this hotel.
NEGATIVE,Pros: Nothing.
POSITIVE,"After calling several sold-out hotels I booked a room here. The place was a little dated, but AC was new and quiet. Rooms were clean, but not spectacular. Not a bad place to stay overall. Breakfast was great!"
POSITIVE,"Great location to the zoo, tram depot, Seaport Village, and the waterfront. Incredibly friendly staff. For the price, surpassed expectations. Very comfy bed and pillows."
POSITIVE,Booked this hotel for a 5 night get-away. We could not have made a better choice. We had an oceanfront 2 bedroom suite on the 5th floor. It had everything we needed. The views were fantastic. The staff was so friendly and did everything right to make our stay enjoyable. We plan to return to MB as much as we can and this is the hotel we will be booking each time. Room Tip: Ask for 33 series room in Tower 1 as they the best view.
POSITIVE,"We were pleased to find a hotel of this quality in the very small town of Cascade Locks. The location was great being just several miles from the Sternwheeler dock, Bonneville Dam, and the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center. We enjoyed a spacious room with a wonderful view at the NE corner of one of the upper floors - a large L-shaped room with large windows on two sides looking over and up the Columbia River. The train passes adjacent to the hotel - the sound of an occassional train was not objectionable(another reason to take an upper level room). Pros: Free breakfast"
POSITIVE,"The suite on the ground floor was ideal for my mother using a walker - spacious and easy to manouever around the room. It felt very safe for her to be in the room. The room was very comfortable, clean and relaxing. Bathroom was safe and clean. The kitchenette was very adequate and the sitting room was spacious too. The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful. The hotel was very accommodating with extending our stay. Overall we had a great stay and would have no hesitation in returning to the hotel. Room Tip: Discuss your needs with the staff for options"
POSITIVE,"The staff was fantastic. My son had sprained his ankle earlier in the day and the staff moved us to a ground floor room without asking. This made it possible for him walk to the pool and spend time with his cousins, even if it was not in the pool. Pros: The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond being helpful."
POSITIVE,"I've traveled a lo--from 5 star European palaces to sandy tents in the Sahara desert-- so I'm accustom to a variety of accommodations. The Best Western on Wolf Rd. hotel room was clean, the beds were comfortable, the staff was polite, the hot breatfast was served with a smile. I booked through hotels.com so the rate was great. I'd stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed for an entire week at the Best Western Brentwood, TN, and I truly have never had such a wonderful hotel experience. The room accommodations were clean, attractive and comfortable. Breakfast was great. The staff at this location were exceptional. They all went out of their way to make my visit a good one. I can not say enough about about Tammy and and the staff there."
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the room, the breakfast buffet and the other amenities offered at this hotel. I will definitely stay again for business or bring my family back when traveling. The location was perfect for business (very close to LSU.) The price for the room was remarkable considering the full suite with kitchen and lots of living space. I had everything IÂ needed."
POSITIVE,the room was nice bathroom small beds were very commfy will go back again pool was little cold but oh well overall very nice for the price
POSITIVE,"I just wanted a place to stay for one evening, close enough to easily drive into Boston and less expensive than actually staying IN Boston. This hotel met all of my needs. It's about a 20 minute drive from Boston without using the toll roads. The room (Standard Queen) had a small balcony which was nice, the bathroom was a little cramped, but not really a problem at all. The wifi worked after a quick call to the front desk (why don't they give that to you when you check in?). Breakfast was adequate, about what you'd expect, cereal, fruit, yogurt, and a waffle maker. I would have loved covered parking but that's not a big deal. When I make this trip again I will probably stay at the Best Western Waltham again."
POSITIVE,"I was very impressed with the room. Large, beautiful wood floors, nice pine furniture, interesting artwork, and very comfortable beds with nice bedding."
POSITIVE,"In the last couple of weeks have had the pleasure of staying at the Westerly Hotel & Convention Centre in Courtenay BC. 3 separate times. Each time the front desk staff where very quick to check me in and upon arriving in the room found it to be very clean with one of the lamps on and music playing softly. Really enjoyed these small touches. Have ordered room service and it was very prompt, correct, and hot. Love the Westerly Hotel & Convention Centre and would highly recommend it to friends, family, and co-workers. Room Tip: rooms in the new wing are beautiful and get a pillowtop queen bed they are so comfy."
POSITIVE,"The front desk person was very polite and friendly,along with cleaning personal. I will recommend this inn to all my friends."
NEUTRAL,"The rooms themselves were very clean and modern with new furniture and bathroom fixtures. Large flat screen TV and comfortable beds. The bathroom was huge and very clean. The lobby area was nice, but no elevator. Made getting our bags to the second floor kind of pain. The walls were thin and you could hear any movement or conversation in the hall as if they were in the room with you. Breakfast was ok with waffles, eggs, sausage, fruit, cereal, etc. Staff could have been more friendly. Had to call to the desk to get the wi-fi code. Also at checkout I asked for a receipt and was told I should have received an email when I booked. Staff didn't seem eager to help. Had an outdoor pool which was not in use as we were there in March. If you need a place to sleep for the night, this place will work."
NEGATIVE,"Location of hotel was in what it seems in an unsafe area, pool was dirty, handle on one of the doors that let to the backstairs was broken. The breakfast menu extremely poor, not enough toasters or waffle makers, tables and chairs. Only one staff person for breakfast hours which is not enough for the amount of people that eat at that time. Pros: Nothing. Cons: Just about all."
POSITIVE,"This was our second BW Plus on our trip and it too was a great experience. I had prepaid for this stay using the Best Western site, and got a great rate. Rooms were very nice and seemed very new. When we checked in, we found out that because we're members of the rewards program, we're entitled to drinks (two free drinks per adult) and build your own nachos. We took them back to our room, as our son was underage and kids are not allowed in the serving room. The hotel is not close to downtown, but if you need a good place to stay off of the interstate, this is the place. Another bonus, the swimming pool water temp. was like a bathtub. The staff at the front desk were as friendly as any front desk staff you might find."
POSITIVE,"Room was clean, the bed comfortable, a good hot breakfast buffet, and the staff excellent in all regards. A good value and a perfect location for our needs. Have stayed here many times over the years and have never been disappointed."
POSITIVE,"Went there after a day at Legoland, and were wondering what to expect from a hotel in Auburndale :-) But what a pleasant surprise! The hotel is located 15 minutes from Legoland. The lobby is open, nice and clean, and has an aquarium that caught the attention of our kids aged 2 and 4. We were welcomed in a very hospitable way. Our room #107 was next to the reception, on the ground floor. It was spacious and clean, with two large beds and a working table with a Dell computer! The bathroom was large and clean, and had a coffee maker! The wifi worked without problems. Breakfast was simple, but we didn't miss anything. The waitress was as helpful as any mother, so we felt most welcome. We recommend this hotel to anyone who is in the area, especially those visiting Legoland Florida. The price was only 93 USD incl taxes and continental breakfast!"
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, nice rooms, etc. Pros: Very clean and friendly."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at the Hill House over the years, but recent changes have made our trips more comfortable and pleasurable. The staff is accommodating, the rooms are clean, comfortable and they also provide breakfast. The Hill House is almost directly accross from the Amtrak station, downtown and various restaurants all within walking distance. I recommend the Hill House whenever you are in Bakersfield. Room Tip: Ask for room downstairs as there are no elevators"
NEUTRAL,"Plenty of room, comfy beds. Rooms were not clean. Found food on floor and a sticky substance on nightstand. The entire hotel is outdated."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was busy, but quiet. Rooms were clean. Continental breakfast was just what we needed to start the day, there was always plenty and always fresh. The front desk staff were always polite and very helpful. Without them we would never have found our way around Pheonix."
POSITIVE,"We stayed in the Tuscon Room. The fireplace and location of the hotel made the stay pleasant. However, the breakfast was very disappointing. They did have a prepared mix for make your own waffles and the rest of the offerings were dry goods:cereal and breads. The staff was friendly. For the price it is an excellent value. Room Tip: Get the Tuscun Room with fireplace."
NEGATIVE,"Vomit was continually backing up into our tub . Very disgusting. They did little to fix it even after 3 calls to get someone to clean it. They are friendly, but that ruined our stay. Liked: Location, Food Disliked: Rooms, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here one night on a visit to Family in Humble, Texas last year and the hotel is very nice, clean rooms and located in a safe area full of different dining options. Definitely would recommend this hotel and would stay again if needed in this area."
POSITIVE,I like that the staff were very pleasant and the Inn was very clean especially my room. I had a really good experience staying at the Inn. I would definitely stay there again.
POSITIVE,"I was pleased with my stay at this hotel. While looking for a value hotel on this website I noted that this particular hotel had better customer ratings than other similarly priced ones. The hotel looked a little ""shady"" on the outside (I believe it is due to the white window treatments that make the building appear unattractive), however, once inside,Â the building was decorated beautifully and very clean. Staff was very friendly and the room was comparable to a hampton inn/courtyard marriott/holiday inn hotel room. Location was two blocks from the red line and near grocery stores/dining. Excellent place to stay, will be coming back next year :)"
NEUTRAL,"I have to say that my check-in was kinda weird. I arrived late (about 2300h) to a crying baby on the counter and a desk clerk who was largely unaware of my arrival. She then could not find my reservation (made through hotels.com) but after 20 minutes and a few phone calls she allowed me in to my room. All accommodations were OK, just allow some extra time for check-in."
POSITIVE,If you are going to Chicago and you want location without price.... this is the hotel for you. Not a lot of frills but the rooms are clean and quite.
POSITIVE,"We stayed in the Dry Creek Inn Tuscany Suites for one night over New Year's with a Travelzoo Special deal. The room was spacious, comfortable and so romantic--we had a wonderful time. The Jacuzzi tub was delightful, the king bed to die for and the breakfast great. Everyone was friendly and upbeat--we will be back!!! It was a perfect getaway--and so cool at a great price!!!"
POSITIVE,Easy access from the highway. Clean and renovated rooms. Excellent breakfast. Pros: Good breakfast. Cons: Towel bar was very loose. Location: Not far from Tampa and other locations.
POSITIVE,"The best thing about our stay were the facilities provided - guest laundry, pool, spa, and free bike hire. The hotel offered free bike hire for its guests, but only had about 6 bikes to offer. We were unable to hire bikes the first day we were there as they had all been taken out. I think that they should increase the number of hire bikes they have available, so as not to create the situation where they're offering a service but can't actually supply it."
POSITIVE,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had everything we needed and the staff was most helpful. Loved the green surroundings.
POSITIVE,"Unlike many other hotels in the Cedar Point area, this one was extremely clean, well maintained, and a great deal for me and my traveling companion. We had full access not not only the hotel therapy pool but also the two pools and one spa of the establishment next door. The continental breakfast was filling, and the desk clerk was very friendly. Recommended!"
POSITIVE,"Great staff, perfect location!"
NEUTRAL,"Nothing special and almost a little too pricey for what you get but I find Moncton very overpriced for the value and quality of the hotels in the city. The property and room were clean but very spartan and utilitarian. One of the new ""cookie cutter"" BW designs. Good breakfast, nice small pool. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would rate this a 3.5 out of 5, but Tripadvisor does not give that option so I fall to a 3 - just an average property."
POSITIVE,"Really nice room that had obviously been newly painted, new bedding, etc. I had requested not to be on the first floor and that was accommodated. I had also requested a room facing the ocean and that was not. WHY we were put in a ""handicapped"" room I do not know - other than the fact that I am over 55 so I got the discount for that. Our room faced the pool and we had a horrible night's sleep with all the noise down at the pool area. Which is WHY I requested a room facing the ocean. It is, after all, a vacation town so you expect people to be up all hours of the night. I would stay there again, but be emphatic about where my room is. They were NOT full so there is no reason they could not honor our request. Loved the free WiFi and the free breakfast buffet across the street."
NEUTRAL,The room was not vacum cleaned Check in ok
POSITIVE,"This was the first place we stayed during our tour of New England. We chose it based on location - and the reviews we've read. We were surely not disappointed. The hotel looks like a motel from the outside (at least as I picture them), but there is much more to it than that. The service is great, ranging from the greetings when we arrived, information on shopping and restaurants and the complimentary breakfast. We have booked a suite (2 Queens and a separate sitting room, separate area with sink, fridge and a microwave) which was perfect and spotlessly clean. The dÃ©cor is a bit to the dark side, but OK and functioning. The sleep quality is excellent - really great when trying to get rid of jet lag in one night. There were two big flat-screen TV's as well, which was really nice. The breakfast is fine with lots of cereals, bagels, toast, Danish and even a waffle maker. Coffee was hot, well-brewed and plentiful. One minus was though, that the breakfast room is too small when a lot of people use it, as the case was during Columbus day weekend - but we managed by squeezing us together and taking a bagel and coffee standing up. As we apparently arrived in the middle of a autumn heat wave, we could even use the outdoor pool, which really was nice - great for the kids, as the depth ranged from 2"" to 4"". The surroundings were very well kept and this all in gives you the impression that this place is run with care and pride. If we ever get back to New England, we'll definitely stay here again. Tip section: The harbour and many attractions, as well as a plethora of restaurants and shops are within walking distance, which makes the location really good. For a supermarket you'll have to go back and under the highway, where the is a large Stop and Shop. Just across Court Street there is a liquor store, which is amazingly well stocked. Room Tip: The suites are really nice, but closer to the road. The traffic there is though not bad."
POSITIVE,"my sister and i have stayed at this best western a few times now and it just gets better verry friendly and clean,they went out of thier way to make us a meal even when the resterant was closed.would recoment this hotel in seattle"
NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't stay at this hotel if someone was holding a gun to my head!! First of all, we booked this room last minute b/c it was ""downtown"" and the rate was $99. Upon check-in, we were informed that we had to pay $10 to park. We had no choice since there is virtually no parking along the street. The underground parking is tiny and horrible! All the spaces were full, so the attendant had to park us in the disabled parking space (without a placard). After I checked in, I went upstairs to the room only to find a man and woman leaving out of the same room! I went back downstairs and demanded they give me a different room. The clerk changed my room to 205. On my way back upstairs, some random guy with tattoos on his head asked me if he can hide out in my room!!! He followed me halfway to my room telling me that he was running from the police and asking for shelter!! WTF?? I also couldn't sleep because I heard EVERYTHING going on in the next room!! I ended up leaving the same night I checked in...cutting my losses. When I returned home and checked my bank account, I found that I had been charged twice for one nights stay. One charge for the room+tax and one charge for the room+tax and parking. I called the hotel to let them know. The same clerk answered and denied the mistake. I spoke with a manger ""Tony"" who said he will ""check into it"" and call me back. As of this review, I am still waiting for the call back. I eneded up filing a claim with my bank. DANGER!!!!!PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!!!!"
NEUTRAL,It is overall OK. But the hotel is in a shady area.
NEGATIVE,"We booked this hotel through an online cheap hotels site where they don't tell you what you've booked until after you've paid. We paid very little for the room and that is about what it was worth. We were in town for a wedding and the location was what we wanted - near the highways. This is a very shabby, very worn motel in the midst of a renovation (thank goodness). It is under staffed, although the staff do seem to be trying. In our room the door did not fit correctly in the door jam, so that someone could actually look into our room through the space left if they wanted to. The carpet was worn and torn in places The room smelled like it had once been a smoking room. The drain in the tub was broken. There was a lot of noise from the traffic in the hallway. One nice surprise was how comfy the bed was. The breakfast area is wretched - overcrowded, worn out and literally right in the middle of the lobby with no tables and very little seating. Very awkward. A couple of men came out to the breakfast area in their pyjama bottoms and shirtless and it about matched the atmosphere of the place. It would be better if they didn't offer breakfast than to have it where it is and of the quality offered. Had I known what I was booking ahead of time I would not have chosen it, even for what I paid."
POSITIVE,"While an old motel, it was clean, quiet and the staff was very helpful. It is within walking distance to Canal Park, where there are many restaurants and attractions."
POSITIVE,"This is a great hotel for travelers on a budget. We paid $70/night through Hotwire and it is a 2.5 star hotel. The rooms are very clean, the people are very nice. Very safe - no low class hotel guests here. Breakfast was also great, especially for free. Also, about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown. The only downsides of our stay were: 1) the toilet frequently ran, just requiring us to adjust the handle 2) all outdoor doors. but safe. i prefer indoor doors. 3) Low quality blankets In summary, if you are on a budget, this is a great place to stay. If you can splurge 100-120/night then priceline a nicer hotel in downtown."
POSITIVE,"Not luxury, but the price was very good for the accommodations. It was easy to access and they had availability despite it being a very busy football weekend. The staff was helpful. Pros: They could accommodate us despite it being a very busy weekend. Cons: Linens out of date."
POSITIVE,stayed here after getting a recommendation from a friend. turned out to be a good choice.the rate was good . over good value for $$$ Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet
POSITIVE,"Can't find a better location for downtown Palm Springs. The pool was nice and staff were very friendly. Breakfest was fantastic. Rooms are nice, although a little dark. However very clean and comfy beds."
POSITIVE,I was satisfied with this hotel. Room was clean. Fridge & microwave. Wish there had been fresh fruit with the continental breakfast.
POSITIVE,"We have had to stay in this area several times in the past 6 months and have tried many hotels. The search for a place we'd like to stay again is over! We loved this hotel, the location, the room was clean and the breakfast is awesome! Best value by far compared to the other hotels we've stayed in. We'll be back for sure!â Liked: Rooms, Value"
POSITIVE,We were lucky to be upgraded (not sure why) and our room was beautiful. It was our first anniversary and it could not have been nicer. Wish we could have stayed for a week. We will be back for sure. Thank you for making our first anniversary and very special one.
POSITIVE,"Great staff & relaxing stay, room's were comfortable & hot breakfast very good so many item's to choose from. Price was very reasonable , will be back again. Room Tip: King size bed are great."
POSITIVE,"These other reviews seem to be outdated. Hotel was nice and seemed newly remodeled. Friendly staff, nice restraunt and lounge in the hotel. Rooms were nice and clean, far exceeding the Days Inn which we originally booked, but moved over to the Best Western after we found blood stains and cock roaches in the Days Inn. This Best Western is as nice as any other I've ever stayed at, and after staying there for 5 days, I have no complaints. A+ Especially for South Enid!"
POSITIVE,"Everyone we dealt with at the hotel were pleasant and helpful. The room was very clean and bigger than I expected. The beds were small, but comfortable. Breakfast was good and fully stocked right up until 9:30, which is the end of breakfast service. There are self-serve waffle makers and an assortment of other breakfast foods. I would definitely recommendÂ the hotel and we will more than likely go back!"
POSITIVE,"Nice comfortable hotel. Dog and kid friendly. Pool had a water slide, and was indoors along with a not so hot hot tub. Walls seemed a little thin, could hear the neighbors. But the bed was comfortable."
NEUTRAL,With nearby access to BART and MUNI this hotel served as a great hub for my recent San Francisco trip. Not the best part of town but the rooms were spacious.
POSITIVE,Location was very good for price and rooms were very clean and recently renovated. Room was micro-small with very little room to even turn around for two people. Breakfast had pretty good selection but the quality was quite poor.
POSITIVE,"Doing construction work in Charlottetown, two month stay, great location within walking distance of great food and beverage, very clean, comfortatable, with excelllant staff, especially the front counter.....definately recommend staying there."
POSITIVE,"Visiting Zion park, the Best Western Hotel in Springdale, Utah has good accomodation for a fair price. lacking compared to many other hotels in the same area is breakfast facility."
NEUTRAL,"I can make this review short by saying I totally agree with sinatralover in canada who said , ""Grounds and Pool were Nice but Rooms Disappointing"". The rooms really felt like an old Motel 6 with a better bed and linens. Bed seemed comfortable but we both woke up with back aches and didn't sleep well due to the noise of the parking lot and people walking by our window at all hours. We got in late and went to get something from the machines in the locked vending room but the machines would not take the money.The front desk clerk apologized and said they had nothing to do with them. That is why it is nice to have something of a snack bar at the front desk. Their food and beverage service options, during the hours they were open, seemed nice and the location couldn't be better for shopping. I don't think I would stay here again because for the money the room was just too small, depressing and motelish."
POSITIVE,"My friend and I found the Holiday Inn on New Smyrna Beach to be a delightful place to stay for a few days of just ""hanging out"". We were quite impressed with the accommodations and with the full view of the beach! The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating in what ever way you needed their help. We were quite pleased with our stay all theÂ way around!"
POSITIVE,We had a great time! Our room worked for our size group. We loved the pool and the Beach. Children eat free so they both enjoyed the children's menu. The View was great. Had good parking and fast way to get to the Beach without waiting inline to buy a pass on a busy Memorial Weekend! I would do it again.
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Howe Best Western Plus one night for a family funeral. The comfortable beds, impeccably clean, and a comfortable table/chairs and an easy chair were quite welcome. We did not venture into the enclosed pool area, but those that came out of that area seemed very happy, indeed. Breakfast included the usual cereal, muffins, and pastries along with scrambled eggs, biscuits, bagles, and sausage. There was a do-it-yourself waffle maker we did not try. I would recommend this anyone for it's easy access from the 80/90 toll road in North Central Indiana/South Central Michigan."
POSITIVE,"Great outdoor pool and jacuzzi area with an overall beautiful setting. The rooms was somewhat small, but it was clean and had everything we needed. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. The front desk was nice and helpful. The Zion shuttle stop is just steps away, and there are several nearby restaurants. Room Tip: Be sure to eat at the Whiptail Grill. It is a great place to eat...the food is exceptional and the..."
POSITIVE,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Palm Desert Resort. It is perfect size of a resort with beautiful, mature trees and excellent landscaping and maintenance of the grounds. Our room overlooked the pool and we had our own balcony...idyllic!Our room was a good size, well appointed, our bed was very comfortable and we felt very content there. All staff were superb and the hot breakfast every morning was a real treat and was a welcome beginning to our day. We stayed for 8 nights and would highly recommend it. We enjoyed the fact that we were not right in Palm Springs and discovered some great restaurants and grocery stores close by.Pool area with hot tub... wonderful.We'll be back!"
POSITIVE,"Overall I'd say we were pleased. The customer service was pretty good and the room was clean and quaint. We liked the little things...free computer access and printer in lobby, room service and pool bar."
POSITIVE,"Very friendly service as one might expect from a five star hotel. Breakfast was great as well. Book early, we booked same day at 5:00 pm and they had only one room left open."
NEGATIVE,"It is a nice hotel for the price. great rooms, good breakfast, great amenities : internet, laundromat. one thing the jacuzzy is not very clean and would need a refreshing coat of paint. aside from that, a great stay!!!! very friendly staff... and the bikes are a great amenity! Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet free bikes"
POSITIVE,"The staff bent over backwards to make our stay 5 star!! The manager even carried our bedding for the extra bed up to our room for us!! You guys ROCK!! My kids had THE BEST time at your hotel and we will definitely be coming back!! Thanks again for saving the weekend!! If I could give a HIGHER rating I would!! We had 4 VERY happy kids today, THANK YOU!!!! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,The hotel room was quiet and I liked the staff.
POSITIVE,"Generally a good hotel in the price range. Very conveniently located. Parking lots is a bit of a free-for-all, being wrapped around the building and not well defined and perhaps a little under-sized."
POSITIVE,Great place to stay. Very clean and excellent breakfast.
POSITIVE,This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel. I really have enjoyed my stays here and my lil girl likes it too. I don't know if she had more fun with me or the fact that I let her ride up and down the elevators on the luggage cart. The staff was very friendly and the continental breakfast was just okay. But I will always plan on staying at thisÂ location when I am going to visit my lil girl in ft worth.
POSITIVE,"This was the place to stay in the area! By far the best that area had to offer, Clean and New!"
NEUTRAL,"Comfortable, large room and a hot breakfast. Nice pool & hot tub. Not easily found even tho it's right next to the Interstate because it's back behind the Taco Bell."
NEGATIVE,"Disliked: Food, Service, Atmosphere, Value"
POSITIVE,staff was very helpful hotel was a bit dated
POSITIVE,"I work in town and stay here three days a week. Clean. Quiet. No chamber maids bothering you at 8am. A deal! Liked: Rooms, Service, Value, Room decor, price, cleanliness Disliked: Location"
POSITIVE,"excellent location people friendly, food was good, Pros: every thing Cons: none Location: beautiful"
POSITIVE,"Spent eight nights here in February 2012 for a ski-ing break.. Friendly and helpful reception. The room booked was an Efficiency with a full kitchen, enough equipment provided to make simple meals, a lounge area with an open fire, and 2 bedrooms, one being in the loft. The internal bathroom was small but satisfactory. The room was cleaned every day to a high standard and items such as coffee for the coffee maker were regularly re-charged. As others have said a 10 minute walk takes you into central Jasper. We only used the restaurant once in the evening which was fine. In room free internet was available which we used however it did occasionally 'trip out' some evenings for what ever reason. Any outage was of short duration. All in all a good stay!"
NEGATIVE,"My credit card was billed for a reservation 3 days after the reservation was made. The reservation wasn't for several weeks out. When I called to cancel they couldn't find my name as being registered and the manager after 4 attempts would not return my calls. The bottom line is they billed me for a room I never used, refused to even talk to me about it even though they admitted they could even find my name as a registered guest. This cost me $69.99, a mistake I won't make again."
POSITIVE,Pros: Very nice room and motel.
POSITIVE,I had a really pleasant stay at the hotel. Hotel staff was very friendly. We stayed there for 3 nights. Beds and room was very comfortable. We also had mini fridge and microwave in our rooms. Its a well kept and very clean hotel. Breakfast was great. They had hot breakfast buffet with lots of variety. Our family enjoyed it very much. Thank you Best Western Manhattan.
POSITIVE,"I missed the front door when I arrived, and ended up in an office building. I think the front entrance should be better directed. Eveyone was very courtious and acconadating, I was impressed. The breakfast I would characterize as OK. The eggs were somewhat overdone, and were cool to the touch. I saw a waffle iron but no batter so I skipped it. I don'tÂ think I was too early, so I was a little puzzled."
POSITIVE,Location and price.
POSITIVE,"Great location, worth spending the extra to have a view. Had a balcony room looking over the harbour! Decent enough pool too. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed at the Jasper Inn as part of a 2 week trip through the Rockies with Australian relatives. I've stayed here many times before, but had not stayed there since their renovations. The renovated rooms a marked improvement over their previous decor. Our 1 bedroom room was reasonably well appointed and had tons of space, including a private ski locker right next to the door. The kitchenette is extremely basic as far as kitchen utensils and tools are concerned; ours did not have a can or bottle opener in it, so plan accordingly. The fireplace is a nice touch and the kids that traveled with us were really excited to see elk walking right past their window. One of the many benefits of being away from all of the major traffic and bars along the two main streets. Overall, I think the Jasper Inn is great value for a short or extended stay in Jasper."
NEGATIVE,"The stafff was rude, especially the older african american manager I think his name was glenn. Parking was 30 a day and you are not guaranteed to have a parking space if the hotel is full they double park. so if you leave the hotel, you may have to park down the street when you get back. I smells like old mop water. If you want to stay somewhere that is not safe this is your place. you are not going to be close to any attractions such as canal street and bourbon. You will have to take a cab or walk over 2 miles. I hated my stay. The rooms are really small maybe enough room for a couple but not a group. Room Tip: rooms are small"
POSITIVE,Staff very helpful and friendly. Room nice and clean. Modern decor. Very close to Earl's Court Tube station. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,Excellent prize for a Disney Hotel. You cannot find a better prize. Very close to the Universal Studios and Island of Adventure.
POSITIVE,"Somehow I overlooked the fact that we would be getting a suite instead of a room so we were very pleasantly surprised to discover we had a kitchenette (which we didn't use) and a sitting area with loveseat and television giving the room a more spacious feel. We would stay at Best Western Foothills again as there was absolutely nothing wrong with our room or the hotel. We were told when we checked in that the restaurant right next door, the Village Inn, would give those staying at Foothills a 20% discount on all meals. We ate there for breakfast several times and dinner when we arrived and the food was much better than average and we did get the discount every time. Breakfast at the hotel came with the room price and I did go down to their on-site dining area but just got some coffee; I did notice three chafing dishes with hot food and many guests were eating there so that is an option. This Best Western we found to be a notch nicer than the Best Western on Stone Avenue (near the University). Location: Oracle and Orange Grove is a great location for getting to shopping areas or Saguaro National Park West fast."
POSITIVE,"I visit Lake Placid at least two times a year. I always stay at the Best Western Adirondack Inn. I find the oversized bedrooms very comfortable, the staff very friendly and helpful and the location is unbeatable. I was there this weekend to hike one of the 46 high peaks with my friends. We had a great dinner at the restaurant (Nicola's) right next door to the hotel, then went for a nice stroll down mainstreet, then back to the hotel for a great nights sleep in preparation for our 12 mile hike early the next morning. They have an indoor swimming pool which was just updated with a new liner , hot tub and a sauna which were great for my aching muscles after the hike. The hotel has a great adirondack feel to it. I highly recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,We stay here almost every Christmas rather than burden family space. It is a bit tricky getting to the motel coming from south to north on 65. Just get directions how to get on the west side outer road. We always found it worth the price. We weren't sure how to work the TV but the desk clerk came immediately and corrected the problem. Rooms have been roomy and clean. We will stay here again.
POSITIVE,"We had a nice stay! Clean rooms, clean pool and nice employee's. Like playing racket ball but why do the guest have to pay to play. See you next time. :)"
NEUTRAL,"The room was fine. But there was too much noise clear up until 3 am by people outside near the pool. But the problem was when I checked out. The room was prepaid, and upon checking out I was told that I had a $4.60 charge for incidentals that was entered into the computer the day that I checked in. The worker could not tell me what it was for. She justÂ said that she was the one that entered it in but couldn't remember doing it. So, she supposedly reversed the charge. But it was not reversed, my credit card was still charged. I will never stay there again!"
POSITIVE,Easy freeway access only a mile from Pismo beach and pier. Great view
NEUTRAL,LocalizaÃ§Ã£o e custo beneficio
NEUTRAL,"Stayed two nights and unfortunately they changed my rates from my reservation. I am still working with Best Western to get that corrected, $40 per night is a lot and seems they may be trying to pull a fast one. The room was nice, very spacious, fridge and microwave. Sink outside bath, and sink inside bath! Window in bathroom too. 2nd floor - this helps avoid bugs in florida. Pool very clean but very warm water, open till midnight! Room was good, close location but you do have to walk 3-5 blocks to get near action of Duval St. Room Tip: 2nd Floor to avoid bugs in Florida"
POSITIVE,"Very convenient; right off Hwy.94. Great for family vacation/reunion--on-site bar, restaurant, pool, workout facility, microwave/frig in rooms, pet friendly rooms, (great!) breakfast included with room, very friendly and accommodating staff -- all adds up to great (family) time."
POSITIVE,"We were quite impressed with this hotel. Great thought has gone into the decorating; the furniture--beds, sofa, chairs, even the chairs in the dining area--was VERY comfortable. The bathrooms were nicely appointed. Access was easy-off, easy-on the interstate system, and the area feels safe. Very nice stay."
NEGATIVE,Good
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Plus Richmond Hill Inn was much better than we expected. It is one of the only few pet friendly hotels in the area. The staff was friendly. The location was within a reasonable distance to Savannah, Hilton Head and Tybee Island. We had a great stay! No complaints what so ever. You won't be disappointed."
POSITIVE,"This felt like a swanky hotel that should have cost way more. Beautiful courtyard with pool, spa and sitting area to drink wine or eat. Super continental breakfast. Walking distance to Historic Downtown area. Clean room and friendly staff. All rooms, except ours, have a patio and bottom floor patio opens up to pool area. So maker sure you ask for this.Â We will be back."
POSITIVE,"We chose this hotel after reading other reveiws and by Key West standards it was a good price. The room was very clean and spacious. It had a lovely pool area and the location was good for the south beaches. We found Higgs Beach to be best beach closest to the hotel and there was also parking there if you didn't want to walk. The breakfast was adequate, just continental, but it did get a little crowded at times as it was in the small lobby area.This is our only critisism. Key West can be bad for parking at times so it was an added bonus to have on site parking as most of the main attractions like the sunset at Mallory Square and the Historic seaport can all be reached on foot."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed at this hotel for two weeks working in San Mateo. The hotel was clean and the staff ever so helpful. Free ""good enough"" Wi-Fi and decent desks to work at. The walls are a bit thin, so expect to hear when your neighbors get up in the morning and when they watch TV. The breakfast isn't all that. All pre-made and to much sugar even by American standards. The selection is also extremely limited. Room Tip: Get a room on the top floor to limit noise. Also as far away from the freeway as possible. 42* is a..."
NEUTRAL,"Needed to stay in the area for a family function. The hotel is at the top of a super steep hill. The rooms were ok but clean. The breakfast was good. It did cost more than is expected for the property. Used the swimming pool, it was pretty good."
POSITIVE,Hotel was nice and room was smoke free. My only complaint is that the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke
POSITIVE,Charlotte is a great city and the Best Western Hotel was very nice. It exceeded our expectations.Pros: The price was unbelievable. Great value!
NEUTRAL,The hotel is located outside the main city. The rooms were ok and so was the bathroom. The breakfast didn't contain much but was still fine. But it was comfortable for 2 nights.
POSITIVE,A short walk down a residential street to the beach. Beach not very crowded when we were there in late April. Staff very friendly and helpful. A good selection for breakfast. The room was spacious and clean.
NEUTRAL,"Our first night was very trying, our room had puckered carpet with multiple stains, stuffing coming out of the arm of the sofa, a heater so noisy that the thunking and clunking kept waking us up, yet it never really heated the room adequately. The room had the bathroom sink separate from the shower/toilet which we hated. Although the floor appearedÂ to be non-smoking we could still smell stale cigarette smoke lingering in the hallway. The staff moved us to a much better room in the tower for the second night and that almost makes up for consigning us to that Siberia of a room the first night. The hotel has a good location for West Edmonton Mall and the staff was very good, friendly and responsive to our needs. If they keep renovating and get the hotel up to a reasonable standard it would be a very good property."
POSITIVE,"My nephew and I stayed at the Best Western LBV the week of Dec 2, 2010 in Room 1606. We had a great stay and will be going back in April 2011. Here are my thoughts about this hotel. 1. - Exemplary Customer service. Every staff member I met was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. I was particularly impressed by the hotel manager, Mike Bagley. He e-mailed me back and forth many, many times to answer my questions and to be sure that I would be happy with my hotel stay. This communication was done before and after my stay. He really cared! Superb customer service!. In fact. all of the hotel personnel were very gracious. There was no delay during check in. It went very fast with a happy, prompt and attentive reception clerk. 2.- The room was very comfortable. It had more room than most of the hotels/motels I stay in when I am at WDW (go about 2-3 times a year). The beds and pillows were very comfy. The TV had great picture quality with great reception/channels. Very clean throughout the hotel. Our room was spotless as were the hallways and the lobby. Someone mentioned that the hallway was less than ideal. Our floor, the 16th, was first-rate. The hallways had beautiful carpet and were very clean. I was especially impressed by the sound proofing in the room. We had just come off a flight where we had screaming/crying children in the row behind us and in the row to our right. This went on for the entire flight and I was especially aware of any noise after that. During our stay, there were large groups of teenage band members. Even though they were on our floor and one night were pounding on the door to be let in, we were unable to hear them until I opened our hotel door. Great soundproofing! 3.- Parking was fine . However, I am handicapped so I was able to find a parking spot. The valet that helped us the first night couldn't have been kinder or more efficient. I should have written his name down but I thought I would remember it. He showed us the different handicapped parking spots around the hotel so that we never had a parking problem. Even when we did not use his services he was always friendly and smiling to us. I was very impressed with him. 4.- I wish I had paid the $20 upgrade to a Disney view room. I was disappointed that we were not able to open the patio door windows unless we wanted to hear LOTS of road noise from I-4 and from Hotel Plaza Blvd. However, the double pane windows effectively blocked out ALL noise when closed. It really didn't matter that much about not being able to be on the balcony as Florida was cold during the time we were there. I had brought a jacket from Minnesota that had a fleece lining that could be unzipped and taken out. However, I kept this lining in the whole vacation. 5. - Very fast elevators. We were on the 16th floor and usually waited less than a minute for an elevator to come up to this floor. Going down was just as speedy. I believe they had four elevators that were always in service so this made travel very swift. 6. Internet service was fine. No problems at all. 7. This hotel was in an excellent location. This was our first time staying here and I was impressed. It is very close to everything. I love Steak and Shake (great $3.99 meals) and there was one very close by. There was also a Sizzler's that we ate breakfast at every day (had a $3.99 coupon from one of the many magazines floating around). The one day that I took pictures it had just rained and they were on the dark side so I didn't include any. I mostly took pictures of the view which was of Hotel Plaza Boulevard."
POSITIVE,"Very clean room. Exercise room had plenty of air and equipment worked. Pool was clean and quite. Only problem was after checkin, the room we were assigned was next to very noisy children and an absent parent and our room key didn't work. Corilina assigned us a new room that was great. Also the beds aren't that hard. We would stay again."
POSITIVE,"This was a great experience. My whole family enjoyed the stay, perfect location, near several eats and very close to Yosemite south entrance. We will definately be coming back."
POSITIVE,"Great rooms $99 best morning meal. And good local dinning discount. AAAA++++ Liked: Rooms, Pool spa"
NEUTRAL,I was there for the Freedom Hall Women of JOY conference. It was a very pleasant place and the room was nice...we preferred NON-Smoking but only a KING room was available...The SMOKE smell was over whelming but the Maintenance GUY did come up and ODERIZE it for us...The employee that took care of the Breakfast area was possibly overwhelmed...but she was rude to one of the ladies in another group about getting a MUFFIN out of the container with her hands EVEN though they were individually wrapped to begin with...She slapped her hand and told her to use the TONGS....then Proceeded to PINCH her and it left a Mark.....I really think she could use a DAY OFF! The kind hearted LADY did not make a COMPLAINT but my daughter witnessed the whole thing and was very disappointed by the employees behavior. Customer Service should be FIRST! NO TOUCH- PINCH or Slap Customers...
POSITIVE,The setting was a litte strange as it was in the middle of a courtyard but the room was nice. Modern art deco style..extremely convenient location.... had great night sleep and the breakfast was great...
POSITIVE,"Great Breakfast, super clean, hotel looked new......"
POSITIVE,For parents and family visiting students at SBU this is a convenient and reasonably priced place to stay One problem - wi-fi worked only intermitently
POSITIVE,"the beds were comfortable our air conditioner was broken it was in a good location for the aquarium, cocacola , cnn building , the childrens musuem even the hard rock cafe and a must durango steakhouse. The only problem i had was out air conditioner didnt work properly so it was really stuffy in the room"
POSITIVE,"Still trying to arrange for FEDEX shipment of a shirt I left in the closet and this turning out to be a major inconvienance even after I set up my acct. with FEDEX and contacted the hotel for pickup/delivery to my home. Someone dropped the ball on informatio relayed (perhaps FEDEX) but still, after 4 days need to call LOST/FOUND to straighten this out. [?] Please help me guys, I listened to everyone who instructed me and yet it has not been resolved. Will TKU when I finally get my property bak. P.S. Had to spend the morning in an out of town Med Center prior to depature so was distracted with my belongings and relied on my family to check contents of room. Sadly this was missed due to their concern for my welfare but I,m sure it will b resolved. BW, LI, NY"
POSITIVE,"Truth be told when we pulled up we thought for sure that we were going to be moving on to the next town (this is the only place in town). However, once we checked in we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were great... updated, clean, and spacious. The pool was also nice- considering the 90+ temps. The only drawback was they didn't have wifi. They did have wired internet in the rooms though and offered the cable as well. And the only place to really eat was the hotels restaurant which wasn't too bad either. I'd stay here again."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was amazing on customer service!! We moved houses and towed a uhaul so did not want to leave valuables unattended im the vacant lot nearby and there was no room in the regular hotel parking lot so security came and helped us specially park and set up cones to divert traffic where the car stuck out of the parking lane. The rooms were fine, but our drain was clogged, and upon telling the front desk they took $10 off our bill. We later realized we left a therapeutic pillow and they called us and told us they would send the pillow to our house free of charge. Stacy the front desk is fantastic dealing w customers! Liked: Service"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I with our 2 children just enjoyed 2 nights at this convenient anf comfortable Best Western in Burlington. We had adjoining rooms ( 1 double and 1 suite).and the rooms were spacious and well-furnished. They were clean and quiet, and the staff was very helpful. A nice buiffet breakfast is served daily, and it was delicious. We would definitely return to this very nice motel."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel room was very small for 2 double beds. Television was broken, kept getting snowy. There was no place to store a suitcase and the room only had 1 chair and a small table. There were 4 of us in the room and it was very congested. Luckily, we were only there for the Yankees game and stayed only one night. Cannot comment on the breakfast as we hadÂ other plans. The room was expensive for the room we got, but it was convenient to NYC."
POSITIVE,"We were looking for a hotel with an indoor pool, restaurants within walking distance, and quick access to the interstate. The Best Western Carlton Suites in Birmingham exceeded our expectations with it cleanliness and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I had a chance to speak with general manager Rony Naik on the morning of our departure and expressed my satisfaction with our stay. Our two boys loved the indoor pool and the suite allowed my wife and myself to watch one t.v., while the boys were able to watch in the adjoining area. Also, the breakfast that was included more than satisfied our family."
NEGATIVE,"Over the years, I've stayed at a lot of hotels around the world (including Best Western). In terms of cleanliness, this particular hotel left a lot to be desired. When we went to our room on the first day of our stay, there was excrement at top of the stairs (2nd floor). When we left (after 2 nights stay), the excrement was still there. The stairs leading up to the second story, looked like they hadn't been swept in days. There were broken pieces of plastic on the stairs for the duration of our stay. My son went to open the shades and a dead fly was stuck to the curtain. There was also a dead fly squished on one of the lights in the room. I woke up in the middle of the night to pull my covers up, and all I could smell on the sheets was cigarette smoke (this was supposed to be a non-smoking room). When we were leaving the hotel, there was a couple sitting in their non-smoking room (with their door open) and they were smoking. We were told that there would be a hot breakfast at this hotel. When we went to the room for breakfast, they had cold eggs and bacon with a sign next to them that said microwave for 15 seconds. How is this a hot breakfast? I personally was very disappointed in our stay at the Best Western Country Squire in Winchester, KY. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. In our 14 days visiting Tennessee and Kentucky, this was by far the worst accommodations that we had."
NEUTRAL,"An ok budget hotel, feel secure when you come with a car. The room is tiny and old. My bed sheets even got holes on it."
NEGATIVE,"The location was OK.The room was your typical hotel room,the doors to the room need to be replaced as they did not latch correctly,the guy at the front desk was not the freindliest person,it was like you were putting him out by showing up at the front desk. This was not like all the other Best western's I have stayed in. For the price i would look aroundÂ a little more,there are lot's of hotels in this area."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for 1 night for a wedding weekend with my fiancee. The location is convenient to the area attractions and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable. The grounds were well kept and clean. There was ample parking. The free breakfast was a great addition and had more options than I expected. Honestly, I didn't go into this stay expecting much since I really just needed a place to rest my head between a rehearsal and a morning wedding, but I had absolutely no complaints. The hotel was affordable, convenient, and clean. Room Tip: Get the cheapest room you can. I did, and it still met expectations."
POSITIVE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! The room was amazing, pool was amazing, food was amazing, everything was amazing! This was a great opportunity for me to get out of the house! When I am at home after work itâs so easy to get caught up in cleaning/cooking, I donât take the time to play with the kids as much as I should. Breakfast was great too, how EASY, walk downstairs and everything you and the kids want is all there waiting for you â and then, WALK away from it all and off to work! SDM Female"
POSITIVE,"1) Parking was free 2) The neighborhood is great. There are 2 or 3 of each of the following within 3 blocks: Deli & Sandwich shops, Indian restaurants, Sushi places, coffee shops, liquor stores, pharmacy, and grocery stores. Whatever you want, it's there. 3) Clean room, etc, not the biggest room, but in that neighborhood, you shouldn't be in yourÂ room anyway, go outside and play."
POSITIVE,"Driving up to the Heritage Inn on the side of the freeway, I was expecting a loud, rough sleep. Thankfully this was not the case. After checking in, I settled into my room and was very pleased with what looked like a redecorated room. Yes, the noise is loud but I flipped on the fan, jumped into the pillowtop bed with 4 yummy pillows and watched some TV. The room came with a refrig and microwave which helps when you have travel food. For the price and the comfort of the Inn, I recommend it as a good value especially for a long travel day. Pick up food before you get here though there is only an IHOP and a couple of gas stations for food options. Room Tip: Used my AAA card and got about 20% of the room."
POSITIVE,"Location is great, right off the highway and easy commute from Fr. Myers Airport."
POSITIVE,"Great place for my parents to stay when they come to San Luis to visit me! Close to restaurants, grocery store, and dog park for our puppy. The pool is nice, room was comfortable, and employees were super friendly and accommodating! Would stay here again in a second."
POSITIVE,"I booked this hotel for myself and 2 of my friends......we were to attend a concert at Michigan State University........when I booked it there was absolutely no other hotel in Lansing that had anything available......so I wasn't expecting much. In fact my exact words to my friends were ""girls, this was all that was left......if there are no bugs and we get to sleep that's all we're looking for"". Well, let me tell you!!!! Not only was the hotel fitting for a princess the staff couldn't have been any more helpful, nice, courteous and literally bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable and welcome as possible. All in all a wonderful little trip to a absolutely CLEAN and WONDERFUL hotel!!!!!!! They even had a free BBQ for the the people staying there for the event!!! If you plan on staying in East Lansing you really must check out this hotel!!!!!"
POSITIVE,Great place to stay with your dog. There is a dog run and within walking distance to a dog park with great hiking trails. Also close to Madonna Inn and short drive to the beach.
NEUTRAL,Nice place to stay. People were very helpful. Breakfast was good. Thank you
NEUTRAL,"Our rooms were clean and adequate and super close to Rollins. HOWEVER I can not give high marks to the front desk staff. First at check in it seemed they were a bit put off that they had to check to see if our rooms were cleaned and ready. Excuse us for being 15minutes early. Also when I inquired about Parent's Weekend Nov 2011, the one employee simply stated sold out. There was another employee who said no those queen rooms never sell. The original person didn't check and said no sold out. REALLY!!! Loved the location but Front Desk Staff deplorable at the very best!!"
NEUTRAL,"The rooms aren't horrible, the beds are surprisingly kind of comfortable. I think what I most like about this hotel was it's location, right next to 5 freeway, 3 min from the beach, and maybe 5 from downtown. Definitely not a Hilton or double tree inn. But for a couple a nights it's not such a bad decision. I so have to say though, the room service isn't the greatest. They do a mickey mouse of a job, don't look under your bed if you decide to stay here!"
POSITIVE,"its my second time around at this hotel first its with my friend and then by my self . for its very affordable for a single guy like me . nice location ,less than 5min away from my friends in san diego ."
POSITIVE,We really liked this hotel. The staff was very friendly and oddly the first thing I thought when I walked in the room was that it had the most pleasant and comforting smell to it. If I had to say anything negative it would just be that it isn't close to any of the major things to do in the city (but it IS very close and convenient to major highwaysÂ to get to those things) and there isn't much to do in the immediate area as far as restaurants and such. Overall we were really happy with our stay.
POSITIVE,"My husband and I (recently married) just returned from three wonderful nights at the BW Plus Cavalier Oceanfront Resort! I started coming here with my parents in the 80's when we lived in LA on long weekend getaways from the chaos of the big city. It was a home away from home and truly has a very special place in my heart when I look back on my childhood. I was so excited to share Morro Bay, Cayucos, Cambria and San Simeon with my husband, as he had never been to the Central Coast (we live in Indy). I have to admit, I was really nervous that my memories had been exaggerated over time and like most things in life, the hotel would have changed. Nothing made me happier to pull up under the portico to see the fire place ablaze in the lobby, friendly faces behind the desk and a beautifully maintained (even upgraded with new amenities) room right along the ocean - we stayed in a room with an ocean view - AWESOME room!!! The fire pits along the coastline are a fabulous addition and were a great meeting spot for the guests to chat over a bottle of wine or a romantic spot to watch the sun set. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were quiet and clean, windows/ sliding glass doors were spotless, and the fireplace kept us toasty during a unseasonable week of rain. Perhaps I am biased, but believe me - when it comes to travel, I tend to be a harsh critic. BW Plus Cavalier, thank you for continuing to be a wonderful host after so many years. I look forward to bringing my parents back for a visit and one day, sharing this special place with my kids. Thank you!"
NEGATIVE,"We had asked for a non smoking room and ended up in a PREVIOUS smoking room which was terrible to sleep at night and everytime we walked in the door that is all we could smell. I have allergies so needless to say it was a very uncomfortable night, we will not go back unless we definitley have a room that was never used for smoking. The breakfast wasÂ good and the workers were very good."
POSITIVE,We were visiting friends in Katy and this hotel was very easy to find and convenient to our destination in Cinco Ranch. Hotel seemed fairly new and very clean.
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel in a very inconvenient location. Traffic was horrible the weekend of our stay. Fifteen miles from Busch, I wish i wouldve listened to my fiancÃ¨ and booked downtown. It would've saved a lot of time and stress. However, they had very nice remodeled rooms and a vast variety of amenities (including complimentary hot breakfast which is aÂ big hit for me so those meals saved the budget!) The staff was very catering to our needs and we had a lot of them since we were traveling with a 4mo old :)"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was in a great location and nice to have a store and restaurant downstairs. The pier was right in front of us too. The hotel was a little run down but not too bad. We went to the pool that evening and there were no pool towels available and when I picked up the phone to call for more towels, the phone didn't work. This was a little aggravating.Â The pool water was cold, I'm guessing that it is not heated. The breakfast area in the morning was very congested."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is super clean and kept up very nice. The landscaping was beautiful and the staff was great! It was very close to Sea World which makes it very convenient when you are traveling with kids. They have a big pool that's 8 ft deep - kids loved it because they could dive. : ) They also had a wk out room right in front of the pool with window whereÂ you could see out in the pool in case your kids were swimming while you worked out. They had a ping pong table out in the pool area which the kids also loved! A bar is also right there. They had 2 jacuzzi's - 1 at the pool area and 1 right around the corner which was nicely secluded and bigger! I would totally recommend this hotel! The only downfall was that the rooms are very small. The description said it had 2 queens, but it was more like sleeping on a full bed. Definitely avoid the restaurant on site!!! This place was way overpriced. We went in and ordered 5 drinks and saw the prices and decided to go elsewhere! Our 5 drinks came out to just a little under $20!!! And 3 of those drinks were kids drinks!!! Overall this was a very nice and clean hotel in a good location, but its not for big families! E&L;"
POSITIVE,We stayed Saturday night because we were next door at the Super 8 and had a horrible experience there and ended up cancelling our room for Saturday. The people that were working here had fantastic customer service and were very polite and couteous. Over all I will book there again!! GREAT GREAT GREAT!!
POSITIVE,"My daughter and I went to St. Louis for a mother - daughter shopping week-end and stayed at this Best Western. We were very pleased with our room. It was clean, the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Good water pressure in the shower. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a good bargain."
NEGATIVE,We stayed here for two nights...the 1st night was a nightmare since people from next door were awake the whoe night talking and laughing and you actually hear everything from next door. I would not stay here again.
POSITIVE,"i travel and stay at the childress best western while on business trips.the staff are always friendly and professional,if i ever need anything all i have to do is ask.the motel is clean and the management are constantly updating to keep standards and quality high.it is a nice comfortable place to stay ."
POSITIVE,This hotel was right downtown Kansas City near the Country Club Plaza and was great for the business conference that I was on. My wife was even impressed with the spaciousness of the room.
POSITIVE,Very clean and comfortable. Also serves breakfast until 10:00 which is nice for those of us who like to sleep in.
POSITIVE,"We attended a Royals game and stayed at this Best Western because of its overall rating and it was close to everything we wanted to do.The only down side was the breakfast room.(very small)Food was ok, but if you want to eat,better get there early."
NEUTRAL,"Overall, our room was clean. Not my first choice for Bismarck. A little high priced for the quality. Hotel is dated. Could be classed as a 1 or at the most 1-1/2 star. Does not fall in the same group as other hotels at this star level. Pros: Fridge, microwave in room. Relatively clean room. Cons: Hallways run down, dirty . Need a face lift or deep cleaning. Kids running in hallways with no adult supervision."
NEUTRAL,"I am in St. George at least one night every week on business. I use a well-known auction site most of the time to book a three star (i.e. Marriot/Hilton) hotel. I usually get a room for around $46 plus tax/fees. This time I decided to try a two and one-half star hotel. It still cost $46 plus and I won the bid at this Best Western property. It was my first stay at Coral Hills. I was given an updated (i.e. recently remodeled) room. It was clean, had nice beds with a good selectiono of pillows, a refrig/microwave, nice large LCD/flat panel TV, free local and USA Today newspapers, etc. My stay was pleasant and comfortable. Only two slight drawbacks: 1) the breakfast room at this property was being remodeled, so I had to go several blocks down the street to their sister BW property and eat there. Breakfast was nice, but nothing too fancy. 2) There was no soap dish/holder in the shower/tub. I thought this was really odd. There was no place to sit the soap while showering. First time I have ever encountered somethign like this. While I would stay here again if the price was right, I will probably just keep bidding $46 for a three star and stay at the Courtyard or Hilton Garden Inn. Overall, it was nice."
POSITIVE,"My family & I went to San Francisco for Spring Break & needed accommodations for a night. Since I am a Costco member and know about the discounted rates for members, I decided to do a little research and compare all of the Best Western hotels near the S.F. area. The decision came down to whether we wanted to stay near the airport or venture closer in to the city. I have read, re-read & read again many reviews about hotels in the city & decided (along with my husband) that perhaps we should stay relatively close to the airport where we felt might be safer with our 6-year old daughter. Boy were we glad we made the decision to stay here! Yeah, sure there's a $5.00 charge to park your car; a far cry from the $20 - $40 they charge in the city! The room is on the small side, but there were only three of us & we were only staying for the night, so it was comfortable enough. The bed, oh, I loved the bed! Nice and comfy. Breakfast in the morning, well, what can I say, we ate till our hearts content. There was scrambled eggs, corned beef hash, rice, potatoes, fresh fruits, cold cereal, breads to make toast along with your usual standard breakfast drinks. Finally, due to changes in our plans, the business center came in handy. I got to jump on the hotel computer & print our tickets for Disneyland! I'm not too sure about the WiFi though, because I couldn't catch anything in my room. Thankfully I have an android phone, so I really didn't need it anyway, so no problems there. So, was it worth the money we paid? Absolutely! Would we stay here again? Absolutely! Would we recommend this hotel to others? Absolutely! Room Tip: We requested a room with a nice view and got a room overlooking the parking lot and McDonald's..."
POSITIVE,"Staff was very friendly and so helpful! Large rooms with microwave and mini fridge! Beds were very comfy. Lovely area, will certainly stay again! :)"
POSITIVE,"The staff bent over backwards to solve a problem I had with something I forgot for my laptop. The beds were unusually comfortable, with 4 pillows on each!. Room was clean, breakfast was fine, all was great for less than 70 bucks, including tax."
POSITIVE,"Great Job! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
NEUTRAL,"I stayed over night on a Saturday night at this Best Western and honestly I was a little skeptical based on some of the reviews I read. Let's start by saying I paid half the price of one of what the AC casinos we're charging to stay over night which was a definite plus. The rooms could use some updating but honestly were not that bad. Rooms have a 27"" flat screen TV with cable, a microwave and decent size refrigerator & a security safe. Bathroom was a decent size and believe it or not the beds were pretty comfortable. If I go to AC again on a weekend I would definitely look into staying here again. The only down side is parking is tight if you don't get a space in the open lot but other than that it's not too bad."
POSITIVE,Excellent hotel. Will stay there again next year for the annual Sparkler Softball tournment. Very pleased.
POSITIVE,"Service at the front desk was excellent, and the staff actually offered us an extra discount on top of the original online rate without us even asking for it. The location was great, only about 10 minutes away from the south entrance of Yosemite and the giant sequoia trees. Overall, a very good experience and comfortable one-night stay. Highly recommended. Pros: Great service. The front desk was very helpful when we checked in. Cons: Nothing much. Just about everything was better than our expectations. Location: Excellent for a visit to Yosemite. The south entrance to the park is only about 10 minutes away."
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at this hotel 3 times over the past year. It's a good place for the price, especially if using a discount coupon easily found along the interstates.The building and parking area are starting to show their age, and the hotel is located near a trucking depot - rail yard. But it is quieter than one would predict and I've always felt safe. The rooms are good size with good tv, microwave, fridge, and free internet. People are friendly. I'll stay again. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"Con : -Night & early morning reception worked so slow to check in/out. Overall : I love the hotel location. I found shopping mall just 5 min away and nice restaurant near by. The hotel conditions are good, and it was very comfortable hotel."
NEUTRAL,"The Space Shuttle Inn is a motel, so you can park close to your room. Excellent directions are provided on the website. We had no problems finding the place. It was one of the more reasonably priced places close to the Kennedy Space Centre. I requested the second floor and adjoining rooms. That is what they gave us. The cost was $75 per room for 4 adults and 2 children for a Thursday and Friday. The rooms are very basic and clean with comfortable beds. There is a coffeemaker in the room. One of our rooms had a small fridge. The bathroom is small with a vanity/sink on the outside. There was a stuffy smell in the rooms, so we left the doors open for awhile. The website claims that the pool is heated, but the water was quite cool. I had to go to the front desk for pool towels. There are restaurants nearby. Durango steakhouse is on the premises. The Waffle House is next door.The small breakfast room closed at 9:30 am so we went to the Waffle House to eat. There were coupons for pizza (Poppa Johns) in the room so we ordered pizza the first night. It took a very long time before the pizza was finally delivered. The motel is decent place to stay for a couple of days. We were at the back of the hotel, facing a park which had paths and picnic tables. We were walking distance to a convenience store."
POSITIVE,Free breakfast. Free airport shuttle. Free wi-fi. Clean room. Great price. What else could you ask for?
NEGATIVE,"stayed at this hotel in March when the temps were in the 70's. the temps in the room were in the 80's! called the desk to find out how to turn on the air and was informed there wasnt any. was told the best i could do was to turn off the heat. the window opened 3 inches because of a lock (was on 2nd floor). We roasted for 2 days, didnt sleep well. come to find out, there were new remodeled rooms on the 3rd floor WITH AIR. no mention was made of this! nice pool area, but the hot tub was drained on saturday, so we never got to use it. was vey dissatisfied with this hotel. Room Tip: make sure your room is temperature controlled and 3rd floor rooms are remodled"
NEGATIVE,"For the money I paid the room seemed more like a motel. The bed was hard as a rock, while taking a shower the water was backing up so that I was standing in a half full tub, the room smelled like stale smoke. But the location is good and thebreakfeast was good."
POSITIVE,"This is an excellent place to stay. The staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and quiet, breakfast was good. It has a hot tub and pool. The location was perfect...in a quiet place but close to shopping and restaurants. Great value for the rate! Room Tip: If you are a light sleeper, ask to be on the upper floor at the end of the hall."
POSITIVE,"Had 2 reservations for King strip view rooms.Check in at 2:30 pm, neither was ready, and was informed that no kings were available...very dissapointing given that this was the slowest week of the year. Also, I had paid for the rooms in full some 2 1/2 months earlier, yet Monte Carlo couldn't give me what I reserved....AGAIN VERY DISSAPOINTED Pros: Casino Cons: Not the rooms I paid for Location: very nice with the tram to Aria and Bellagio"
POSITIVE,Great location. Clean and friendly staff. Loved the boardwalk
POSITIVE,I stay here everytime I am in the area. It is clean. It is hospitable. The staff are friendly. What more can you ask for!
POSITIVE,"Bar and lobby area are very nice. Had a buy one and get one free at bar, so it was a good night! Breakfast was surprisingly good. Room was clean. Good mid range motel."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here on two occasions, at the start and end of our vacation. Front of house staff helpful - shuttle service to and from the airport, first class - at least every half hour. Plenty to eat nearby. Is positioned on the freeway, depending which side of the hotel your located, but we found with the air con unit running and the balcony doors closed, we never heard it, and this includes aeroplanes. If you want to plane spot, it's ideal! Oh, and great breakfast. Best of the all the BW's we've stayed at."
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprized by the cleanliness, price of the rooms, very nice pool, and overall experience at this hotel. I think the only complaint we would have would be that the TV remote didn't work, and batteries didn't fix it. For the price of rooms for this Motel I would say about the best value in this area."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is a great find!! The room was exceptionally clean, the service was prompt and the breakfast was plentiful. I especially like the little touches such as the free movie rentals, the extra friendly service and the pool towels that were delivered to my children at the pool with out even asking. Looking forward to our next visit to the Best Western El Rancho already!!"
POSITIVE,"Great experience! Staff is super friendly - Tony is wonderful and the rooms are spotless. The only downside was the wi-fi didn't work throughout my stay (5 days), but there are tons of coffee shops around with free wi-fi. Oh - there is a *slight* weird smell, but I think it exists because the building is old. The hotel is on the cusp of the Tenderloin,Â so don't wander downhill at night if you aren't familiar with the hood."
POSITIVE,The price and the location to the Vegas airport and proximity to restaurants. Front desk staff was helpful and k nowledgeable about the area.
NEGATIVE,"on arriving at the hotel at around 2.15pm we were told our room wasn't ready so could we come back in 15 minutes time so we went into the bar area to find noone behind the bar so waited about 10 mins for a barman,after drinking our drinks we then went back to reception only to find our aledged up grade room still wasn't ready so we were offered a bigger room which we took especially after seeing the room they intended to give us as 'up grade room' was clearly just a standard room.After spending about an hour or so milling about the reception area we were aventually given the key but still wasn't told what time breakfast or dinner was or where to go to get it if i wouldn't have already paid i would have gone else where the reception staff kids really i forgot my razor so my partner said it,s ok they have them at reception so at 8pm i asked at the desk for a razor only to be told they didn't have ant there but would have one sent up to my room 45 mins later no razor and never heard anymore about the subject,whilst we were checking out the man in front of us who was also checking out said that they never received the complementary cream teas on arrival needless to say we didn't get one either but when we mentioned it to a guy on reception he was a bit arragant and said it was company policy that he couldn't do anything to rectify it now yet we were hanging around for an eternity but nobody thought of offering us the cream tea while we were waiting for our room after driving 250 miles to get there. Room Tip: try another hotel"
POSITIVE,"Hotel was clean and roomy, beds were comfortable. Breakfast is basically cereal and waffles."
POSITIVE,Very friendly staff - great location.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was comfortable, clean and located near where my destination was."
POSITIVE,"While this particular hotel has seen better days - it needs some serious refurbishing and updating - it is still a great place to stay. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the location is good - and there are some great local restaurants nearby (a Chinese buffee and a Greek cafe are our favorites). You are a short drive to the ocean - lots of state and county beaches - which make this a great stay.The breakfast is adequate, and while we didn't use it, the pool looked pleasant enough.We'll still stay here next time we're back in Arcata."
POSITIVE,Great location. A few minutes from cirque and the old city of Quebec. Service was rude. Made us wait until 430pm for the room and while still rushing us out by 12pm. Pros: Close to venues and old quebec.. Cons: Service sucks..
POSITIVE,"I experienced that the employees were passionate in serving me and observed the same toward other guests. The room was very comfortable, clean and appeared to have an updated look. They had a recycling can in the room. The refrigerator was off when I arrived (saving energy was the reason as noted for guests to read). I can\u2019t list them all, but a very environmentally friendly policy was evident throughout. I am curious to know when they did their last big renovation. But suspect that the hotel owners simply take great pride in maintain their property. When adding everything up, I believe that the hotel owners and all employees should be very proud of their accomplishments. I Hope Best Western Corporate receive this message. A great example of how all Best Western properties should strive to become."
POSITIVE,great and they were nice... very clean and everything was super
POSITIVE,"My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Pavilion in York to celebrate our 35th Wedding anniversary. The stay was booked and paid for as part of the Tesco voucher deal, this entailed that the stay cost us very little. We arrived on the Monday afternoon the booking in was very efficient and our questions about obtaining afternoon tea and the route to walk into York were answered with ease, two alternate routes to walk in were explained in detail, one route along the river bank and one route in by footpath, we chose to walk along the river. As stated it took approx 35mins and was a very pleasant walk. We also enquired about the bus service into York and details of this was readily given, the location of bus stops, frequency of service etc. this local knowledge made our stay in York much more enjoyable. The room although not overly large was sufficient for our needs; it was clean on arrival and kept that way through the duration of our stay. The breakfast was good the choice of continental OK, although fresh orange would have been preferred to tinned orange, however the quality was fine, all cooked breakfasts are cooked to order and are delivered to the table hot. I have stayed in York before for business at another city center hotel, should I need to visit York on business again I will stay at the Pavilion and catch the bus in."
POSITIVE,"My boyfriend and I stayed here in August and were very pleased with our stay. The room and bed were very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent, including some muffins that tasted homemade. We stayed at multiple hotels during our California trip, some that were much more expensive, but we both agreed this was the best hotel we had stayed at for the value and comfort."
NEUTRAL,Location Not friendly hotel staff
POSITIVE,"I stayed at BW while in Albany for the NY Bar Exam. During this difficult period, the staff at the hotel went above and beyond to help me feel comfortable and relaxed. Everyone in our group was happy with the accomodations. Thank you for everything! :)"
POSITIVE,we rented 2 rooms for us and family and the everyone treated us awesome and helped with all our needs. everything clean and quiet very good place to stay
NEUTRAL,"Outdoor pool was closed when we came, but motel overall had the barebones we needed for a quick over night stay. Asked for a different room as they had our non-smoking room joined to a smoking room. Cheap stay, nice staff."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed there on ourway from the Keys to Bonita Springs. We arrived relatively late in the evening (9.00) an were greeted and treated without any smile. The room we got was in the darkest corner of the basement next to the janitors storage, promissing al noisy morning. The hotel wasn't full! So i went back to the reception for another room. We got one on the first floor wich was much better. Breakfast was good."
NEGATIVE,"My expectation was rather low upon arrival. The exterior is reminiscent of a ""hole in the wall"". Had I not parked and walked the block peering at the addresses, I would have never known it is there. But once inside, I felt safe, secure and atease. The room was clean and larger than I'd expected. Included was a refrigerator to store my left over dinner. Although, I didn't arrive until after 9:30PM, the young lady on the desk was wonderfully accommodating. I had to check out too early to try the breakfast buffet, which would have been another plus. Whenever I am working the Baltimore Convention Center/Harbor, I will choose the Envy again. It's an excellent value for the travelling tradesman."
POSITIVE,"My first try was a Hilton, but they were booked and then the price was much higher. My husband and I had a horrible experience with Continental/ United. A canceled morning flight that was to depart at 11:30 a.m. and rescheduled at 7:30 p,m. without even notifying us. Stayed 9 hours in the Newark Airport, for a 40 min. flight. , the flight left after 9p.m. By the time we arrived at the Best Western it was going on 1 a.m. The employee's I spoke with were always friendly, and helpful. As I entered door 5, I got a little concerned. BUT, when I got to the room, all was WELL. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable and especially the WONDERFUL PILLOWS!!. Sheets were clean and crisp and felt good.Really nice especially for the price. Check out was noon, and we took advantage of it since we were such late arrivals."
NEGATIVE,"Like my title says, it got the job done. We could hear the interstate traffic all night and the pillows were uncomfortable (all one firmness so that 1 wasn't enough and 2 was too much). Otherwise, everything was what you'd expect for the price wepaid (77$). I'd only recommend this hotel as a pit-stop to another hotel."
POSITIVE,"Second time staying here and love it. Nice rooms good service and includes a full breakfast. Highly recommend!!!! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,It was fine for one night. The breakfast was nice. Pros: Price. Cons: No swimming pool or hot tub.
NEUTRAL,"Nice location, nice parking lot, huge pool and breakfast area. But the beds were very hard. I spoke with another couple I know who was staying there and they had the same problem. In the end we just folded the comforter and placed it under the sheets which made it ok. Pros: location Cons: bed Location: close to the freeway without the noise"
POSITIVE,"The hotel deserves A+ marks for location (5min walk to downtown squire, park, restaurants), room size & comfort, staff friendliness and professionalism. The courtyard is very pretty with a pool and lots of attractive plants. I think all rooms face the courtyard. The facility (style of the building, furnishings, appliances) shows it's age, but nothing dramatic. I would say it is well cared for. Lastly, as we've learned during the trip, Sonoma is a great place to stay for the Napa/Sonoma Valley trips. Downtown is vacation-perfect with superb restaurants and cute little shops around community park."
NEGATIVE,"Glass on the floor, poor lighting, damaged wall, peeling wallpaper and paint, smelly pillows (really disgusting) dirty couch with spill marks, cover on bed with a large burn hole in it, noise from drunks, room service (Perkins) made me ill and the health dept. found issues, the receptionist was obnoxious and rude and unwilling to have the atm keyboard cleaned of the spittal, the ice bucket was cracked and leaked over my laptop and clothes, The carpets are all stained and shoddy. Wynham (who franchaises these) did nothing but pass on mycomplaints and the owners of Travelodge did not answer any of my letters. TERRIBLE!!!!"
POSITIVE,"Lorraina at the front desk was very friendly. Property is only a couple years old and looks to be well kept. Rooms are nicely decorated, spacious and clean. Bathroom has granite counter top and shower walls. The fan for the ac/heater is a little loud. Overall a positive stay. I would stay here again. Liked: Clean, spacious room"
POSITIVE,"Very good including price and breakfasts. That' s enough. Pros: Staff very good, breakfast excellent and varied Cons: nothing really Location: not easy to reach from the interstate"
NEGATIVE,"I would not stay at this hotel again. The staff gave my reserved room to another guest with the same last name and they were unable to figure this out for 45 minutes. They gave me another room, we parked got all of our luggage out of the car, carried them to the room and we discovered it was not the room we had reserved. It had a single bed we requested two beds. The staffcould have easily checked this before they assigned us another room. We had to put our luggage back in the car then wait in line again and get another room. It took approximately two hours to check in with the correct room. ... Cons: Correction of a problem."
POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the fact that a 'noise ordinance' was implemented at this hotel but unfortunately it didn't seem to be enforced until I called the lobby. Positive note, it was quickly addressed. Pros: On-site restaurant Cons: noise ordinance wasn't enforced Location: very close proximity to UVM & downtown area"
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here for Fat Tuesday and for a few days after to see New Orleans. The good: Room: quality, cleanliness, frig, coffee and decor. Responsive staff (we needed the tub fixed and towels, both times we had help within 5 minutes) Quick check in, helpful doorman. Continental breakfast is standard fare, fresh and adequate. Bathroom: large and well appointed. The bad: Dogs??? They allow dogs? Although I only heard barking once from our room. Heard a loud barking one day near the elevator. During check-in the staff seemed to have an attitude with us. There was no need for that, but to their credit, spring breaker types were giving them a hard time. But we are not party types so we should not have been given the 'tude, ya know? We had to wear wrist bracelets identifying us as guests. We think this was to keep out the riff-raff during the celebrations. But we had to wear the same bracelet for a few days, kinda strange hey. Overall this was a great place for Mardi Gras, walking distance to everything, yet off to the side so it was quiet. The hotel was in good shape with two PCs for checking email or surfing the web. The breakfast saved us time and money and is of good quality."
POSITIVE,"We were in ohio for a few days, the room was clean, staff friendly, the pool was nice for my daughter, free breakfast. Didnt have any issues, would stay there again"
POSITIVE,"I enjoy the convenience, cleanliness of the hotel and reasonable rates. Donna LePan"
POSITIVE,I liked the location and the free parking - it is annoying when you stay downtown and have trouble with parking. I also liked the beds - very comfy I was hoping it might have a little fridge in the room
POSITIVE,"Awesome hotel. There is a steakhouse right next door with amazing food. There is a deli/convenience store/liquor store all in one on the other side, and strip malls and nauseum through the whole town. I never once felt threatened leaving my hotel, though like with many places near large cities, I wouldn't recommend strolling the alleys at 2am. I stayed here for 11 days straight on business, and I have absolutely no gripes. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"This was a good hotel for the money and proximity to the airport. The breakfast was good, they even had omlets prepared to order. Overall the room was clean."
POSITIVE,"We liked this because it was old-fashioned; all the rooms were on the ground floor, and had exterior doors. This is great for smokers who must go outside a lot. So this was like a little local inn, which I always want to try, but you never know what you might get; but with the Best Western standards and peace of mind. It was quiet when we were there; my husband found a place to sit under an apple tree and smoke, not far from our door. The laundry room was the most extensive I've seen; it is in it's own building and has a whole row of washers and dryers. They lock the door at a definite time - maybe 9 or 10, so I barely made it, because the laundry room was quite busy. The grounds are manicured and there are a few plantings here and there. We liked the way everything was laid out. The room was very nice, smelled good, etc. Nothing to complain about at all. The gals at the front desk were friendly and outgoing, even a little sassy. Would definitely stay here again. Wish there were more like it."
POSITIVE,"Sharon was the one who checked us in,she has a great personailty and was very pleasant to talk with. She made us feel at home. The room was a king and it slept great. We enjoyed our stay and will be going back in Oct. They had a descent breakfast. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
POSITIVE,"Clean, tidy and consistent with Best Western Standards Good selection of breakfast items"
POSITIVE,For an affordable hotel this is it. Very clean rooms and centrally located. We stayed here after our stay at the dollywood cabins. We wanted to stay another night and happened upon this place. Rooms Are quiet.good sheets and comfortable beds. Nothing fancy but I would recommend .
POSITIVE,"We were planning to camp but had to retreat to lodging on short notice because of a massive storm, complete with a tornado watch in effect. This location was perfect for us and a very good value. The front desk staff were all very professional and courteous. The breakfast was average, but sufficiently stocked."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Comfortable bed, nice amenities, work out room, hot tub, over looked the lake. Cons: Air condition air needed updating, carpet had iron print on it."
POSITIVE,"Stopped here on way back from a cross country trip. small town, very quiet. the hotel was very well landscaped, with a nice pool, and a great hot tub. the hot tub could hold 10 people easily and was laid out like a rock pound. the hotel is older but very well taken care of, staff is very friendly. the breakfast was ok. try blondies for dinner. Room Tip: suites are not very exp."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is nice and clean, a little more than we expected from a Best Western hotel in an area like this. The bed is comfortable and the hotel staff is friendly as well. The only possible disappointment is the air con/heater, which is a bit noisy at night. But we certainly will book this hotel again when we come back to this area."
NEUTRAL,"You know what you book when stay at BW Hotels. Clean, Nice Staff and good value. A Bit noisy but have a basic breakfast and a pool. Room is big with refrigerator and microwave. The only complaint we had was take our big luggages and up stairs to 2nd floor without elevator."
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our one night stay at the Best Western Plus in Spring Hill. The lobby and rooms were tastefully decorated and the attentiveness of the staff was top notch. We will be back again when visiting the Spring Hill area.
POSITIVE,We were unable to cool off our room. It was very hot and uncomfortable. The room was very clean and was kept up well. Oue family had several rooms in the motel and they were satisfied too. But all were too hot. Pros: the restraurant was great. Parking was easy. Cons: The temperature of the room was very uncomfortable. Location: It had easy access anywhere in Rochester
POSITIVE,"We do a lot of traveling to the area and choices are limited, however we have never had a bad experience staying here.I guess some people are never happy, but all the employees we have dealt with were very polite and accomodating. Undergoing renovations, but no problems with noise, etc. The breakfast is great and I don't get what people expect from a chain hotel There are fresh waffles, an egg dish, cold cereals, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, etc. The rooms are spotless and the cookies and coffee during the day are a welcome treat. Highly recommend!! Room Tip: Ask for room away from elevator, high floor, although we had no noise whatsoever."
NEGATIVE,"Every morning I was waken up by the house keeping noise. Besides, we got a single though we asked for a double one. The front desk guys are not so polite as expected."
POSITIVE,"If this hotel were anywhere else it'd be double the price. It is in North Hollywood and smack in the middle of a hard working class hispanic neighborhood. I moved my daughter to her apartment that is 1/4 mile away from the property. The neighborhood isnt bad, just different than what one might expect a hotel to be in. Walking around out front at midnight on a weekend night isnt recommended. Yes the hotel could use security but the rooms are clean, the bed was comfortable and I got a good nights sleep. When the kids were little I would not have stayed there. Alone, I was fine and very comfortable. The breakfast is the traditional american free hotel breakfast. Coffee, cereal and breads and juice. Nothing close by to eat really, burgers, donuts, sushi etc..etc.. Nothing worth mentioning. Just an average, clean inexpensive hotel. Only real negative was the cold uncaring attitude of the front desk staff. Room Tip: Try to get rooms on the west side (opposite Lankershim blvd.) Pigeons outside the windows can get an..."
POSITIVE,"The location of the Timber Cove Lodge is simply spectacular. It is literally on the South Lake Tahoe beach. To complete the picture, there is a boat pier extending from the beach, complete with an excellent restaurant at the pier, with a straight view on to the lake and Mt Tallac. The rooms are reasonable for the area and the price range, not particularly good, but also not bad. Our room was somewhat dark, but - with the exception of the carpet, which has seen better days - it was clean. Some rooms on the ground level open up directly onto the beach. This is a great place to come with kids."
POSITIVE,"After three months of eagerly waiting, we finally had a need (an excuse) to pass through Americus again. I was a little apprehensive, thinking that we just got lucky the first time we visited the Windsor. We had the same great hospitality, same great experience as last time. We even ended up with a larger room. This time we had a little more time to explore the town and really loved it. You cannot go wrong staying here. We have even talked to some of our Birmingham relatives about meeting us here for a weekend (halfway)."
POSITIVE,"My family and I stayed there for 2 nights during 4th of july wkend. The hotel was very clean, service was great and the serta beds slept so good. I did not care for the location. No restaurants to eat at had to travel downtown 15 minutes away. But over all the hotel was great."
POSITIVE,"My stay at this hotel was absolutely wonderful. The people at the front desk were very courteous and polite. Walking into the lobby was such a delightful view. The rooms were gorgeous and very clean.Upon my stay breakfast was served each morning,guess what I was able to make my own waffles just like home. Great experience....I""LL BE BACK!!!!"
POSITIVE,"We were extremely happy with the Best Western! The room was extremely nice and clean. They had a good restaurant in the same parking lot for convenience. The view was not the best, but the hotel and staff made it an enjoyable stay."
POSITIVE,"This is a decent hotel, especially if you're on a low budget like we was. They provide a free shuttle bus to most destinations, you just tip the driver which is kushty. Rooms we're nice, came with everything you could ask for including TV's and Hairdryers, I'd recommend. There's an IHOP restaurant next door (International House Of Pancakes) also, briliant for breakfast. And Main St is just down the road, 5 minutes in a cab!"
POSITIVE,"Great for short stay when visiting NYC. Only a few blocks from key attractions. Good price, helpful staff. Had to pay steep price for parking. Fortunately, I had taken the train. Pros: Room small but very clean. Cons: Food service was poor."
POSITIVE,"Helpful staff, reasonable price, and good location. Wallpaper peeling off bathroom walls."
NEUTRAL,"As others have mentioned the staff at this hotel are fantastic, the location is also very useful. Unfortunately my stay was ruined by a large humming sound all night long, I presume this was the air conditioning, but I never could track it down. Other than this though I would have give it 4/5 starts, but had to knock it down to 3 for this problem."
POSITIVE,"place is always clean,which is big plus for me.staff is the best, actually act like they enjoy what there doing and care.i stay in a bunch of motels in my job.this place is on top of my list."
POSITIVE,The staffs were very helpful and nice. Tv is too old.
NEUTRAL,Helpful staff. Older building; but more than adequate if your not looking for the exceptional.
POSITIVE,From Fremont Street to the hotel is an elegant palm-bordered passage way I loved each time I used it. Also the Mexican reastaurant across the street is A -- OK
NEUTRAL,"Very old, the bed was nice. The rest of the room was old and cold. Walls in the hotel are thin. They have a shuttle to the airport just not from the airport. It only runs on the hour, and for 3 people at a time."
POSITIVE,"My daughter and I had a business conference to attend at a Miami airport hotel; we planned to stay 5 nights and wanted to stay at a more affordable hotel near by. I had no idea what a great choice I made selecting this Best Western! We were running very late, so while a few hours out, we called the hotel to let them know we were still on our way; when we arrived, they knew who we were, checked us in quickly, updated us on breakfast hours, WIFI access and gave us directions to the conference hotel that reduced our exposure to rush hour traffic. Our room was a King Suite; it was tastefully decorated and the high ceilings gave it a spacious feel. The sitting area looked like the one in the hotel photos and had a long desk, plenty of power recepts and a large open area that allowed easy access for our suitcases. The kitchenet had a bar type sink, microwave, frig and single cup coffee / tea maker. The FREE hot breakfast was terrific; hot waffels, eggs, bacon or sausage or ham, cereal, yogurt, fresh breads and pastries. This saved us both time and money every day. Now the location, for such a reasonable rate, I didn't expect it would be close to much of anything. Ends up, for our needs, it was close to everything. The conference hotel was less than 5 miles away and everything else was less that 2 miles; Dolphine Mall, International Mall, large grocery and drug stores, all types of American and International restaurants (Peruvian, Argentinian, Korean, Japanese, French, Cuban, Italian, Greek, Brazillian, etc, etc) , fast food and bakeries, gas stations, banks, access to high speed roads (Turnpike, etc), everything we needed. If I have another meeting anywhere near this hotel I will definitely stay there again. I made a Great Choice!"
POSITIVE,"Pulled in for the night in late January, 2012. A bit on the high side ($99 plus tax), but after a long day's drive, I took it. Large bathroom is a big plus!! Relaxed, had a beer down the street, and a great night of sleep. Good breakfast as well."
POSITIVE,"After researching this hotel on line, we were very pleased to find it is all everyone has reviewed previously. Room was very clean, quiet, and spacious. Staff was very accommodating and pleasant to speak with, all smiles and very informative. And the breakfast! Wow! Especially nice was to get a place for dinner that the ""locales"" know and like (The Junkyard). Trusting the advice of more than one receptionist, we ventured to the eatery and had a wonderful dining experience. During conversation at checkin, we indicated our intent to visit the Reagan Library and was immediately provided a discount coupon for the cafe which came in very handy. You can't miss this hotel when in Simi Valley for a nice place to stay. Room Tip: Ask for downstairs on the northwest side or the courtyard (nice view) for the quietest area."
NEUTRAL,"The room was neat and tidy, would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"nice, charming hotel. Unfortunately restaurant doesn't keep up with the good quality of the hotel. Just basic bar food, small wine list, untrained service."
POSITIVE,"Recently I stayed at the beswestern plus in new cumberland. This is one of the nicest hotel in town! I highly recommend staying here. Great rooms, great breakfast, great staff & great service."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel twice now and we can honestly say that it is clean and efficient. The staff are very kind and will go out of their way to make your experience pleasant. They include a free ""breakfast"" in the morning with cereal, juices, waffles, rolls, bagels coffee and fruit. In the evening, they will offer you a free glass of wine as well. Our only disappointment was the pillows. They look nice but were very hard and uncomfortable. Maybe they could add a couple of regular bed pillows ... There is FREE Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. I dinged the grade only for the pillows. Everything else was wonderful. Room Tip: I normally do not pick a room on the first floor because of security reasons. I decided that this was a good, secure hotel and asked for the first floor room and of course, they gave me one."
POSITIVE,"We were very please with the overall experience, from check-in to check-out. Friendly knowledgeable employees. Easy access off of I-15, centrally located for local attractions as well as area attractions. We plan on making this our first choice anytime we are in this area. Appreciate the professionalism as well as effort made in cleanliness and keeping furnishings updated. Front desk staff always standing to greet you, breakfast bar attendants friendly and even saw a gentleman each morning outside sweeping drives and lot. Very impressive."
POSITIVE,"Not a bad place - rooms a bit spacious, water pressure good in shower (important feature!)... Staff freindly and courteous. Only problem is heating/AC unit - cant seem to keep temp in the room stable and kept going on and off all night long. Good location... Room Tip: Stay on top floor away from elevator. Dont stay on the same floor as door to resturant is quite loud when it closes."
POSITIVE,"I would recommend everyone to stay at this hotel! The rooms are clean, and they treat you very well!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is in the South Street Seaport area and is within walking distance of all downtown neighborhoods. Our room had a great terrace and view of the East River and Brooklyn Bridge. We had dinner in Soho and walked back to the hotel. It was quiet, well staffed, free wifi, and continental breakfast. We even parked overnight for $20. I prefer downtown because it feels like NYC and is far less congested than midtown. This hotel also has lots of good deals so it's a find in NYC. Did I mention the tasty cookies in the mid-afternoon? Or the fabulous Italian wine store around the corner? They are doing construction on Peck's Slip but we were here on the weekend and had no noise. They are also refacing the front of the hotel, so if you are planning a weekday trip, might be worth asking about whether those factors will impact your stay. The Fulton Street subway is about a 15 minute walk."
POSITIVE,Price within budget. Service was just as good. Location was only 2-3 miles from stone mountain.
NEUTRAL,Location and ease of access. Housekeeping and lack of room supplies.
NEGATIVE,well i called into book a room and explained i needed a room close to the front desk and preferably on the first floor for my 89 yr old grandmother and i advised if they could not accomidate that do they have a wheelchir that we could use to wheel her to the room they advised yes i will have one available for her use so i went to check in later that afternoon and to my surprise hey did not have a wheelchair for my grandmothers use well needless to say i had to wheel my grandmother up to our room on a luggage kart well needless to say my grandmother was stuck in the room for the rest of the night and my wife went shopping for our children at the mall across the road and went to buy clothes for our children and she came back and the kids were in the overly crowded way above max compacity pool well the pool was closed but we could hear people yelling still in the pool area well it ws 8 guys and 2 woman drunk off there -- playing on the kiddie slides in the 3ft water side of the pool and needless to say we were on the 3rd floor and we could hear them like they were next door well the next morning my wife went to the car to bring some bags out to the car our CAR WAS BROKEN INTO THEY STOLE 2 PORTABLE DVD PLAYERS 2 TOUCHSCREEN IPODS AND ALL THE CLOTHES MY WIFE BOUGHT FOR THE KIDS ABOUT 400 DOLLARS IN CLOTHES AND YES THE DOORS WERE LOCKED so we asked the hotel if they had any cameras they advised no so we call the police and they come and do a ivestigation and police report for our insurance nd the front desk did not even say sorry for your loss and for your grandmother having to use that luggae kart not a care in the world and i just now called the manager today febuary 15 the and he did not as much as ask me whom i was my name or phone number all he old me was he would look into it well we filled out a incident report and decided today to call because noone from the hotel even bothered to call us we stayed there on friday febuary 10th 2012 very dissatisfied! AND I HAVE PICTURES OF MY GRANDMOTHER ON THE LUGGAGE KART i personally think RAMKOTA NEEDS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT ND NOT IGNORE IT! Room Tip: dont park by door 7 criminals roam that side of hotel!
POSITIVE,"I found this location by chance and I'm really glad I did. The lbby was very nice and the staff was excellent, even though I arrived pretty late at night. The room was just great. It has more of an apartment feel than a typical hotel room. I slept great in the big king sized bed. Good water pressure in the shower ( room 108). Breakfast was really good, and great coffee. I will definitely stay again. Room Tip: The room I stayed in was very quiet."
NEUTRAL,The rooms are nice but the management are rude. No ice machines or vending on third floor. No tv guide or channel viewer. The parking is not convienent. The motel is just no up to best western standards.
POSITIVE,"Good location, comfortable safe place to spend a week visiting family"
POSITIVE,The location being near to the airport. The breakfast was excellent. The shuttle was quick and friendly and helpfull. The room was clean and quiet. Wish there had been a resturant besides another motel down the street.
POSITIVE,"We recently stayed at the Best Western in Dubuque, IA and our stay was wonderful! The staff was very polite, friendly and helpful. The room was VERY clean and nice! We have stayed at hotels in the surrounding area as well and this is by far the best in town! The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were AMAZING! Our kids got a gift basket full of stuff, pool toys, coloring activities, bubbles, water bottles, treats, and much much more, they loved it! We also got tickets to the River Museum with our stay which was nice because the river museum is wonderful, but kind of pricey. We also got pizza from Chammps attached to the hotel, with our room package, which was delivered to our room with pop and it was very good and the gentleman that brought it was very polite! I noticed some of the reviews had a problem with a smell, but I thought the room smelled quite nice. I would highly recommend this hotel if staying in the Dubuque IA area! Room Tip: The rooms that are poolside will be noisy until 11 so if you are planning on an early night then choose a room that is not poolside"
POSITIVE,Nice for the price. Breakfast was great!
POSITIVE,my stay was nice. loved the indoor pool. kimberly was helpful
NEUTRAL,"Large rooms, near airport. We could not print boarding passes any where in the hotel."
POSITIVE,This was a much needed getaway. Upon arrival we were greeted by your friendly staff then we noticed the decor was beautiful and very inviting. Your facility is beautiful and we are planning on returning in December we look forward to returning to your Hotel and to the area.Thanks for a really nice time.
POSITIVE,It was amazing. everything was great would definitly stay there again
NEGATIVE,"The location was ideal, close to most tourist attractions and to main shopping areas. Decent size bathroom, although jacuzzi bath was broken. We were travelling with our 3 young children and they gave us a smoking room, everything smelt of smoke which was awful- putting on the ac only made it worse. The hotel was full so we could not move rooms.The sofa bed for the kids was very uncomfortable and noisy (squeaky). Very noisy neighbours, walls paper thin. Not ideal for families."
POSITIVE,"Location location on this one - just a block or two from the Walk of Fame. Great views of the Hollywood sign from nearby shopping mall (don't drive around for hours like my husband and I did trying to get a better shot - this was by far the best view). Price was a little steep for a Best Western, but competative rate considering it was in Hollywood. There is a small bistro on site that serves basic but tasty snack food which was reasonably priced. Parking is premium in Hollywood and there was ample room in the parking lot for no extra charge. The room was clean, quiet and pretty spacious - this was the ideal stopover for one night passing through on our way to Vegas."
POSITIVE,I stay in Best Western in Lock Heaven appx 28 day a month. It is truely home away from home for me. I always have best service from the staff. From the time I check in to check out the staff is there for everyone. I never heard anyone complain about anything. I will always stay here.
POSITIVE,"What a pleasant surprise it was to arrive at this hotel. The staff was courteous and efficient, and check in was a breeze. It was a pleasant surprise to look out the large window of our ocean view 6th floor room and see the beautiful sand dunes. I had been to Newport and Nye beach countless times, but I had not walked down far enough to see them. The pool was warm and inviting, the service was wonderful, the beds were comfortable, and the atmosphere was relaxing. We ate in the bar and watched the sun set over the ocean. The food and sevice was wonderrful there, too. I would definitely return! Thanks for the menories. Room Tip: I'd always ask for an ocean view. It made the experience incredible!"
POSITIVE,Even though we live 30 minutes away we stayed here in July for my Brother's wedding in Listowel. The hotel was really nice and the breakfast was fantastic!!
POSITIVE,"It was a nice, clean, comfortable hotel at a reasonable price. We were well-located and could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The breakfast was very nice for a continental breakfast. It was a big noisy but it was in the downtown area. We wanted that so we have no reason to complain about noise as downtown usually equals a bit of noise."
NEUTRAL,"No weather stripping around the door and the interstate noise was so loud it sounded like the door was wide open! There were gummy bears stuck to the carpet from some previous guest and I found it when I stepped on it!! YUK! Price was good, breakfast was good and hotel was convenient."
POSITIVE,"pretty decent, clean, convenient location and have a Chinese restaurant very closed by!"
POSITIVE,"Very nice weekend. Surprised at traffic this time of year. All staff, propriators ect friendly & helpful."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was nice , the location was even better . I would stay again."
POSITIVE,"I was initially wowed by the location-- the Inn is very close to the Cobleskill shopping areas but the Inn sits on top of a hill that has breathtaking views of the valley. Then I was wowed by the hospitality -- the ladies at the front desk were incredibly friendly and cheerful! We felt instantly relaxed and comfortable. Then I was further wowed by the rooms - clean as a whistle and very comfortable. Then, believe it or not, I was wowed by the restaurant! The views are beautiful and the food was great (and affordable). The rooms are a little on the small side-- roomy enough for two double sized beds and nice furniture. If you're looking for a penthouse suite with king-sized beds, go to Albany, but expect to pay 3x more. The rates here at Best Western Inn are excellent, some of the best I've seen in Upstate New York. It's a nice place to stay if you are going to Howe Caverns or SUNY Cobleskill. It's also nice to stay if you're on the way to Albany, as hotels in Albany are twice or three times more costly there. My favorite part was the early morning. We got up to watch the sun rise and the morning mist slowly rose from the Schoharie hills. It was just so beautiful beyond words. PROS: Amazing views. Good rates. Lots to do (swimming, bowling, shopping). Free WiFi Internet. Free newspaper. Restaurant has least expensive food around. AMAZING staff. Rooms very home-y and comfortable. CONS Parking area noise can be heard in rooms at the front of hotel. Decor is a little dated. Only double-sized beds available (that's all I could find, anyway). In the winter, it can be rough driving through the area. Note: I wrote more extensively about our stay on my blog NewYorkTraveler.net. I did receive a free overnight stay in exchange for my blog review, and all opinions are completely honest and genuinely mine. Room Tip: If you want a super-quiet room without hearing noise from the parking area, ask for a room in the back."
NEUTRAL,"I always stay at the Best Western whenever I travel to Monte Vista or surrounding towns. Monte Vista is a small town that doesn't see a multitude of travelers. But there is one constant in accommodations - Kelloff's Best Western. I've seen many hotels and motels come and go, but Kelloff's Best Western has remained for a reason. The staff is courteous, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and if you're there during the warmer months, you can watch a drive-in movie from your room. Their restaurant offers good old American fare at a good price."
POSITIVE,"Complimentary breakfast and shuttle pick up at the room.In addition, room service from the dining room."
NEUTRAL,"Very clean and comfortable. Elevator was slow, but still worth the price."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was very nice and close to many amenities and Attraction Parks like Universal Studio Parks. A 20 minute drive to Disney World. I enjoyed staying at The Best Western in Orlando, Florida. I would definitely stay there again. The staff were all friendly."
POSITIVE,Great stay. All employees were friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay again. Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
NEGATIVE,Smell of chlorine and cleaning product Did you find this review helpful? yes no Share: twitter â¢ facebook
POSITIVE,This Best Western made the work we had to do in town much easier to deal with. Our room was very comfy and having a window that opens was very nice. The staff was always very helpful and courteous. The breakfast area was nicely stocked with a nice selection of items and clean. The laundry room was clean and worked well also. We highly recommend it.
POSITIVE,Deluxe continental breakfast made the difference. Very nice selection and well kept by staff. Thanks
POSITIVE,"Very nice, comfortable stay. Not luxurious, but well maintained, clean, I think very good value overall."
POSITIVE,"Good location, good price, service with a smile."
POSITIVE,Very clean ; friendly staff; excellent location and loved the two beds in the room Nothing really
POSITIVE,I have a big family and a small budget this is a great hotel for the price and the service is great.My kids left out thereipod and tablet out in the open i was scared it would be gone but the room was cleaned and everything was still there.
POSITIVE,"Traveled to Colorado Springs for first time to visit my son @ Peterson AFB. This hotel had good prices and was represented as being close to the base. Turned out to be further than expected but not that bad. Room was fine, bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. Two people could not fit in it at the same time. Staff was very accomodating."
POSITIVE,Hotel was nice and clean. Staff wasnt the friendliest. Could benefit them to have their employees take a course in customer service.
NEUTRAL,"Close to Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-cola. Close to metro station. Room was clean, breakfast was adequate. Staff was friendly. Wireless internet connection was fast enough."
POSITIVE,Just a wonderful place to visit.
POSITIVE,"Great value hotel in la jolla, convenient location"
NEUTRAL,"room was clean and tidy when we got there. Was barely touched the next day. Beds were not remade properly and even though we moved al of our belongings to a corner no cleaning was done. Empty pizza box left, no vaccuming, etc."
POSITIVE,"Best price, good complete breakfast. We have been on the road (just retired) for two months and wish we could find a motel like this more often."
POSITIVE,"We stayed two nights in October 2011 and we can only say good things from this motel. The management and the service was excellent. The room was large and clean, the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast menu is much more then the usual continental breakfast. Thank you BEST WESTERN LAMPLIGHTER INN."
POSITIVE,"The full breakfast was very good! Also appreciated the availability to juice and coffee all day(and night) . Staff hospitality was amazing.The shuttle service was prompt, and the vehicles were clean. We plan to stay again. Very comfortable beds and pillows too!"
NEUTRAL,"The room was nice and the bed comfortable. Nice 42"" tv. Basic hotel, continental breakfast. It was fine for a one night stay. The front desk staff was NOT helpful and argumentative."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is perfect if you just need a clean, comfortable place for an overnight. There's not much around, but there IS a bike trail right behind the hotel that goes along the river and is a great morning walk. (There are some homeless encampments, so not recommended for after dark.) The place seems to have been remodeled recently since I don't remember [?] it being this nice the last time I stayed. They have an excellent continental breakfast with cereals, juices, and more than just pastries."
NEUTRAL,The manager of the sunday Breakfast Buffet Needs lots of help in customer service and not to talk them down. exspecially when the customers where right.
NEGATIVE,Poor customer service; not a good value; will not stay here again
POSITIVE,"I would stay in this Hotel again, only real problem is the parking situation! Had to end up going to a third different parking garage just to find a place to park for the night. Other than that had a great stay."
NEUTRAL,"Booked this hotel via one of the bidding websites for just a tad over $100, and was upgraded to the suite upon arrival. The rooms was large, spacious, and very clean. That said, it is still a Best Western, so don't expect too much with the Premier tag. The heated pool outside was fun even with the fall breeze. The only downside is the loud noise from the trucks and buses that are constantly driving on the highway, especially during the busy harvest seasons (Late summer to Fall). Unless you're a deep sleeper, you'll be interrupted a few times during the night. I probably wouldn't pay the full listed price, but if you can get it for cheaper, it's a nice hub to visit the wineries. Room Tip: We were on the very western end, and it was still a bit loud at night. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Great service and awesome breakfast.
NEUTRAL,Location
NEUTRAL,"Great location, breakfast, shutttle and price. It is getting older and needs a lot of updating"
NEUTRAL,A bit too expensive for what you get
NEGATIVE,"We booked the hotel based on the information provided on the web-site: the hotel is NOT located 17 miles from any Yosemite National Park entrance, it is located 37 miles from the park entrance. The TV in the room didn't work, nor did the alarm clock. The Continental Breakfast was the worst we ever encountered anywhere. The Front Desk Clerk during check [?] out in the morning was not helpful in any way, didn't have the time to answer a couple of questions."
NEGATIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times when diving in the area. The dunes and beach across the street attracted us rather than the hotel. We stayed this weekend and decided it would be our last. While the staff is always friendly and helpful, the hotel is in need of some TLC and maids who know how to clean. Each time we have stayed, it seems like the rooms are never cleaned to standard. This stay the towels were dirty gray (like they were used to clean something really dirty) and the travel lotion was half-used. Additionally, as others have reported, there was hair in the sink and the springs in the bed popped a few times while we slept (or tried to sleep). It is a bit of a noisy hotel and the walls are thin, so you hear, showers, kids, etc. We will miss the pretty beach but not this run down hotel. Room Tip: Don't stay in room # 135 - it is next to the stairwell and extremely noisy and grossly dirty!!! The rooms in the courtyard that overlook the pool are in better shape than the rooms that face the north parking lot."
POSITIVE,"A litte out of town, and don't let the exterior fool you. The rooms are great - super comfortable beds, the service is phenomenal from everyone, nice pool, jacuzzie and one of the best fitness rooms I have seen in a hotel! Add to that a great view and peaceful atmosphere. Even the food was great - room service in less than 15 minutes! There were two weddings the weekend we were there and we didn't hear a thing once we closed the door to our room. I travel for work a lot as well - it doesn't get much better than this! Big thank yous to all the staff at the hotel who made our stay both fun and relaxing! Room Tip: The rooms at the back have a great view of the NorWesters. Really nice!"
NEUTRAL,"Standard Best Western rooms. Staff were quite expressionless and not helpful. Bathroom was a little outdated. If you intend to make use of shuttle, call ahead to front desk. We were intending on using shuttle at 6am, got there at 5:55 and it was gone. Had to wait anoter half hour. If you can afford a few more bucks, go with the Marriott. Room Tip: Double check what type room - as a couple, we were assigned double beds. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This was our first time at this Best Western. When I made the reservation over the phone the staff person was friendly,nice, kind, and very helpful. When we arrived at the Best Western the staff was even more helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast had lots of variety of breakfast food and drinks. Our stay was very enjoyable and we would highly recommend it."
NEUTRAL,Not hotwire 3 star like they say. Good for quick cheap overnight stay. Clean. Older neighborhood.
NEUTRAL,"This is not a bad hotel, but you do not get what you pay for. This hotel is located on the edge of lower middle class neighborhood in Corvallis. It is right next to the Motel 6, and another lower end hotel. It is near a Trader Joe's supermaket, a discount clothing store (Marshall's I think) and a few other businesses. It is right near 9th street, but not on it. This hotel looks to have once been a lower end hotel that was ""spruced up"" by installing decorative pillars, some balconies, and a large fancy overhang where the front entry way is located. Inside the hallways all of the rooms have fancy decorative pillar like entries around the doors, too, to make the hotel more fancy than it is. Beyond this decorative stuff, it is just your basic generic hotel. The rooms are very large, which is both good and bad. Good in the fact you can stretch out. Bad in the fact that the 32 inch tv is too far away to see from the beds. In addition, since the rooms are large and shaped like an ""L"" and the tv is off to the side of one bed instead of at the feet of the bed. The rooms are equiped with tv, two tables, 4 chairs, 2 beds, fridge, iron, hair dryer, coffee pot, etc. Not bad. Bathroom was normal size, but had cheap fiberglass tub and cheap surround around the tub. The vanity area was average and ok. The room could have been cleaner. The corner areas and hard to reach parts had not been cleaned in awhile. There was an accumulation of soil in these area. There was some hair on the box springs and matress. However, the sheets and comforter were clean. The hotel offers a decent hotel breakfast. Sausages, eggs, waffles, cereal, biscuits and gravy, yogurt, fruit, etc. It was a decent breakfast; I have seen better, and I have seen worse. The hotel has an outdoor pool that is open during the summer months only. Overall not a bad hotel, but not worth the $100.00+/night price tag. What you are paying for is their ""decorative fancy"" upgrades to try and make this hotel in to something that it is not. I would expect to pay more like 60-70 dollars/night for what I got instead.

POSITIVE,My parents love to stay here when they visit for the holidays or any other special events. Keep up the great work Best Western Center Inn.
POSITIVE,"We stayed once before at this hotel, probably 18 years ago as a splurge and I had remembered it fondly but hadn't considered it in recent years because I assumed it would be too expensive. My mistake! I've spent most of my life traveling the hour and change to the Lancaster area to visit the outlets, buy our christmas trees (get them at the lovely farmhouse thats next to the Fulton Steamboat Inn on route 30), go shopping, and take friends around on tours. Since my husand and I got married we've gone at least once and sometimes twice or more a season to the PA Rennisance Fair which admittedly a bit of a drive in Manheim but we typically stay down on Route 30 anyway because its cheaper, and there are more places to eat and shop. For our latest Renn Faire trip I decided to try the Best Western Revere Inn & Suites again since it seemed to have the best mix of good reviews and reasonable prices for the Saturday night in question. I think people tend to forget that weekends in the fall are still high tourist season for the Lancaster area and have a bit of sticker shock, after all I'm practically a native and I did. Still for the price paid the room delievered on all of its promises. Clean and comfy with adequate furniture, nice bed linens and towels, free wifi, free breakfast, a fridge and a coffee maker. We stayed in the annex which does not appear to have an elevator to the 2nd floor, and has doors that open to exterior walkways for those of you who that matters to. We managed to lug our weekend gear up to the room but if I'd had a family's worth of suitcases I'd have made sure to request a room on the first floor in that building. You could hear the traffic noise, and sometimes when they threw out trash from the Revere Inn, but once the ac/heat was on I didn't notice it anymore and it didn't disrupt my sleep. Each of our beds had 4 pillows to sleep on, plus a decorative one which I believe may be a hotel record for me. Breakfast the next morning was the usual crowded scene but I expect that on a weekend. Both my husband and I felt it was a very nice breakfast for ""free"", I had coffee which was adequate, a waffle which was more then adequate and some cranberry juice. My husband had 2 breakfast sandwiches and some yogurt. I also saw mixed fruit, various danishes and coffee cakes, cereal, the usual toastable items with appropriate spreads and hard boiled eggs. Since I was about to spend the day at the Renn Fare laced in a steel-boned corset I didn't sample as much of the breakfast as I'd have liked to. Even late in the breakfast the selection was quite good and being restocked continuously. Room Tip: If you have lots of luggage try to avoid the 2nd floor of the annex because of the stairs. Although its possible I missed the elevator when we arrived, but I sure didn't see one."
NEGATIVE,"While the price is fairly low at $72, the room smells of 'old bedroom.' Hotel needs to invest in modern de-odorizers that hotels use to get rid of the smell of humans. Breakfast buffet is a joke, with limited offerring in a crude set up. Pretty off-putting when the 350 lb. desk clerk is sitting in there with you, pawing at his laptop screen at 6:30 in the morning. All in all, its not a place where I would stay again. Room Tip: There's no help available at this place."
POSITIVE,This hotel was built in 2000 but looks like it is brand new. Our room looked out on the Salmon river. Get a room that does that it is really worth it. The staff was very nice and very helpful.
NEUTRAL,1. Don't take a room at the second floor if you have heavy luggage. 2. Don't a room with windows near the highway. 3. Location difficult if you come from East to West. Staff not so friendly at the reception.
POSITIVE,"Excellent value, stayed for 5 nights and was very impressed with how responsive the staff was. Very help, great pool, bar and good breakfast. Would absolutely recommend staying here."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is supposed to be a Best Western Plus, which Best Western states meets the requirements for a 3-diamond rating from AAA. In fact, AAA only rates it 2-diamond. Also, at the time I booked it, Priceline had it listed as a 3-star hotel. They have since downgraded it to 2.5 stars. This hotel is a 2-star/diamond at best. The rooms are small, the beds are small (doubles, not queens), everything has a cheap look and feel to it, the front-desk staff are poorly trained, and from what I saw, the reservation system is clunky and prone to mistakes (I was in line for over 15 minutes to check in, during which time two people in front of me had problems with their reservations). That being said, the room was clean, and although the beds were not the best I've ever slept on, they weren't terrible either. Also, the free breakfast is really decent (but overcrowded) and the pool looked nice although I didn't use it. Free WI-fi works well but is unsecured. Also, this is one of the less expensive hotels in the area. For this reason, I can recommend it, but only if you just want a place to crash for the night and price is your absolute top priority. If you will be spending a lot of time in the hotel, or you need a lot of space or just prefer nicer/updated decor, then I would look elsewhere. Room Tip: This hotel has smoking rooms, so be sure to request non-smoking if you need it."
POSITIVE,"My finance I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, the room and bathroom facilities were spacious and very clean. Both the main restaurant and the sports bar served delicious food. The continental breakfast was not the best but it served its purpose. The main restaurant was a bit pricey however the food was well worth the price. The location of the hotel [?] is very close to the canyon, would highly recommend this to young couples and families."
POSITIVE,"The razor-sharp receptionist of a certain age is still there, but retiring soon, I was told, which is sad, because she was one of several pleasant surprises during our recent one-night (And it said volumes about the wisdom of keeping senior citizens active in the workforce, but I digress.) Traveling with our small dog, who (as in another Knoxville hotel earlier in our road trip) was well received - our pet friendly room (which looked exactly like the double seen in the photos here) was down the hall from the lobby, next to an exit door -- handy for quick walks at night. The immediate neighborhood is the usual unassuming off-Interstate collection of franchise businesses, but there is a good supermarket next door, and the well-rated Puleo's Grill is a short walk away. Bonus points for our room not having that sickly antiseptic smell that we sometimes encounter at other roadside hotels. I'd stay again."
POSITIVE,Great deal and locale. Easy to get everywhere. Service was very polite and we were pleasantly surprised with the free breakfast actually being good. Not just a bagel and juice. A good bit of hipper places close as an alternative to just downtown country district. The bar is no longer but it's a small hotel with lots of places a short walk and/or drive.
NEUTRAL,"We booked this hotel because they allowed pets and it's proximity to vernon city centre. We where not informed of the $15 nightly charge for the solo dog that we had and we where suprised at the amount upon arrival. we we're very shocked at the other guests on our floor allowing thier very rowdy children to play in the corridors and even more shocked at the alcohol drinking by the adults in the corridors. they felt that it was thier right to be in the corridors, even if it meant upsetting the other guests!"
NEUTRAL,"THe best part about the hotel was the staff, the pool, and being smoke free. Other wise I would not stay there again. It did not smell good and breakfast was horrible. Thank goodness for Cracker Barrel nearby."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable, staff was very friendly, just outside city proper. I'd recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"After having spent the better part of a week looking for accommodations that wouldn't break the bank, I settled on the Best Western Classic Inn. After having read so many strikingly negative reviews of other ""budget friendly"" places in the area, this was a pleasant surprise. Located right off the highway next to the Ohio border, it was close to a number [?] of convenient dining choices, and basically anything a traveler might need. I found the room here was surprisingly clean and comfortable for the price. I was especially pleased with how clean the linens and towels were in addition to lots of fluffy pilllows. It was also a nice touch to come back to the room each day with a note from housekeeping hoping I was enjoying my stay. Even though the continental breakfast was just okay, this will be the first place I look for availability should I have a need to stay in the area again!"
POSITIVE,The only down side was the breakfast was not very good.....
POSITIVE,The staff were fantasticthe girls at the front counter could not have been more helpfulltruly appreaciate their friendly and full of information for your stay.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here the week of October 3rd. This was a great commute to the Kentucky Fairgrounds where I had a trade show. The breakfast was great, the rooms were spacious and clean and hotel staff was great. A tip though is that when I was there the bridges are under construction which causes major delays...I would stay here again no questions asked!"
POSITIVE,We arrived Aug. 12 . It was the first night of a 14 day motorcycle trip. We were very road weary and ready to stop for the day. The room was large and comfortable. We were pleased with the refrigerator/microwave in the room. The staff were the most helpful and friendliest of our entire trip . We tend to stay at Best Western or Hampton Inns. Pool was clean and clear. The breakfast was nice and we enjoyed the home baked breads. It was apparent that they work hard to please a sometimes difficult public.
NEUTRAL,"No issues with the room, service or location, but nothing outstanding. Staff was friendly and the room was clean and the location was fine, but no wow factor. We got the room from priceline with name your price. I would not have paid the full price. But again the all was good. Room Tip: AC was a bit noisy, but it cooled so all was good."
POSITIVE,"There are few selections and few differences, but the staff here make this hotel stand out. Very friendly and will go out of their way to make sure that not just your hotel experience is great, but your whole time in Whitehorse is!"
NEUTRAL,"Upon check in the woman at the front desk informed us of a situation they had had earlier that evening. She booked a couple into a room that someone else was already staying in. Can imagine their surprise upon walking into a room with people already in bed. She blamed it on the person from the prior shift. Okay, glad that person was not there when we arrived. We get our check in, two room for two nights and the rate, all set or so we thought. The next morning, we found she had only booked them for one night each. When they re-booked for the second night, they charged a higher amount than quoted. Our companions card was bill, credited and re-billed. My card supposedly was only to be charged the correct amount, NOT. It took three days to have my money released back to my debit card. In all fairness, the room was clean and quiet."
POSITIVE,"It's the old Hampton, still run by the owner of the over-priced Hampton across the street and obviously held to the same standards. Highly recommended."
POSITIVE,glood hotel clean and with good room sizes. poor breakfast witout near restaurants.
POSITIVE,I have stayed here numerous times over the last couple of years and have been pleased with the consistency of cleanliness and service. I will continue to stay here when I go to the Famoso drag race events.
NEUTRAL,"I was exhausted from road travels, so it was frustrating to find that my toilet wouldn't flush when I arrived. It turned out that I needed to turn the valve that had been shut that provided water to the toilet's reservoir. I also only received one bar of soap, so I had to use it for both the sink and shower...a slight inconvenience. It was an average hotel with an average price, but a convenient locations."
NEUTRAL,"i was on a motorcycling-fall-foliage-tour, solo, but had 2-Harley's on a trailer, so, I booked through the HarleyOwnersGroup website, for the ""discount"", for wich i didn't get, of course. No-smoking in the rooms, no fridge or micro in the room, and, very limited food/restaurants close-by. didn't have the ""complimentary""breakfast, but, did enjoy the fresh-lobby coffee, several-times. this was an ""off-peak"" time for the hotel, as they were no-where near capacity,so, i had plenty of space to park my truck&trailer,and, 2-bikes, no-hassles. the staff made this place bearable, they're genuine friendliness, and, helpful, accomodating service made-up for the lack-of the simple amenities that EVERY hotel in this price-range should have. Did i mention that everyone spoke english ? the hotel owner/operator knows he's the only game in town, so, he charges as much as he wants,,,i'd do the same... Room Tip: request a room that faces the courtyard/pool"
NEUTRAL,"SHORT VERSION Very convenient location, adequate room, and mostly helpful staff. There may be better places to stay that provide better value, but sometimes location makes the higher price worth it. LONG VERSION The reviews citing an average rating for this hotel accurately portray my experience and I give it an average rating as well. Please note that this was my first trip to SFO and so I cannot offer any guidance as to whether this hotel is any better or worse than any other hotel in the same area. We paid $200/night not including taxes, etc. A few quirks throughout our stay but nothing that caused me concern or necessitated a call to the front desk or manager. Our room was on the outside wall facing Mason St. As other reviews have pointed out, probably the worst attribute about this hotel is the noise from outside which is pretty powerful and at times annoying. It is worse on weekends than during the week, but there are various distractions all the time such as busses, loud cars, people yelling, and across the street is a parking garage for a small mall that has a buzzer to warn pedestrians every time a car is coming out of it. We can't reasonably hold this against the hotel especially since the entire wharf area is a very busy place and traffic noise should be expected. However, all of this noise could likely be dampened if the hotel modernized its windows (see photos) which at least in our room were in serious need of replacement. If you can deal with âwhite noiseâ, we found that the air conditioner created enough of it to drown out the noise from outside. Unfortunately there was no âfan onlyâ option on the AC unit, only cool and heat, which meant that when the room reached whatever temperature you set it at the unit shut off and there was the street noise again. A better solution would be to set the TV on a âstaticâ station and at a volume that would take care of the street noise. If you canât survive with âwhite noiseâ or street noise, the best advice Iâve seen from other reviews is to specifically request an INSIDE room. The room itself was adequate size with a King bed, bureau, TV (not flat screen or HD), desk, two chairs, closet, and adequate sized bathroom. Iâve read other reviews stating the rooms are small; however they are not any smaller than most other hotels I have stayed at. We found there was plenty of room to move around and did not feel boxed in. They certainly are not suites, but they are not shoeboxes either. Regarding other reviews that claim the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything your neighbors do, we did not experience this. The entry doors to the rooms however are close to each other and are somewhat noisy. We could hear our neighbors entering and leaving their room (and Iâm sure they could hear us), but we never heard them once they were inside their room. Perhaps they were just quiet neighbors. The bathroom was in very good condition except for some mold we found on the ceiling (see photo), and there was plenty of hot water for showers. On one occasion the ballcock on the toilet did not close and I had to lift the tank cover and reseat it. Not a big deal and otherwise no problems with the bathroom or hot water. The AC/heating unit in our room looked new (see photo) and worked flawlessly. We found the hotel staff mostly friendly and helpful. Iâm not sure if they call them doormen or bellhop anymore, but a young man named Matt was great and stands out from the rest of the hotel employees. My only real complaint is that the concierge service is lacking with only one person available. Someone got to her before us and kept her busy for the better part of an hour. We only wanted to know what bus to take to the Golden Gate Bridge so asked someone at the front desk who sort of knew, but didnât really know, and ultimately told us to ask the young lady who was acting as concierge. Well she was still busy with the other couple who got to her before us, so we found our own way. Overall, we found the staff was pleasant, professional, and helpful. The room cleaning service was very good except for the last day. We went out touring around and came back around 1pm tired. My wife has a medical condition and needed to rest but the maid was just getting around to our room. We went down into the lobby and sat there for about 30 minutes then went upstairs to check our room again, and the maid was just finishing up. As we opened the door we found we had a rollaway bed in our room, which was interesting since we never requested one. We assumed that perhaps the next occupant of the room had requested it and the hotel had just brought it early. We asked the maid about it who seemed surprised that WE were surprised to see it there, and quickly removed it. We laid on the bed to take a nap and about 5 minutes later some other maid opened the door without knocking and asked if we had a bath-mat. I looked and said we did and she closed the door. About 10 minutes later some male opened our door without knocking and when he saw us inside said âwhoops, sorryâ and closed the door. I still donât know if it was a hotel employee coming into the room for some reason or if the maid had not closed the door tightly and someone just went to the wrong room and was able to open the door. While my wife was very annoyed that two people had opened our room door and invaded our privacy, I felt no harm doneâ¦we were dressed and just resting but it were certainly a very weird series of events. Lesson hereâ¦LOCK your door from the inside if you REALLY want privacy. The hotel has a restaurant which we tried once for breakfast, but we found the service lacking and did not return. We were seated promptly but it took a while for the waiter to approach us. I ordered a coffee and got oneâ¦and only one. Our breakfast was simple and directly off the menu but it took longer to serve than we thought it should. Having finished my first cup of coffee and almost done my meal, I was ready for another coffee (or ANYTHING to drink) but our waiter was either not to be found, or busy keeping his back to us so that I couldnât get his attention. Unable to delay any longer, I flagged down another waiter and asked if he would please get me a glass of water, which he did promptly. There is an IHOP a block down the road with impeccable service and so we ate breakfast there the rest of the week for half the price of the hotel restaurant. Wireless internet access was available free in the room and worked fine. There are two elevators and both worked fine, relatively quickly, and we experienced no crowding or lines for them. Longest wait for an available elevator was about 30 seconds, and most times we had the elevator to ourselves. We found the bed mattress and pillows very comfortable and slept very well. I would classify the mattress as firm, although it had a soft top layer on it. There are a few things I do take issue with regarding the hotel which caused me to rate it only average and I leave it to the reader to make up their own mind of their importance. First, I think a $200/night hotel in the 21st century should have High Def TVâs in the room, not outdated CRT models with only 10 or so channels available. This is one of those things that is a tip off the hotel is not investing in its own infrastructure which can sometimes point to larger issues with the hotel. A $200/night hotel also should not have mold in the bathroom (see photo) or have door hinge pins coming out (see photo). These are minor maintenance issues, easily identified and fixed, the occurrence of which also suggests the hotel is not investing money in its infrastructure. Think of it, all it takes is for housecleaning or maintenance staff to carefully inspect each room between occupants. At most, a five minute room go-around with a checklist is all that is required. Mold especially is a no-no, and shame on Best Western for not identifying and fixing the mold in this room before making it available for occupancy. A $200/night hotel also should not have windows in the condition we found them (see photos). Not only did it not close tight, but the handle was not firmly attached and came off in my hand whenever trying to crank the window open or closed. A tightly sealed window would help cut down on the outside traffic noise and make for happier customers. The window condition is another suggestion that the hotel is not investing in its own infrastructure and simply trying to extract as much profit out of the existing building as possible. In summary, the hotel is adequate but value is debatable. Management could easily increase the sense of value by performing simple maintenance inspections and investing in the infrastructure. There are many hotels in the same area that might provide better value. Room Tip: Seek inside room if you can't sleep with street noise. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This was an older hotel, but was clean, the rooms were large, and for the price,you won't beat it. Good breakfast thrown in for free too! I highly recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Located next to I 95 and with other motels and restaurants. Rooms are decent and adequate. Service good. Breakfast basic but not cleanliness not uncomfortable. Overall a decent value for $57.21. Check-in: August 5, 2011 Check-out: August 6, 2011 Room Tip: Always ask to see another room if your not happy"
NEGATIVE,i recently booked a king room in best western and on the night i arrived it was around 9:30 and the parking lot was full i went to check in and got into my room and it was a double room so i went down to front desk and she told me they gave my room to some one else and they cant upgrade me because they were booked so i told her to send me to the hotel [?] they owned next door with a upgraded room and when they did it was a broken hot tub in the room and it used to be a smokers room and it smelt terrible so i went down to switch rooms and after a long wait i finally got a room that was still far from good. worst experience in a long time but at least its something i will remember
POSITIVE,the hotel was very clean. the staff were great the only disappointment I had was that I did not knwo ahead of time that they do in fact have a swimming pool... so I had to run out and buy the kids bathing suits so they could go for a swim but other than that it was great!! We will most certainly go back if we are back that way!!
POSITIVE,"We had the most wonderful time in Bowery Hanbee, where we stayed for a week last June. Lovely hosts, spatious rooms, clean and tidy furnishing, great beds, good air conditioning. The hotel is perfectly located for easy access to Soho, East Village, Little Italy and, of course, Chinatown. Great value for money. We will be back!"
NEGATIVE,"it was close to the convention center the beds were comfortable The front desk staff was rude and aggressive. They did not make me feel welcome at all and to be honest - I would never stay there again nor would I reccommmend anyone to stay there. I was already going through a difficult time and the staff did not make it better...not to mention I got kicked out of my room 15 minutes after check out in a rude manner and as I was picking up my stuff to leave I was told in a sarcastic way ""You might as well stay because your card will be charged for a half a day"". I was very upset. I could hear everything ging on in the next room"
NEUTRAL,"A relatively new hotel, it provides clean, basic accomodations. The highlight was the free hot and cold breakfast buffet."
POSITIVE,"Free Breakfast Buffet was nice and filling. Free underground and above ground parking is good value because other hotels charge extra for those. A bit of a walk to the downtown core, Calgary tower and stampede area. The c-train isn't too far away. My Wife and I spent a weekend in Calgary in early March. The front staff at the hotel were really helpful when we asked about the tourist sites. On the first night there was a lot of noise coming from one of the rooms above. That went one for about an hour from 2am to 3am. We asked the next day and the front staff said there were a lot of complaints and the people had checked out. The 2nd night was nice and quiet. The hot breafast buffet was from 6am to 10am and we enjoyed it."
POSITIVE,"Great beds,clean room, good breakfast included, easy walk to the beach, restaurants, Trader Joe's, CVS,"
POSITIVE,"It was my wife's first time at the Hacienda, she wants to come back soon!!"
NEGATIVE,"Foul mouthed Pakistani or Indian. Smelly lobby and rude owner Patel or something like that. I have been to the area since and it is worth driving farther to Tell City or Rockport or Owensboro. He will not be getting my vote again. Room Tip: just stay away, this guy doesn't deserve business"
POSITIVE,This is our second time staying at this hotel. The rooms are nice and clean. The staff was friendly and the price was right!!! The ocean is right across street and the restaurants are walking distant.
NEUTRAL,"I arrived in Memphis without pre booking accomodation (my first big mistake) and it was late in the evening 9.30 pm and dark, not having been in memphis before ever, I decided the safest thing to do was to book into a motel/inn for the night. Came of the highway and spotted the roadside signs for accomodation beside the highway.Picked the Best western based on its exterior looks (2nd mistake). On arrival could not gain entry as main door was locked, pressed bell for attention and after two rings door was answered. Room rate was $72 a night, as I needed two nights, two were booked. on entering living accodation area it was like stepping back into the 70's, concourse was clean but dated .(major bad point)On entering room discovered, although I was at the back of the motel away from the noise of the busy highway, I had to contend with the constant running noise of heavy goods lorry refrigeration units as there is a large lorry park to the immediate rear of the motel, which remains busy all night,and the double glazing did nothing to suppress the noise. Plus points were room was clean but sparsely furnished, linen was clean and replaced daily if required, whole room had a 70's feel,had its own fridge/small freezer compartment, flat screen tv, coffee facilities present but without milk or tea,or spoon. Major plus point was there was a miriad of eateries nearby obviously for the servicing of the lorry park patrons, also an excellent petrol/service station next door with a good variety of services. Overall I thought the place was fair and clean but felt its location was bad particulary for someone like me who hadn't done their homework,and was aware of the lorry park to its rear. I myself would not use it again, but thought it was expensive for the quality recieved. Room Tip: There is no good rooms that I could see, as the front of the hotels is onto a busy highway and the rear rooms are backed onto by the ever awake lorry park."
POSITIVE,We were forced into an unexpected stay in Dallas and we needed a Hotel at the last minute in the metroplex. We used Hotels.com and found a great hotel for the price and location. Would defiantly do business with again. Great Hotel!
NEUTRAL,"rooms are small, bathtub is mini. looks a little dated, but generally clean. no views at all. nothing special, but not bad."
NEUTRAL,"The room literally smelled like urine in some areas... I sat down on the chair & when I left, I could smell urine on my person. Pretty nasty.. The beds weren't very comfortable, and it isn't satisfying that there isn't a hot tub."
NEGATIVE,"Sounded like a waterfall was going through our room 24/7, and room felt dirty"
NEUTRAL,"Close to some restaurants Smell in the room, breakfast Just Ok for the money I spent. The room did not smell really good even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I was staying on the first floor and it was really noisy with people walking above me. Also breakfast was very minimal with not many options. Refrigerator was making a lot of noise too and not to mention ant problem. Overall it was a Ok experience for me."
NEUTRAL,Almost everything was excellent The breakfast isn't good.
NEGATIVE,"We did a ""name your price reservation"" with hotwire, and were forced to pay more than the Best Western Laramie advertised on their own website. The management here is running a scam and refused to do anything to help. I'd stay far away from this hotel, and hotwire. I spent an hour on the phone with the ""manager"" of the Best Western, he said that it's not his fault that we tried to find a cheaper rate. Hotwire charged us $69+tax/night, and the hotel itself offered the rooms for $59+tax/night. What a ripoff, not to mention the hotel is terrible compared to others in the area at the same price. Brian B. Room Tip: Find another hotel."
NEUTRAL,Location The cold faucet of the shower was not working (was either full blast or nothing at all) the last day and I had to take a shower with cool water.
POSITIVE,very nice and clean place.during road constructions the staff helped us a lot to guide us to hotel.
NEUTRAL,This hotel needs a capital investment both outside and inside if it intends to compete with the level of newer hotels in the area.
POSITIVE,"We stayed 2 nights and had to go to office to get more towels for 2nd night, housekeeping did not replenish towels even though used towels were on floor."
NEGATIVE,"we had a bad experience at arrival : the toilet was not clean, and there was traces of the previous customers. We asked that to be cleaned in the morning but it had not been cleaned when we went back from our exploration in the coountry. So we went to Walmart and bought a box of disinfecting wipes. The bed is good but you can easily hear the other people in the rooms next to you. Not a good choice after all."
POSITIVE,"We've stayed at this hotel several times, but this is the first time that we've experienced a front deck person that seemed a little overwhelmed and lacking a welcoming smile."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is located in a low-rise business center, well back from the highway. In fact, it is a bit hard to find, especially at night. Because of its location, there was no traffic noise. The Provo River runs at the back of the hotel. The two story property looks as if it was built in the 1970's. Decor is from that era. My impression is that the hotel is well maintained, and reasonably up-to-date. (Some rooms were being re-painted at the time of my visit). But, beware. From my experience, there is a serious lack of management oversight of the front desk, and inadequate training of the front desk staff. While I spoke to the hotel 3 days prior to arrival to re-confirm reservations, and I called the front desk both in the morning and evening of our arrival day to advise we would be delayed arriving, when we arrived at the hotel at midnight, our rooms were not ready. The harried front desk clerk was unable to ""unblock"" rooms from the computer system so we could occupy them. When room keys were given out, some of the assigned rooms were already occupied, others had been freshly re-painted (and reeked of paint fumes). In my case, the first two rooms assigned were either occupied or not accessible. On the third attempt, I finally got into a room. I have no complaints about the room I ended up in (a 2 room suite, which was huge, a complimentary upgrade), so, as long as you can somehow avoid the hassle with the front desk, you stay will likely be satisfactory. Room Tip: 2 story hotel with no elevator. So request ground floor room if you have issues climbing stairs. R..."
POSITIVE,"As an international traveler I would highly recommend this venue to any seeking hospitality in the area. State of the Art would be John, working the front desk at night. Highly professional and amicable. what ever you need, it's done! Room very comfortable and with all amenities. Room clean, building clean."
POSITIVE,This is a very clean and well maintained hotel with one of the best beds I've had while traveling. The full breakfast is very good and the high point is the friendliness of everyone on the staff. I travel to the nearby airbase often and will definitely stay here again.
NEUTRAL,"The halls smelled strongly of insecticide. We assumed the transportation to the airport would be provided, as at other Best Westerns, but it was not, and then we were not quoted a price for the trip. It would have been cheaper to take a taxi. Hotel was clean but felt very tired and rundown."
POSITIVE,Excellent stay.. good breakfast. Everything was nice. Pros: comfort Cons: none Location: good
NEUTRAL,"Room was comfortable and breakfast was included. Parking was free and it was just a 20 minute drive from the airport. Although the bedroom was a good size, the bathroom was tiny and cramped. Still it was very clean."
POSITIVE,Noisy! People in next room - adjoining - up late and loud! (1 A.M.) Screaming kid in room as well. Don't travel on a weekend during the summer and stay at a hotel with a pool!
POSITIVE,"The room was awesome!!! It was large and had some wondeful touches!! Charming oversized chair with ottomon, full size closet with mirror doors across from a huge counter - so much space!!!!! A microwave and fridge in their own compartment; A little cafe on the premises which was perfect for breakfast!! Just a charming, clean, quiet, lovely place!!"
POSITIVE,"Great value, very clean and updated, very good place stay. I would recommend highly. Good Continental breakfast. They have done a great job of remodeling an old property."
NEUTRAL,"need screens in windows, with no ac you have to open windows in july. carpet needs replaced NOW"
POSITIVE,"Hotel is very comfortable and well kept. Room is spacious. Bed linens feel fresh and luxurious. A hearty breakfast (with sausages, eggs, muffins, toast, fruit, cereal, etc.) is included in the price."
POSITIVE,"Right off the I-94, near restaurants and movie theater, nice breakfast, good quality at a reasonable price."
POSITIVE,"We had a good stay. The room was very clean, good mattresses, and the breakfast was fine. The staff was excellent. Will repeat if we are in this area."
POSITIVE,nice clean what more do i need. close to down town and the mall.price right service with a smile
POSITIVE,"It is an older hotel without frills but it was very convenient, comfortable, clean and a good value for the price. The front desk staff was extremely nice too. I plan to stay there again."
POSITIVE,We have stayed here many times here. The rooms and service have always been great. The fact that they have rooms that accomodate pets is great. We will continue to book rooms here in the future.
NEGATIVE,"Horrible! I will no stay here again. Very dated and run down. Towels felt like sandpaper, and smelled!"
POSITIVE,"We picked this hotel to: a) get away from the horrible other hotel we booked, and b) be close to the airport for our early-morning flight home. This hotel was perfect on both counts. The staff is friendly, the place seems as clean as if it went up yesterday, the beds are super comfortable and they have a free breakfast in the morning! I am definitely [?] staying here again the next time I'm in Austin!"
POSITIVE,This is one of my favorite hotels. The views are stunning and the location is perfect for a visit of the Multnomah falls area. I highly recomend this hotel.
POSITIVE,It was clean! The room are small
POSITIVE,"I worried about possible noise because of this site's proximity to the Interstate, but it was very quiet. Well maintained - very clean - even the stairwells. The king bed was quite comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommodating - excellent service. I would recommend this Best Western to anyone visiting the area. Room Tip: Lower numbered rooms are closer to the elevator which in NOT centrally located. We had room 207 which was excellent!"
POSITIVE,"Great value, clean well appt. rooms, and most of all fabulous staff make this a slam dunk for business or pleasure. I travel alot and this place stands head and shoulders above the rest. Room Tip: Go for the 3rd floor. Great lake views!"
POSITIVE,Fine for a short stay--clean room. Decor is a bit worn but staff was friendly and location was good.
NEUTRAL,very dog friendly! but expensive $20 extra per night
NEUTRAL,Good position. It is easy to reach. Close to anything you need. Our room was clean. Absolutely poor breakfast..
POSITIVE,"The room was really cute. I stayed in a single queen room which usually I'm afraid is going to be like a closet...this wasn't. It was actually quite cute, clean, and quiet. However the shower was in need of some help. The shower head was loose where it goes into the wall and there was some hair left behind from someone else. Nothing I couldn't deal with though."
NEUTRAL,Location Expensive parking
POSITIVE,Great for the price! Friendly front counter help would definitely stay there again! Pros: Clean rooms convenient to get to.
POSITIVE,"I received a call from the hotel about mid day of arrival day confirming my reservation and late check-in. A nice touch, never had that done before. The staff was very friendly , rooms clean and the parking area was well lit and clean. My wife was very pleased with the facility. We will stay there again."
POSITIVE,"You couldn't ask for a better place to stay in Grand Marais. The rooms are super clean and very spacious. The staff is friendly and helpful! The price is worth the room quality and cleanliness! Room Tip: We booked last minute and got a great internet price. Prior to that the rooms were a little spendy. If you are willing to wait to last minute, might be worth the savings!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel actually was voted a top place to stay by Tripadvisor for 2011. We did'nt know this before booking but we say why it got high marks after staying there. First this is a PLUS hotel so it had a few extra good things like a free extended breakfast. This included waffles, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and lots of other choices. The beds were excellent and the staff was friendly and helpful. The free shuttle did'nt hurt either. We had a small dog that was welcomed without issue and they had a special area reserved for dogs/cats to do their business. You must take the Boeing tour if you get chance. A free shuttle is available although we drove there. The tour lasts about 1-1/2 hours and shows the assembly areas of the 2 flavors of planes. Very informative and the $18 per person is not that bad. We purchased a tow dolley from Poulsbo RV and I readily recommend them for any RV related purchases. Very helpful staff and reasonable prices. Room Tip: Lower floor can be a little noisy until about 9:00 PM"
NEGATIVE,We were hearing all kinds of noises at 3-4AM in the morning.the hotel was under construction and it smells the cigarrette smoke pretty badly.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was fairly convenient to the highway and in a quiet area very near BGSU. The hotel was clean and quiet, which was good as I arrived at 11:00 pm and wanted a good night's sleep prior to leaving at 7:30 am for appointments the next morning. I booked through Priceline, and named my own price and saved $10 over the rack rate. Very reasonable, considering the hotels just down the road in Findlay were at least $20 more. For my purposes, since all I wanted was a bed--the $20 I saved payed for dinner and breakfast in the morning. Room Tip: I always like the first floor."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here two nights before heading back on our flight north to snow and cold. This place was the tonic for finishing a great time in the south. We booked the oceanfront efficiency and landed on the 5th floor - great view of the ocean and the beach and at sunrise off the balcony with slider - WOW - this was premium! The neat part of the oceanfront was that the front door was on the west side giving you a perfect view of the sunset! We watched the sun go down over Ormond Beach and enjoyed going back in the room and having the slider open with the evening breeze greeting the dark. Just so nice. The room did have a slight odor that comes from not being opened regularly and the hotel lost their hot water the night before we went to leave and then water altogether in the morning. Nice clerk did give a discount to make us feel better for not having a hot shower before flying home, which was appreciated. The hotel restaurant was closed but we did enjoy the room - AND the view, unforgettable! We'll go back when in town. Room Tip: Book a oceanfront efficiency and see the sunrise and sunset from up-top!"
POSITIVE,"Great Price with Free Hot Complimentary Breakfast! Friendly staff! Quick Check-in! Comfortable Room with Flat Screen, Microwave & Frig! Comfortable Bed!"
POSITIVE,Excellent trip to cottowood and stay at the perfect place. I wouls highly recommend this hotel. super clean and beds really comfy.
POSITIVE,"Location, Eco-friendly Sound proofing not so good."
POSITIVE,"The rooms were large and clean with comfortable beds and plenty of pillows. The hotel was right off the interstate highway, but was surprisingly quiet. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay there again."
NEUTRAL,"I stayed here last weekend with my son (12 yo) for skiing at Mt. Sunapee. It's super convenient, practically at the entrance to the access road. It's safe and clean. Newer beds + comforters, quite comfy. Definitely no frills; it's not romantic or cozy, just a room to crash in. But for the price we paid ($99) it is totally adequate and just what we were looking for. Free wifi (fast too), TV, fine bathroom, good shower. Could it have been nicer? Sure. If you could find a more homey place in the same area for the same price, I'd say take it. The included breakfast is poor (cereal, coffee, juice, very limited hot options); I suggest walking over to Digby's (across the parking lot) for a big breakfast if that's what you want."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I enjoy visiting Chincoteague Island all times of the year. Several years ago, we discoved this Best Western and have made it our regular place to stay. Everyone who works there, from the cleaning crew to the front desk help, are always professional, friendly, and helpful. They are never too busy to engage in conversation, and we learn something new about the area with each visit. The rooms and property are spotless, and the landscaping beautiful year round. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit during any season."
POSITIVE,"Spacious clean rooms with a area separate for a sink and refrigeration. Pet Friendly. The indoor pool as nice and warm and the hot tub was hot. (Sometimes they are just warm). Staff was friendly and the free breakfast was made to order. There is a Chinese food restaurant attached to this hotel, although it was closed for the holidays while we were there."
NEGATIVE,"From our room at the Best western Plus Placerville Inn ,the road noise very loud, the ""White Noise""didn't help. When we made the reservation I was told that rooms faced Greenleaf drive ,the noise from highway 50 would not be a problem. At check out, Iwas tokld that how it is . Room Tip: try rooms poolside"
POSITIVE,Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the lite breakfast bar. Perfect for a quick one night stay in the area.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for our son's move-in day for college. Hotel location is very good, the staff very pleasant, and the pool area looked nice (didn't have time to use it). I'd definitely recommend it."
POSITIVE,"No complaints at all, very clean and comfortable room, nice complimentary breakfast and front desk extremely friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel to anyone :) Pros: Front Desk Staff Cons: None Location: Easy to find on Cortez just off the junction with US19"
POSITIVE,"Great staff, are on top of things when you have questions"
POSITIVE,"My husband and I go back many years with Best Westerns and the conditions and professionalism of staff is all over the place. This Best Western, however, is the best we've stayed at and, after avoiding BWs for many years, gives us confidence in the franchise chain once again.Everything about the place is positive, from the friendly greeting when we checked in to the comfort and cleanliness of the room, with all the amenities we could want. Even the property was nice, with gorgeous window boxes full of blooming flowers all over. Ample covered parking close to all the rooms. Easy walking distance to a number of restaurants and cafes and close to the convention center.It was just a very pleasant experience!"
POSITIVE,"Brand new hotel, good free breakfast, the bed was not as soft as I'd like but overall I'd have no isses with going back."
NEGATIVE,Just not a safe hotel for families with small kids
POSITIVE,"It's very close to universal studios, Walking Distance. It's very clean. You feel like you are at home."
POSITIVE,the breakfast was a little weak compared to the competitors. but the coffee was decent.
NEUTRAL,The condition and furnitures of the hotel are not update.
POSITIVE,"We stayed one night in this motel. Great service, clean room, good location"
NEGATIVE,"i reserved this hotel just because free parking(shown Priceline.com) so i made a reservation ,suit room, 3days but when i check in, they said they can't serve free parking but discount! and they are all rude and unkind to me and didn't tell me parking location and internet is too slow ,so finally gave up access to internet location...this is the only good merit for this hotel..."
POSITIVE,Less than 5min shuttle to airport. Friendly staff.
POSITIVE,"Even though it was a non-smoking room, it smelled very much like cigarettes. The staff came and sprayed it with Febreze and it helped a lot. Other than that, everything else was fine."
POSITIVE,We stayed two nights in one of the casitas and enjoyed our stay. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and we used the refridgerator to keep our left overs from eating at the good restaurants in the area. The radio had a cord for a MP3 player. The breakfast was good and we would stay there again. The drive to Sedona is easy.
POSITIVE,I would definatly recommand this hotel to all my family and friends i give it a thumbs up :-) very clean and great customer service at the front desk...very welcoming
POSITIVE,This hotel was a nice surprise at the end of a trip. Great big rooms with a fridge and microwave. Only thing lacking was a pool.
NEGATIVE,"Overall it was okay but the windows in each room we had were broken and cold air came through. I told them about the first broken window in room 1. They graciously moved us to another room and the same bottom windows were broken, so I gave up and just covered the broken windows with drapes. The staff was good however and the room was fine otherwise. They had delicious homemade chocolate cookies also."
POSITIVE,Hotel staff competent and welcoming; room maids efficient and flexible; restaurant/bar staff friendly; breakfast plentifull.
POSITIVE,Good breakfast. Plenty of parking and staff allowed us to check in very early. Good location. No complaints at all.
POSITIVE,The room was nice and the staff was helpful and friendly. They had a wide variety of breakfast options and they cook an omelet fresh and it is excellent. I recommend this inn. It is very reasonable and nice.
POSITIVE,"Oklahoma City was a halfway point for us as we traveled from Texas to Nebraska. The motel was easy to find and conveniently located near eating establishments and the one attraction we wanted to see. Our room was clean and comfortable, and thebreakfast was well supplied. Staff was friendly and helpful."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here for two nights on a family vacation. It is very close to the airport. The driver and front staff were quite helpful in answering our questions as it was our first time to Juneau. We stayed in the room that had kitchenette. This included stove, small fridge and a sink. However, there were no cooking untencils of any kinds, making cooking impossible unless you travel with your pots and pans. They do have microwave which was helpful. I think this was why the fridge was moldy and smelly, as no one propbaly had used it. We had some frozen food with us so I had to clean out the fridge before using it. It rains a lot in Juneau, so it was very humid in the room, with some modly smell. They have heater but not fan or A/C so when it was 50 degrees outside, we had no way of ventilating the room. It felt very stuffy so we opened the window for sleeping and let the air in. I was a little uncomfortable doing that because we stayed on the first floor next to the parking lot, but I could not sleep with feeling so closed in. Otherwise, inside the room was adequate. Beds were fine. Bathroom fan had fnny noise and I wasn't sure if it worked or not. Housekeeping was good. Good thing is they also had breakfast so it was convenient for early outings. I did inform the front desk when we left of the moldy fridge and she said she would inform the manager. Overall, it was OK. Probaly will find some other place to stay if we return again."
POSITIVE,"The entire staff starting in the parking area, front desk etc. went out of their way to make everything pleasant. It was a great experience. Room Tip: Pool and exercise area were closed. If this is importnat to you, check when booking."
POSITIVE,Best Western on Chaffin Place in Murfreesboro is conveniently located near Interstate 24. The hotel is pet friendly which is important to us. The counter clerk was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean. The bathroom needs refurbishing but was clean. Breakfast was typical continental but the items were stale.Maybe they could work on that. I recommend eating breakfast out. I would definitely stay there again.
POSITIVE,"Needed a place close to the Medical Center, and this was the best combination of value, location, and style anywhere near. It is within walking distance, but they have a shuttle if you need it. All the rooms and decor have been updated. Clean, quiet and comfortable.Good complimentary breakfast. Will stay there again if the need arises."
POSITIVE,"We were booked in the wrong Best Western in Lake County initially and when we arrived at Best Western in Leesburg, FL however, the staff and the hotel were excellent par none. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the hotel was clean, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the breakfast was very nourishing and fulfilling. We enjoyed it so much that we bookedÂ the same hotel for our business trip the very next weekend. I would recommend this hotel anyday. Thumbs up!"
NEGATIVE,"Our stay was december 2011. We were promised wireless internet which didn't work. Plus, at $130 the night WITHOUT breakfast in such place we felt that it was way too pricey. There are far better and newer hotels in Boone."
NEUTRAL,"My room is at the back of the building, there is some kind of electric facility behind the building, therefore I couldn't open the window at night when I sleep due to the noise, otherwise, everything is fine."
POSITIVE,"Everyone was very helpful,kind and tried to help in any way."
POSITIVE,"I visit Buffalo annually and it was my first time staying at this hotel. It is definitely worth the price. It is 10-15 minutes to downtown and 20 minutes or so to Ralph Wilson Stadium. The rooms are very clean and we found nothing wrong with it. The breakfast was very good, and free. Great visit!!"
POSITIVE,We lost our power and had to find a hotel in PA to stay warm-this was a very goodchoice-great value for the $$
POSITIVE,"the room and all of its amenities were more than i had anticipated. Larger room, great decore, comfortable king size bed with micro wave and fridge. wonderful view of one of Vancouvers major streets and a great balcony. Parking very convenient and completely safe in a not completely safe part of the city."
POSITIVE,We stayed the night before flying out of the Buffalo Airport. It is a 10 minute drive to the airport from the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable but a bit dated although it looked like other rooms were getting a facelift. Great continental breakfast and a friendly staff.
POSITIVE,"Great value and only 10 minutes from Baton Rouge. We stay here every year for an LSU game and the hotel is always clean. Everything you need is close by (Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Rite-Aid) and it is located right off of the Interstate. The onlynegative is the water pressure."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel is a complete dump. It's filthy. It's completely run down. It literally sits on top of a highway (I am not kidding.) There is nothing around it. It's in a completely industrial area. The Ohana is its ""sister hotel"". It was the only place to eat so I had to go there. It is also terrible. I stayed at the hotel because i got in late and had an early morning flight the next day. I wanted to be close to the airport. It was a terrible mistake. The pictures on your website are terribly misleading. No one should stay at this hotel."
NEGATIVE,"Disliked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,"Husband made reservations on line. Funny story: when we checked in, went to our room. I went to open the door. and noticed there was stuff on the floor like the hall was not vaccummed well. opened the door and there was NO furniture! the fridge and Microwave were in the bathroom. they had just installed new carpet. we went to the desk laughing. can we get a discount there is no furniture in our room. the front desk people were shocked. but laughed with us. we did get another room. they were very nice about it. I would stay again I love that hotel Room Tip: if you are a tired traveler ask to get a room on the back side by the hill. the front is a little no..."
NEGATIVE,"2 nights spent in 2 different rooms because the first room was so small, I've worn bigger overcoats. When I asked to be moved the receptionist was shirty at me asking. The rooms look clean from a distance but lack a detailed clean fir the money. The bedding felt and smelled worn out. The staff although on the whole reasonably efficient were less than welcoming and gave about as much warmth as a tramps flip flop. The breakfast was prompt and very good with a choice of cooked breakfasts. (and they can poach an egg) but we chose to dine out dye to an empty dining conservatory dull menu and expensive prices. My advice. Book elsewhere if you want to sleep soundly the road is noisy and in august you suffocate without the windows wide open due to lack of aircon. The bathroom was clean but again unless you are prepared to poo in the bath there is precious little room. All in all soulless, noisy, small and way to steep for the money."
POSITIVE,"Very big, clean room with confortable beds. Breakfast with some hot items. The pool area is a big no no! so if your really in need of the pool this is not the pool you want! I reserve here because of the pool as i have two young kids but they don't have any ventilation or air conditioning there so the pool are was about 97 degrees when we went in. It seems like they most have some exhaust pipes because I can't understand how is it so hot! I couldn't breath in there! The pool could use a bit of help, some paint and the water wasn't clear at all. Like I say good hotel very clean big rooms but just don't take in consideration the pool area. Besides from that no complains we really had no issues in the rooms itself."
POSITIVE,After visiting the Mayo Clinic we found out we had to stay longer. Went back to the hotel and spoke to the young lady at the desk who told us that our room had been extended until Sat. We asked for a room with microwave and frig for the same price and the same room price. Checking with the desk because the hot water pipe busted and if we would get creditÂ and he did. Then came the surprise that she did not extend the room. The person said he would make contact with her and of course she denied everything. That truly hurt because we believed her. She truly deceived us and then lied and said she told us there were not room. Which she did not. Truly disappointed.
NEUTRAL,"Not compared to the photos, was hoping for more."
NEUTRAL,"We spent there 3 nights in January. The hotel is not centrally located but within 10 minutes by car you can reach Miami Beach and the city center. The room was good size but the carpet looked very old and really had a bad smell so we kept the window open to have fresh air. Prices are very good compared with other places and there's a nice little pool with a nice view. Wi-fi was not working very well, but there's a computer that you can use at the reception area. Across the street we had our best pizza in the USA."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was a nice place to stay, we had gone to Door County the last weekend in September 2011 and had found out they had a massive storm up on the peninsula, 12,000 without power. All the hotels were filing up fast, but we had reservations. I explained to them my wife had foot surgery and wasn't able to do stairs. They gave us the very first room off the lobby, 2 Queen beds, frig, microwave, table and 2 chairs. We didn't spend much time in the room as we were out sightseeing most of the weekend. The hotel has a large breakfast (continental) area, off the lobby, a indoor pool and hot tub. They also have a tv and sitting area in the lobby for guests to watch, brochures off all the things to do and see up and down the peninsula. We would definately stay there again. The cost was only 94.00 a night with the AARP discount. Room Tip: Get a ground floor room as they only have stairs, no elevator"
NEGATIVE,"This hotel was awful, I prepaid for two waterfront rooms and my room overlooked the parking lot. They said they didn't have a waterfront room. My door did not lock, the knob could be opened from the outside, I have never stayed at a hotel where the knob did not lock when you left the room. They did fix this the next day. The light over the sink didn'tÂ work so I was unable to see to put on make up and had to use a hall mirror, and the bed lamp didn't work. The A/C was louder than a vacuum cleaner so I had to keep it off. It was better to be hot and be able to get to sleep. Management was completely unresponsive, I will never stay at a Best Western again."
POSITIVE,"we traveled to naples for a wedding over a long weekend & brought our 2 young children. we were looking for an inexpensive hotel option & couldn't have been happier for the price! the room was simple but clean, included breakfast was fantastic,pool was awesome & had an adjacent jacuzzi / hot tub. we'll definitely stay here next time we're in the area!"
NEUTRAL,"My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Valencia Inn on our way to Phoenix. We checked in late, and they were very heavily booked which means we got one of the last rooms. And unfortunately, it was not a very nice room either. The motel is built right next to Interstate 5. As a result, I could have thrown a football from the door of my room and hit one of the several hundred 18-wheelers that passed by all night long. That wouldn't be that big of an issue if the door sealed well, but it does not, so we had to crank up the AC to drown out the road noise. We actually had stayed at this property before, but our that was a few years ago and that room was away from the freeway so we didn't have any issues. Word to the wise: make sure you get a room that is as far from the freeway as possible. And overall, this is not the best Best Western around by a long shot. The staff was great, but the room itself was a bit dingy, the king size bed was fairly lumpy and worn out, and for the money, I think they could do better. Also, we left around 9AM, and there was only coffee left - no pastries, no nothing. On the plus side, I needed to print out a document, and their lobby computer lets you do that and there is no charge. The big factor in any stay is whether or not you'd stay there again. In this case, we might consider staying there again, but I don't think it would be our first choice, and we would insist on a room that wasn't being assaulted by room noise 24/7. I think they need to spend some money on new beds and improved door seals before they could guarantee a return visit from us! Room Tip: Be sure to get a room as far away from the interstate as possible."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here in June of '97, and it was a nice place then. (Built in '95)"
POSITIVE,This was a great hotel with close proximity to Disneyland. I wish they had a continental breakfast...that would have made it perfect!
POSITIVE,"once we arrived at the airport, we had to chase down the shuttle bus because the best western logo on it was so small you could not see it till it was passing you, plus the driver would not come to complete stops. it was annoying to have to waittil 2pm for check in at the hotel but was happy to have stores and fast food in walking distance. the amenities are great and the staff, very helpful and inviting. the best part of the stay is the room we got. it was very spacouse, clean and comfortable. had a great night of sleep. i highly recomend this hotel"
POSITIVE,"We visit Disneyland on monthly basis and very often stay at this Best Western. The best place for Disneyland- great people, clan rooms that are always ready on time and no problem with parking- even before checking in and after checking out. I recomend to all our friends and everyone loves it."
POSITIVE,"Hotels.com was able to book 2 rooms at this site when the Best Western site said none were available. It was shooting in the dark picking a hotel along the strip at San Simeon and this one was lovely, nice views from the view rooms, working fireplaces, decent restaurant, friendly people."
POSITIVE,"Freeway close with a great selection of Breakfast Treats! Clean rooms, well maintained property with refrigerators and microwaves in every room. Staff is very friendly and accomodating. There are movies to rent for free at night and a large heated pool as well as a jacuzzi. The rates are reasonable and the property is quiet at night."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel very clean, nice service."
POSITIVE,"the beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable! The fridge and micro in room were appreciated. Curbside appeal is lacking, inside was very nice."
POSITIVE,"Went for a weekend, hotel was cheap and not that far from downtown Providence. Great ""Free"" Breakfast and the beds were comfortable."
POSITIVE,This was a really great place to stay. The beds were very comfortable and everything in the room worked properly. The highways surrounding the hotel were pretty noisly but turning the A/C fan on drowned out everything. I slept great here! The hotel is right off I-24 so downtown Nashville is just a short drive.
POSITIVE,"This property keeps getting better and better everytime we go back! Great Value, great staff, great free breakfast, great customer service attitude, great beds. If you need to stay in Indio or close to it, this IS the place to stay. Room Tip: Join their rewards program (BW) & get upgrades"
NEUTRAL,"You get what you pay for. Very simple, clean-cut accommodations. Sterile atmosphere made it seem ho-hum, run of the mill motel. While there wasn't anything wrong with the room, it just felt old and used. The breakfast bar has few choices, and they were out of certain items each morning."
NEGATIVE,The hotel itself is nice but the rooms are not even on par with a dorm room. This is a place you book if there is no other place available during a football game but not if you have other choices available.
POSITIVE,"Best Western in Brantford was great! We were offered a free upgrade and the room was large, clean and well-appointed! The pool area is a VERY long walk from the new wing, though, and a bit older but still nice. Service was good and stay was excellent!"
NEUTRAL,"Location - access to IHOP - parking access fitness room locked-had to get key from front desk. Noisy environment late night + early morning (mostly employees). No breakfast included with room fee (Best Western Plus, Fullerton, had lovely breakfast available PLUS free parking)."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed 5 nights here and all in all it was a positive experience. My main complaints is that it is kind of noisy at times and not every room has a microwave/fridge, and the electrics (plugs) seemed a little off... Overall though comfy bed, clean room, good service, not bad for the price."
POSITIVE,"Staff was very nice, prices were reasonable. Fitness center was old and needs to be updated"
NEUTRAL,"Staff where very helpful and free shuttle bus to beach. Rooms need renovating, very old carpets and almost a stale smell in our room. Quite a long walk from beach and night life if thats what you're going to Santa Monica for but bus service is outside and very good."
POSITIVE,Made last minute reservations over July 4th weekend. Very satisfied.
NEGATIVE,"Cons: I was told my requests, sold out. Appeared many empty rooms & little traffic."
NEUTRAL,I was asked to sign a paper in case there was smoking in the non smoking room which was fine but the room itself had a moldy like smell which gave me a headache so we left pretty early in the morning. Stayed here before in a smoking room and would have rather had to deal with that. It only had one chair with a round table so there was no eating or drinkingÂ at the table together which was poor and the bathroom door did not close all the way. Stayed because of the casino across the street and didn't want to worry about drinking and driving but ended up not being worth the money to end up smelling that all night. I wished I would have stayed home.
POSITIVE,"This hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations. It was very clean, and had great furnishings in the room. I stayed 4 nights, and had issues with wireless internet connectivity. I called the front-desk, and the gentlemen at the desk resolved the issue within minutes. Everything else was great, and I was very pleased."
POSITIVE,"Before arriving in Waikiki we had read many reviews about the Coconut hotel and most of them were rave reviews. I am happy to report that we also truly enjoyed our experience at this Best Western. What it lacks in location (not right on the beach) it more than makes up with in service, cleanliness and character. The staff was able to check us in early to our room, the concierge gave us great advice on getting to beaches and sights that would be less touristy and the waffle maker at breakfast was my husbands favorite thing! It was an excellent experience!"
NEGATIVE,"My wife and I checked into this hotel @ 11:30pm after driving from Buffalo in an extremely intense rain storm. We were just looking for a shower and some much needed sleep. We found our room with no trouble although there were quite a few wedding party revelers still roaming the halls in search of beer. We found that the bathroom had not been cleaned. Soap, shampoo and face cloth were still as they had been left by the last guest. I pulled the covers down on the bed to find that it had been made but not changed. A quick call to the front desk, an apology, an upgrade just down the hall; we moved. The next morning, as I was carrying our luggage to the car, I overheard a conversation between two of the housekeepers. One was thanking the other for cleaning half of the rooms they were supposed to have cleaned so that they could leave work early. I wonder if that might have been my room. While I was paying the bill I mentioned the events of the previous evening and was told that the hotel has a zero tolerance policy for disorderly patrons. Well that's fine if its enforced. I payed full price for my memorable stay and by the way; I too have a zero tolerance policy. I will never stay at this particular hotel again!! I hope this review will be helpful to others. Advise that you ask to see the room prior to checking in!"
POSITIVE,room was very basic but was close to all hotel amenities. Front desk staff friendly and helpful Pros: Close to restaurants and shopping. Cons: Room was very small and basic. Pull out sofa bed was broken and very uncomfortable. Hairdryer did not work.
POSITIVE,"I've stayed here twice now and both experiences were pleasant. The staff is friendly, accommodations are clean and the included FULL breakfast is a great deal! I would recommend this hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"After Making reservations and calling 3x about room.Making sure it was Non smoking and asking about check-in. I was assured room would be in order. However when we got there we were asked if we had reservation. We told them yes so they asked us to stand in a line. Where we then waited for our turn to be told there were no rooms left and we had to go to another hotel. They didn't care and were quite happy to cancel and refund my money just get out. So my family ended up driving home in the Pouring rain. ""Best Western"" DON'T THINK SO! NEVER AGAIN! Room Tip: Go somewhere else someplace that honor RESERVATIONS"
POSITIVE,"Excellent value, clean, all services you could want. And the soda machine wasn't priced outrageously, that was just a nice surprise. Pros: Clean, hot tub, staff accommodated request for quiet room, and very close to SFO at a fair price. Cons: Hot tub bubbles turn off at 9:45 pm, period, although tub is open to 11 pm. Strange."
POSITIVE,"Enjoyed our stay. Bed was comfortable, room was spacious enough and clean. Staff very helpful when asked. Did not try the on-site restaurant, but the free parking really turned this into a great deal. Pros: Close restaurants Quiet free parking"
POSITIVE,"I want to write a good review because this hotel really made an effort to be a great place to stay...very hospitable, warm cookies in the evening, good breakfast, nice pool, very nicely decorated rooms, good rates, etc....but we got bedbug bites the first night we were there. The hotel was honest and said they had had problems with that but mostly onÂ the upper floor (we were on the bottom floor). At least they were honest! So, if you can handle the bedbug bites, then this is a good place to stay."
POSITIVE,"The suite was beautiful, comfortable, updated, and classy...couldn't asked for much more!! Complimentary breakfast was served in a more professional buffet setting then most hotels have. Wonderful pool that looked more like a natural rock pond area with stone structure with water fall area yoiu could sit under. Will come back again!!"
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this property twice now and wouldn't consider any place else in town. The value for the price ($63 + tax AAA rate) is outstanding. The hotel is clean and the staff was great. Breakfast was excellent. If I had to change one thing, it would be to add automatic doors onto the lobby. It's a pain to drag luggage thru a double set of doors that don't open on their own. Room Tip: my room was on the first floor, north side"
POSITIVE,Wow what a great hotel so close to Boeing. I was in town for a job interview and landed at this place. I was so surprised with the airplane wing standing off the side of the hotel. really cool btw. The staff was friendly and helped me to figure out how to get around Everett. The room had a kitchen with a stove and full size frig. If I was going to stay for a bit longer I would have used the kitchen more. I was ok with my microwaved pizza though. I did find that they have food in the lobby at night but I got there at 8pm and missed out on the free food. not sure what it was but hate to pass up a free meal. I did have a great breakfast in the morning. Really I cooked a waffle and it was great. cool spread for a free breakfast. I had eggs and biscuits with gravy too. All I can say is that this place was great and I will stay here again... when I land that job :)
POSITIVE,"An absolutely pleasure to walk into this place. Pristine, very well decorated bed was comfortable and we slept well ! Receptionist and server in the cafe were very pleasantv and accommodating and they allowed our very apprehensive pets We will be back!!!"
POSITIVE,"Best value in Elko! Staff was amazing, rooms were luxurious. Continental breakfast was the best I ever had! Great pool and fitness center and free wifi. Best place to stay in Elko! Hot tub was too hot"
POSITIVE,"Great location, just a few minutes walk from the beach. Breakfast was great, excellent service! Swimming pool and bar, also nice for the evening as kids can swim and parents can sit on the patio (bar). Room on poolside, especially on the sundeck was very nice. Limited vending machines: only one with water/soda near the pool Rooms are small and basic"
NEGATIVE,"Luke warm body theory at front desk, ask for simple directions, or even 'where do you like to eat"" you get the ahhhhhhh, I ahhh, well there's ahh. Upon arriving at room, chipped or cracked walls, paint, etc. Towels at the edges were falling apart. Below average decor, who decorates with plastic flowers with real water in the bowls????? Breakfest was less than average. Area and location had abundant opportunities for food. Just don't be suprised, lower your expectations, and you will be fine. Sign at front desk indicates you will be charged for ANY additional items which includes shampoo, towels. They do give you the price of everything up front so if any thing is missing, they will assume (yes it's on the sign) you took it and therefore ok to charge to your cc. Room Tip: there are none at all"
POSITIVE,Nice and friendly staff. The rooms are kept very clean. Not so much the hotel but unfortunately the neighborhood is a little bit dangerous at night so don't leave anything inside the car.
NEGATIVE,The price was way too high given that the bed was super uncomfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was ridiculously small and parking was an additional fee. Not worth it.
POSITIVE,"The room was very clean and spacious for the price. When I booked, I was told that there was a complimentary shuttle to Disney World and that Universal was across the street. It was the main reason for my booking."
NEUTRAL,"This was my third winter breack in a row I chose this hotel as my ""ski base"", this time with some good friends from Germany. The first unpleasant surprise was the delaying of the shuttle schedule by 5 days, from 12/18 to 12/23. This was a major inconvenience forcing us to rent an (expensive) 4 wheel drive car due to the abundant snow on the road. The second annoyance was the rattling noise of the heating unit that wasn't fixed during the week we spent there. The desk staff doesn't seem go out of their way to accomodate your needs, and by the way they could some how acknowlege my presence for the 3rd time in the row at their hotel. The nicest are the shuttle drivers, and the breackfast buffet is excellent. Pros: Free breakfast relatively close to ski slopes Cons: Noisy desk staff"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean and friendly. Fridge and microwave in room. Breakfast was good but was the same every day, and on the weekend, it was packed. Pros: Great price while still being close to Napa and Sonoma. Cons: No real restaurants within walking distance."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel twice before and now all three times have been a dream come true. It truly is a 5 star all around experience. If you want an afforable stay, near the airport, then look no further. The hotel and all it's componets are beautiful, clean, elegant. The breakfast, happy hour and dinner are delicious and plentiful. 2 free drinks during the happy hour! How fun! The staff is friendly and well versed. Super clean, modern, huge flat screen TV's in each room. Cute little suites, with couches and desks. Really, you can't ask for more for an average of $75 a night. Come stay here, it's awesome!"
POSITIVE,"As loyal Best Western Platinum members, we booked this hotel for a Route 80 stopoff enroute to NY. We were excited it was a new property. We booked 6 months in advance. We called from the road to even let the front desk know our time of arrival. After 8 hours on the road, we checked in and we were sent to a room that was never cleaned. The nice lady at the front desk claimed that the computer indicated otherwise. She then sent us to another uncleaned room. At this point we asked her to contact the front desk manager who did nothing other than offer us 1000 points - what a slap iin the face (she should be fired and is no ambassador to Best Western). We were in the lobby waiting for 1 hour until there was a clean room. Although the room was cleaned in a hurry, the housekeeper never checked the alarm clock and we were awakened at 5:30AM! It was a really lousy experience. You would think that we would never stay here again but thanks to a terrific gentleman, Ander Victorine, the general manager, we are so reassured! He met with us the following morning. He realized that there was a problem with some of the staff and assured us that he would take the necessary measures of correction. Because of him, we will return. He offered us good will and is a problem solver. The property is nice, the breakfast was good, computers are available and we liked the location. If Ander is there, we will return."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of September(should have been 3, but thanks to Aer Lingus spent 1 night at Heathrow). We were on the ground floor, the room had high ceilings and was quite old fashioned but clean. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful but a bit of a squeeze and as we were right next to the breakfast room, there was no chance of a lie in as the chair scraping started at 7am. The staff were friendly and helpful and there is a supermarket right across the road. I would recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Vancouver on a budget, it is about a 30 min walk to Gastown, but just be careful as we met a lot of unsavoury characters just when you leave Chinatown and that was only about 9pm."
POSITIVE,"During a recent 5 day trip to Tampa, Florida my husband and I were able to watch the beautiful sunsets from our hotel balcony, or from the comfortable chairs placed near the walkway at this hotel. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and all requests were handled efficiently and quickly. The gym was clean and well maintained, with a water view and two televisions. The pool area was clean, with an attached dock that was big enough for a band on Sunday afternoon. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel and one within walking distance that offer outside seating and good food. The only downside was the business center, which is in a noisy area of the lobby. The two computers were in use much of the time, so bring your laptop and take advantage of the free in room WiFi. Room Tip: Waterview rooms are nice, but with all of the available common area seats the street view rooms are..."
NEUTRAL,Next to airport runway (loud). Room smelled like raw sewage. May have been isolated.
POSITIVE,"this is a nice business travel hotel within reasonable distance from the airport and access to DT Seattle. The staff are warm and welcoming. the rooms and bedding are comfortable. Pros: sfficient airport shuttle, lots of on site parking, complementary internet. Cons: Long corridors, OK bath sundries."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was Very Clean, Comfortable and the Staff was Very Friendly! :-)"
POSITIVE,"I have been a conference speaker for the past 30 years. The last place I want to be is another hotel living out of a suitcase. I entered the Best Western in Gas City Indiana on my way from Florida to the UP of Michigan. For the next two days I felt like we were celebs of some kind. The treatment we recieved was way above average. Everyone made us feel at home with warm friendly greatings to going out of their way to make sure our every need was met. It was by far my greatest hotel experience. Who would ever think, in Gas City Indiana."
POSITIVE,"Had a family emergency and needed to find a hotel at the last minute. The receptionist was very kind and noticed that I was part of another group and was able to put our rooms beside each other. The receptionist also told us that if we needed anything at all that there were plenty of workers who lived on-sight that would be able to assist us. I feltÂ very safe and comfortable at this hotel. For me, the only downside was navigating to the hotel, but other than that I would stay there again if I needed to."
POSITIVE,"The receptionist on the morning of check out was extremely uncooperative. I was simply retrieving some items my son left in his room 212, May 30, 2011. I spoke with Ms. Davis, head of house cleaning. She informed me that the items will be left in her office with my son's name on it however; when I spoke with the receptionist, she was to quick to sayÂ there was nothing found in that room. After waiting in between our conversation and incoming telephone calls, I convinced her, I know the items were there and that I just needed her to get Ms. Davis. Ms Davis was contacted and we were able to retrieve the package."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was extremely clean and comfortable. I particularly enjoyed the clever layout of the hotel, specifically the view from the room, which overlooked the pool. As another review mentioned, the windows do in fact face the inside of the hotel, but in my honest opinion, do not minimize privacy (closing the curtains was all it took)."
POSITIVE,Easy to get reservation. Did online and checked in an hour later. We had a terrible experience with another Redwood City hotel. We were delighted to get into this hotel promptly.
POSITIVE,"As long as your dog does not do damage to the room there is no pet fee, this hotel has some great open space to let your dog pee... close to busy roads so dogs must be leashed as all times! Did not get shampoo or conditioner in the room and the heater/air conditioner was outdated. The bed did not have a comforter but a blanket with sheets on eitherÂ side. Breakfast was great!"
POSITIVE,"I took my teenage son to Great America and Gurnee Mills for back to school shopping on an overnight stay from St. Louis. We arrived a little after noon (following a six hour drive from St. Louis) and our room was ready for us. We went to the room and it smelled profusely like smoke. I went back down to the front desk and was given another room right away. The front desk clerk informed me that the prior occupant would be charged $150 for a cleaning charge, as the room was designated as a smoke-free room. The room we ended up getting had some wear to the carpet, but other than that, was extremely tidy and clean. The two beds were comfortable and had four pillows each, which is always a bonus to find a comfortable pillow away from home. The room also had a refrigerator, flat screen tv, desk work area, a couch and coffee table, and free wireless. The sink area is separate from the bathroom, which was nice getting ready for the day. All staff we encountered were friendly, and the front desk couldn't have been more helpful-advising us to walk to the park instead of paying the $20 parking fee and telling us about outlet shopping 15 miles away in Wisconsin. There is a small, indoor heated pool and hot tub, but we did not use these. The breakfast area was packed and did not appeal to me whatsoever. I looked for items I could quickly grab and take to the room to enjoy, but there was nothing like that. What I saw that was offered was belgian waffles, cold and hot cereals, and assorted bread to toast. I would have enjoyed muffins and yogurt, but ended up skipping breakfast instead. Coffee, cold and hot water, and tea is available in the lobby by the front desk all day and night. We ended up going to Great America for just five hours (crowds intense for a Monday and the heat index made for a sweltering time). We walked to the park, as suggested, a good mile or so in and out, crossing a busy intersection. By the way, the coasters and rides are crazy great at this park! After returning to the hotel, drove a couple of miles to Gurnee Mills-very easy roads to navigate-and ate at the Rainforest Cafe, shopped, then watched Captain America at the theater. The next day we decided to skip the park due to the overwhelming heat and we headed across the parking lot to Rosati's for lunch (awesome deep dish Chicago-style pizza!) and then to the Jelly Belly tour and outlets in Point Pleasant, 15 miles away. Belly flops for $9 for two pounds and an awesome selection of stores at the outlets. This hotel was an excellent base for a great two-day trip to the area and I would definitely suggest this hotel to others. Room Tip: Walk to Great America from this hotel!"
POSITIVE,"Comfortable, clean, non smoking hotel, room is spacious. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Hot breakfast was delicious with good service. Highly recommended."
POSITIVE,"Our stay in Salisbury was convenient enough for a last minute beach trip to Ocean City MD. Went to the mall ,movies,the beach and had access to good restaurants. The continental breakfast was just enough to get going before check--out. Thanks!"
NEGATIVE,"The staff was nice, however, the outlets in both of my rooms did not work. The breakfast room was not very clean or organized. The only good thing was location. It was not worth the money they charged for the room."
POSITIVE,"I ended up finding out about this place through Groupon, who offered me a deal that I could not refuse. I had never been to anything like this before and me being the adventurous woman that I am, I thought it would be a perfect, romantic date night for the man friend and I. I made sure that I thoroughly reviewed the website so that all of my bases were covered and that I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to do. The website is very easy to use and understand and provided most of the information that I needed, including directions. The over the phone reservation process was simple and the representative that I spoke to was very friendly. I scheduled my reservation for 4 pm on a Saturday evening so that we would be able to see the sunset. Getting to the location was simple and as you exit the freeway, there are plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction of the resort. While they do have vending machine-type snacks on the premises, you are allowed to bring your own food, which I opted to do. They also provide a small ice chest filled with drinks like bottled water and canned sodas that you could purchase, but didn't have to if you didn't want to. The deal that I purchased was good for 2 hours of hot tub time for two and Â included rose petals along the side of the hot tub, candles, and a bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider, which made for an absolutely picture perfect experience. Our tub (# 17) was completely secluded and did not face any of the other hot tubs, making it extremely private. We could not see nor hear anything that may have been taking place in the other hot tubs. There was a small CD Player/ Radio available if you have CDs that you'd like to listen to while you soak.. Initially, I doubted how nice of an experience it was going to be since much of the grounds were undergoing major renovations. But the renovations did not affect our view at all. It was completely beautiful. Being able to relax in a wonderful hot tub that over looked the beautiful Puddingstone Lake with the lights of Los Angeles as its backdrop was the epitome of relaxation. Those 2 hours went by way too quickly. The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. Needless to say, the manfriend was very surprised and enjoyed every second of the time. Â I would highly recommend Puddingstone Resort if your looking for a relaxing escape, or a romantic evening with someone special. We will definitely be back!"
POSITIVE,The hotel was clean and quiet. The staff was very helpful.
POSITIVE,Excellent value for money. Used this hotel as last stop before going to Yosemite park. Simply great!
NEUTRAL,Only has indoor pool. It's right on highway with no outdoor space in sunny ca. It was a quick stopover enroute to Yosemite from sf. Breakfast was good.
POSITIVE,"Clean room. Ice Cold AC,Ice Cold fridge. Great Value!"
POSITIVE,good hotel but little expensive
NEUTRAL,"This BW was a little antiquated; no elevator so upstairs guests need to be able to navigate stairs with luggage in tow. Breakfast room was a little too small to accomodate many folks at a time so we passed on squeezing in. Hostess was friendly and helpful though, always a nice part of a stay."
POSITIVE,A friendly and helpful staff makes for a perfect stay at this motel. The continental breakfast was good as well. I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"From the friendly clerk at check-in to the room to breakfast, everything was outstanding at this hotel! Clean and well updated, comfortable beds and pillows, air/heat unit worked well, bathroom area was clean and neat; staff went out of their way to be helpful-apologized for the couple checking in before us taking ""too long"" (not the case, the wait was negligible), accommodated our room requests, brought a high chair at breakfast without us having to ask . . . I could go on and on. We were so incredibly pleased with this stay!!! Pros: Convenient to food and shopping. Cons: Couldn't check out the pool as it wasn't open for the season-looked like it would be nice, though. Location: Easy to find and get in and out of."
POSITIVE,"Clean and comfortable. Perfect location. Staff very helpful and breakfast was great. Eggs,sausage, fruit and juice. Yum. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"I finally found a piece of home here in the heart of Pioneer Square!! I have been hearing about this place from some time now through fellow yelpers and other friends. Being from Philly I tend to be a snob about how my cheesesteaks are made and prepared. Every one kept telling me this is one of the best and I have tried plenty in Seattle only to be left feeling disappointed and homesick. So, I decided today that I was going to stop by this little shop and get myself a cheesesteak to see if it lived up to the hype. I walked in but they weren't open yet I was soo hungry and determined that I got back into my car with my girlfriend and sat there waiting for the extra 20 mins until they did. I finally saw the open sign light up and out I rushed to order my Philly cheesesteak. I walked right in and this time I was welcome with open arms. Steve and Al are amazing and really took me back home to Philly where everyone is friendly and just like family. We reminisced about the neighborhoods we grew up in as I waited on my steak. I ordered the Philly with mozzerella and fried onions since they didn't have American cheese yet. The cheesesteak was made to perfection. Every single morsel of it. I was soo delighted that it was a chopped steak and finely chopped onion mixed in together because that is how my momma makes it back at home. The BREAD was the best and only something you can get from the Eastcoast. The brothers have it imported in which is a must because honestly the bread is what brings it home. You can't get rolls like that from here. I was super Â impressed by the sandwich. It was packed with so much meat and all for only $8 bucks which is a great price for how much you get. I ate every last bite of it. The brother's are very friendly and deliver great customer service. They took care of everyone that walked in right away and carried on a conversation with me as well. They dubbed me the ""Cheesesteak Snob"" LOL I took it as a compliment seeing that I am harsh when it comes to anything Philly related. They even invited me and my girls back for some pizza next Friday night and I think I am going to take them up on that offer. Seriously, the best Philly Cheesesteak I had in a long time but definitely the best in Seattle. I am definitely going to come here more often just to get a taste of home. FYI: the hours on yelp are wrong. I would give them a call before heading that way just in case they aren't open."
NEGATIVE,Trinity was my first time out in downtown Seattle. I sure hope there is better clubs out there. We waited in the guest list line twice because the doorman couldn't find our name. He found it the second time around thankfully. The place is just kind of trashy... They don't really enforce a dress code and the music is ...meh.... I did have a good time with my friends and the club served its purpose but I wont be going back. The hot dog cart outside however is EXCELLENT!!! after a few drinks. ;-)
NEUTRAL,"Posizione, colazione inclusa"
POSITIVE,The hotel was super. The beds were extremely comfortable and the breakfast was great. We enjoyed ourselves very much.
NEGATIVE,Had to drive many miles for REAL stores etc....hotel was old but redone
POSITIVE,"I had the stuffed tilapia, and it was like eating fine dining. Even the veggies were delicious. Room service was fast. The only complaints I would have is the TV remote didn't work (but I was busy and didn't watch much TV anyway), and they had a poker tournament going on that night, and there was a lot of filthy language and surly characters outside.Â I never heard anything in my room, though. In fact, never heard a peep from any rooms around me. I would definitely stay here again based on the restaurant alone, and the fact that it's quiet in the rooms."
NEUTRAL,Too expensive for the size of the room. Very little room.
POSITIVE,"friendly and helpful staff. room was very clean, comfortable feeling, amenities abundant! continental breakfast, several choices from cereal, toast, waffles, oatmeal, juice and hot beverages."
POSITIVE,"Great Location- not far from the freeway, walking distance to downtown. Friendly staff, very clean well-maintained rooms."
POSITIVE,The staff was extremely accomodating in our 6 day visit. Every day was a full service. The breakfast was hot and good. Popcorn in eves. Room was very clean and comfortable and Bathroom had Great HOT water. I recommend.
NEGATIVE,"two weeks before my business trip, i tried to book a hotel near the Ramsey Courthouse in st paul. Â to my dismay, ALL of the closest and nicer hotels were booked bc there was some hockey tourney going on. Â just lovely. Â this best western was pretty much my only option, so, i booked it. pluses: - fairly close to downtown (but not really w/in walking distance) - friendly staff - nice pillows - the restaurant (Sweetwater Grille) is ok w/ decent prices and good service - fitness room (plus for having one) minuses: - old, out dated room - broken heater (thank God i found myself here on an unusually warm, March day, about 20 degrees above average, said the shuttle van driver, whom was really nice and gave me a free ride to the courthouse, btw. Â yes, i tipped him.) - noisey staff in the morning while they were cleaning the other rooms. Â i was woken up by their chatter. - fitness room (minus for being so crappy) this hotel is OK if you need an average-ish place to stay while in town but for the money (about $170 a night), i've seen much better."
POSITIVE,The hotel is good if you can get to it. The location is so hidden and took me almost half an hour to find it.
POSITIVE,"We have not seen hotel like that . It was a BIG WOW.....! We normally visit KC Legends once a month for family vacation. We have stayed in all the hotels near legends, but this one by far is the best in location,amenities,services and friendly staff. Rooms have in room water bottled system, big 43 inch TV's, Bath & Body works amenities in bathrooms. Pool with slide. Kids had a blast. Wife had massage at thier spa services. And had good time in the bar- lounge they have. Thank you Best Western KC Speedway. Room Tip: Front side rooms face Livestrong Soccer Stadium & Nebraska Furniture Mart. Back Side rooms face the KC Speedwy race track."
NEUTRAL,"On completion of a great holiday in Canadian Rockies, me and my spouse were to catch an early (0600am) flight from Calgary to Dallas; so we moved to this airport hotel. it is almost midway between Calgary city and the Calgary airport.very conveniently located. the hotel is average with clean rooms. it provided us packed breakfast (as we had to leave at 0400am0 as well as complimentary shuttle for airport transfer. good service. Room Tip: rooms on ground floor are convenient to shift the baggage, as the hotel does not provide valet."
NEGATIVE,Old and lousy bathroom. Too much money for what you get
POSITIVE,"Supper comfortable, and well located. Only 10mins from Disneyland Paris by taking the free bus services. A big shopping mall is just over the street, bought lots of fashions there."
NEUTRAL,OK to spend the night at JFK. Shuttle very useful.
POSITIVE,was a very nice hotel in a quaint little town...better than most...everyone was friendly .a/c seemed to not work very well...however it was 110 outside..so go figure...otherwise...great place
NEGATIVE,Bed Carpet Good They have to change the rug for something else Put floating floor or something else
POSITIVE,"yes its only days inn my room was fantastic , so nice i did like it a lot ,"
POSITIVE,"Salami panini. Yeah. Its good. Pizza very tasty. Â Went for lunch, it was quite, would definitely go back."
POSITIVE,The ladies at the front desk was GREAT!!! Thanks Suzanne for the great restaurant Ideas. PS: They need to purchase some new and softer towels :-)
POSITIVE,the only compaint I have about the hotel is the lighting in the hallways and that the towels were rough.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was awesome!!! The room was huge,clean,very cozy, comfortable (we loved the bed,it's a pillow top)...The staff was great and very accomodating. The (free) breakfast was really good. The hotel is located near the oxbow public market anddowntown, which made it convenient. We had a great time on our getaway and a big part of it because we had picked the perfect hotel."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I flew into NY from Phoenix to attend the Kidney Walk, Sunday 10/16/11, starting at South Street Seaport. Â So very convenient for us, and our purpose there. Â I'm originally from NY so we knew our way around. The room was small, but not uncomfortable. Â It had exactly what we needed. Â A clean comfortable bed, clean PRIVATE bathroom, AC. Â The room was modern, with white sheets and comforter, flat screen tv, and nice bathroom with no stains. Â My only complaint if I had to make one......NO view. Â We had a brick wall. Â CLASSIC NY!. Â But hey, you want views? Â Go out and explore!!!!! The hotel its self is almost at the most southern tip of Manhattan. Â A very short walk, maybe a 1/4 mile or less, to the seaport ( a tourist attraction for picture taking and a little NY history), and if you walk a little further you'll be at the Staten Island Ferry, Battery Park (for the ferry to, both, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island), and in the area of the Financial District , World Trade Center and City Hall a little north. Â North of the hotel is China Town and Little Italy. Â  The Hotel is about 3 short blocks from the #6, 5, and 4 train's ""Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall"" station. Â The north bound M15 bus stops DIRECTLY in front of the hotel. Â You can take it up to midtown, via 1st ave, for a lot of the other major sights, if you want to remain above ground."
POSITIVE,"Quality, presentation, service and taste were all five stars. Â We had the $123 tasting menu and it was easily worth more than that considering the entire experience. Â The wine pairing, presented by a master sommelier, was a value at an additional $63. My only complaint was that they would not take a patio reservation, but rather advised arriving early to try and be seated next to the fountains. Â We did arrive early and were able to sit next to the fountains, which added to the dining experience."
POSITIVE,"Beautiful, romantic and next to the Iron Cactus, bonus. Â They serve cookies and milk in the evening. Very COOL! Â My favorite part is the super nice bathroom with awesome tub for two!!!"
POSITIVE,The staff was very accommadating and friendly. The location is great. Shopping was very selective as well. We dined out and the choices were wonderful. Your establishment is very warm and inviting as well as quiet qnd cleqn. No problems we really enjoyed our stay and will stay there again.
POSITIVE,we will return
POSITIVE,"Was perfect location, breakfast came in handy, and the staff was extremely helpful. I'd recommend to people. Probably not the best if traveling with 4-5 people trying to fit in one room."
POSITIVE,Wireless connection in my room was poor. The stay was comfortable. Would stay there again.
POSITIVE,Everything was value for the money spent
NEGATIVE,"We arrived late afternoon for a long-standing reservation after driving 500+ miles - BUT, we couldn't even find a parking spot on the Motel's property to check in!.. EVERY Parking spot was filled, MOST with boat trailers which had dozens of extension cords running to exterior outlets and rooms. There were ALSO boat trailers hitched to vehicles parked in the middle of the parking lot. We finally parked across the 4-lane street and walked over to the office. Since Motel Reservations (unlike most downtown Hotels) INCLUDE a parking space allotted with/for the room, I asked front desk staff person if this was not the case at the Thunderbird Best Western, since we primarily stay at Best Western Motels nationwide 10 - 20 times a year, and this has ALWAYS been the case at every other BW we've stayed at in the last 25 years; she responded, yes, that was their policy. I then requested that she contact the occupant of our allotted space, and request them to move their vehicle to their own spot. This she said she couldn't do - only the Manager could do that! When I requested to speak to the manager, I was informed that she was unavailable! I asked her if that meant that we were supposed to find our own parking spot OFF PROPERTY, she said maybe we could park in the lot of the adjacent restaurant after they closed; since they didn't close until after Midnight and we needed to be gone at sunrise, this didn't seem a very viable option. I went outside in an attempt to ""cool off"", then returned to the front desk, and informed the lady that we would be parking our vehicle in front of the office, and if it was ticketed or towed, the facility would likely be facing a legal challenge. The staff member said that was fine, and she would make try to make sure that it was not bothered. I want to say that the Staff Person was friendly, and seemed genuinely embarrassed by her predicament, but apparently had specific orders from her superior to give the Boaters ""Carte Blanche"" and ""to heck"" with the other customers. I have NO complaint about the Front Desk Staff - my complaint is SPECIFICALLY with the INCOMPETENT and UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT of this facility! Obviously, we will NOT be back!....Incidentally, although I had requested the Manager to contact us via cell phone the next day to discuss the problem, that never happened. Room Tip: Choose a different facility!"
NEGATIVE,"Disliked: Rooms, The wooman on the counter is mean"
POSITIVE,Very comfortable room and the bed was nice. Room service did not restock our coffee or coffee condiments on our last night there.
NEGATIVE,Old hotel in desperate need of an upgrade but with the shortage of hotels in the area that is not likely to happen in the near future. Some rooms are of an interior hall way and other guests smoke there. The smoke is sucked into your room through the A/C and if you are sensitive to this it will become an issue. Other than that it is just old old old and needs to be upgraded totodays standards. ...Pros: Location. Cons: Smoking outside the interior rooms.
POSITIVE,We had a very early flight ...so the fact that this hotel offered parking and a shuttle service to the airport was our reason for choosing
POSITIVE,I have stayed in this Hotel several times. Love the indoor pool and spa. Breakfast is good if you want a fast one. They have updated rooms and everything always seems very clean. I will stay there again when I need a place in St. George Utah.
POSITIVE,Convenient for skiing Everything you could hope for at an affordable rate.
POSITIVE,Receptionist Sherri is very nice and accommodating ..
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Rooms clean not nasty. Skip the food. Go to barbeque resturant for breskfast. Its the locals best kept secret, Good rate. Rooms were a pleasant surprise"
POSITIVE,"This is a very pleasant hotel. I don't recommend the restaurant that is next to it, but the hotel itself is wonderful. It's comfortable, excellent bed, quiet and the rooms are large. I wish it were cheaper, but nothing on the coast this time of year is cheap."
POSITIVE,The hotel was very clean and the morning breakfast was great. I have 2 small children and they love going to the pool here.
POSITIVE,Nice place and very courteous staff. Shuttle driver took the time to get me over to car rental center even though they were very busy - that was above and beyond I thought. AC units are extremely noisy. Really nice pool / spa area and landscaping.
POSITIVE,"When staying in Yorkton one must simply stay at the Best Western; not because it is the newest or the cleanest, but becuase of Lance. His dedication to superior customer service stands in stark contrast with the level of service I experienced with he other front desk staff. He is a gem. Room Tip: Take Lance's recommendation"
POSITIVE,"nice , clean, only problem was smokers outside front door and butts thrown on ground"
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay especially with pets. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great with a beautiful view of the river. Staff was excellent, would highly recommend this Best Western."
POSITIVE,My family and I had a wonderful time here. It is affordable and there is a shuttle to sea world.... Two thumbs up!!!!
NEUTRAL,"Reservation was not ready , desk clerk couldn't find it , I personally had to call hotels .com to verify my reservation , I waited 45 minutes at 3 am while people walked in off the street and got rooms before me,the whole point of using hotels.com was to eliminate the wait, I was very unsatisfied with the treatment I received , the clerk apologized [?] for my inconvenience and once I got into my room it was fine . I just feel it should have been more organized"
POSITIVE,"For the price this hotel it is quite above what was expected. Although the clerks were a bit gloomy, they stay was pleasant, and the beds were super comfy. It looks pretty nice inside."
POSITIVE,Very pleasant and accommodating staff. Take advantage of the wonderful Princeton Hot Springs!
POSITIVE,Friendly staff & spacious room
NEUTRAL,Close to business I was going to. I found the room a bit warm but didn't want to try and figure out how to change temp settings.
POSITIVE,"I been here a couple of times n it just gets better every time! Liked: Rooms, The hot tub, Service"
POSITIVE,"The heater really makes the air in the room dry. Indeed the air was very uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what you can do about it."
POSITIVE,"Pleasant staff, well appointed, good breakfast, sent items I forgot to me."
POSITIVE,"Couldn't have been more pleased; the room was clean, spacious, and well appointed and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly."
POSITIVE,We stayed here during a blizzard that closed I-25 northbound. The room was very clean & the bed very comfortable. The staff was excellent especially the nice lady with the English Accent. She went out of her way to make out stay enjoyable. The homemade soup in the evening was a nice touch. It tasted really good with the blizzard going on outside. The hot breakfast was also good.
POSITIVE,"Good place stayed two weeks for work. Very clean Liked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,"Location, room, bed size, breakfast with excellent service, affordability, cheerfulness of all staff. Our door to our room would not shut. I only found this out when I tried to shut the door at night for the evening. I had to use the bolt to keep it closed. It was reported to the front desk upon check out."
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff begin your stay, just short stroll from the park entrance and Downtown Disney. The free parking until 6pm is a bonus. The room was clean and reasonably quiet. Good view of the fireworks from the 3rd floor."
NEUTRAL,"This is a fairly average and ordinary hotel. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms need some remodeling and the location (right next to the freeway) is a bit noisy, but the noise dies down once you get inside the room and turn on the a/c, and being near the freeway was actually helpful for me because I was staying there for work, so it made getting out in the morning a breeze. The pool looked nice, although I didn't get to use it. Good place to stay for a quick business trip or if you're looking for an I expensive place to stay near Magic Mountain."
POSITIVE,"Good value clean hotel with friendly service. Pros: Clean and comfortable room at good price. Cons: Hotel lobby fountain was not working, gave a bad appearance as it is large."
POSITIVE,very good hotel nice and clean food was excelent. i will go back there next time. very good i give 10 star.
POSITIVE,Nice room for the money. Very clean and comfortable. Would stay there again.
NEGATIVE,Disliked: This place is way over priced 150$ and tv remote dosent work mngt says fix it your self
NEGATIVE,The beds were awful...you could literally feel e springs in the mattress when you lay down. It was a clean place and convenient for where we wanted to be but if you want a nice comfy bed keep on driving.
POSITIVE,"Very nice staff, clean rooms and excellent breakfast. Good location and parking. Would stay again when in the area,"
POSITIVE,Windows on doors in main lobby area where very dirty and did not make a very good first impression.Pros: Close to Airport. Close to shopping. Cons: Access from North bound interstate 29 on 13th Ave was difficult as there was not a turn lane into the hotel without turning around.
POSITIVE,We found this hotel met all of our expectations. The breakfast was a must on our list and it met our needs. There was coffee available on our check in but wasn't very hot. We'd choose this hotel again for our Albertville/St. Cloud shopping trips.
NEUTRAL,Nice clean hotel. Close too airport. Good breakfast Pros: Free breakfast
POSITIVE,We stayed here in aug. And I was traveling through the area in sept. with a friend and we stayed there... She was very impressed.
POSITIVE,It's our first time in NYC and we based our decision to stay at the distrikt on the tripadvisor reviews. We stayed 9 nights at the distrikt - very friendly staff. I told them it was my birthday and they greeted me with a birthday cupcake in the room. - free wireless which is fantastic for doing research / bookings for things to do. We had no definitely plans but knew roughly what we wanted to do. - hotel is across from the port authority so there is no issues with catching the subway or walking to anywhere. Times Square is just down the road and so are all the restaurants on 9th ave. - Our only con if we are to be pedantic is that housekeeping was a bit touch and go. sometimes they would leave us chocolates sometimes not. By the end of our stay they stopped giving us spare toilet paper and we kept running out. LOL i know thats a funny thing to complain about but its a basic need. Apart from that our stay was great. Room was on the small side (apparently tho this is big for NYC) but you're in NYC. You don't need to stay in your room!
POSITIVE,"Friendly helpful staff, proximity to airport. We stayed at a $300+ hotel in ct and were treated far ruder than at the Best Western."
POSITIVE,"It was very convient for me to accomplish the things I wanted to do. The Hotel was pleasantly 'more' than I expected, specificly the Lounge and Dining Room were both Superb as were all the employees. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Bob C."
POSITIVE,I stayed at the BEST WESTERN Avalon Hotel last week and the customer service was outstanding! If you are looking to save some cash than book it here HotelDealNow.Info I saved like $50 by using that site!
NEGATIVE,"Worst mattresses we have ever slept in. Liked: Location, Service"
POSITIVE,A comfortable room and pleasant staff. Thank you.
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and love the location. However, this time service at reception was not good. They gave me a room and key but when I entered I could see that it was already occupied with someone else's luggage. I was horrified at the thought that it could have been my room that another person was given a key to. Good thing thatÂ I am not a thief! Also, parking instructions were poor so I ended up parking at the back of beyond in the garage."
NEUTRAL,It was neither wonderful or terrible. Don't try to sleep in late. Train tracks across the road. Over all it was good.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here in mid-November 2011. It's always difficult to know where to stay because quality can vary. We were pleased with our choice. The rooms were very clean and reasonably-priced. Lindy at the front desk was great - genuine and caring. Breakfast was very adequate. No complaints whatsoever. [I am in the real estate/vacation rental business in Panama City Beach and have an eye for quality. As such, I can tell when people are trying hard and this establishment seems to be.]"
NEUTRAL,The hotel is OK. The indoor pool is fun for the kids but the entire facility reaks of chlorene.
POSITIVE,We have stayed at this hotel a number of times before. It is very conviently located especially to the hot springs pool. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very nice and clean. It is getting a bit dated and needs some updating. It is a very nice hotel and we will probably stay at this hotel again.
NEGATIVE,"This was our third stay at Derwent Manor - an annual family get-together on the first weekend after New Year. This was our most expensive stay at Â£92 for one nights b & b although others in our party stayed two nights to qualify for Best Western's winter sale at Â£72 per night. The hotel facilities are first rate which is why we have returned each year. We chose to book an evening meal in the restaurant at Â£22 per person for a 3-course meal (excluding tea & coffee ) and given the hotel's boast that ""our Head Chef prides himself on using only the freshest & where possible local produce to create some outstanding cuisine"" we had high expectations. What a disappointment! Cheap miniscule prawns (or were they shrimps?) in the prawn & cucumber salad starter which could be consumed in three mouthfuls ( a Â£1.95 supplement on two of the starters did give sufficient quantity ); one main described as tarragon marinated fish fillets, new potatoes, and a spinach cream turned out to be one small Asian fillet on three new potatoes cut in two. The steak was a little better but had a Â£4.95 supplement although the black peppercorn cream was like water. The puddings were good thankfully but service was lacking i.e. we had to ask for a wine menu and the starters arrived before the drinks, one drink never arrived, & had to ask for cutlery and steak knives. All very chaotic and then to add insult to injury, we discoverd there was a belated new years party being held that evening which we could have attended had we been informed, at Â£12 per head including a four course meal!!!!!! We did complain & some recompense was offered but any apology felt insincere and spoilt the good memories of previous stays at Derwent Manor. A reasonable breakfast but served luke warm."
NEUTRAL,"It was available during when I made late arrangements. Like the improvements and upgrades. Easy to get to, meet our needs. Staff at front desk was too busy talking to other staff members when we checked out to help us."
NEGATIVE,darn Wallace ! I am ready for summer !
NEUTRAL,Great place to stay for the price !1
POSITIVE,I had no problems every one was helpfull the bed was comfotable lots of pillows
NEUTRAL,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting a really great experience at this hotel, but was sort of disappointed. Our suite was large but that was about it. There was a large kitchen space with lots of empty drawers and cabinets. No plates or utensils. The sheets were not smooth, you could tell that they were cheap and had gone through quite a few wash cycles. The free breakfast was not anything to write home about. The one thing that I really liked about this hotel was that instead of little bottles of shampoo and body wash, they had dispensers in the shower and next to the sink. This cuts down on waste and provides you with enough of a product that you can actually use."
POSITIVE,"The Best Western in Rutalnd is not elegant but it is roomy, clean, friendly and close to Rutalnd, killington & Pico ski areas. We stay here several times a year and always enjoy the suite with 2 beds in the bedroom and a pull out couch in the living area. There are full kitchens for cooking in after a long day of skiing. in the summer, enjoy the outdoor pool and the tennis courts. Room Tip: Suites are big enough for a family of 5, add the connecting bedroom and get 2 more beds!"
NEGATIVE,"noisy, bad beds. only breakfast deserves the stop."
POSITIVE,Sweet! It's time for some warmer weather! Ha!
POSITIVE,"We stayed here one night over Labor Day weekend enroute to CA. The room was large, clean, and had everything we needed. Good wifi (get the password), a friendly clerk at the front desk, a big TV, small refrigerator & nice, thick towels and an awesome shower head made this a restful oasis for us. The breakfast was standard BW, except for the weird looking scrambled eggs which resembled popcorn and were inedible. Elko is not exactly a garden spot, but there are lots of casinos if you are into gambling. We walked to dinner down the road at JR's Bar & Grille. I highly recommend their buffalo chili served with hot rolls, only $5. Road construction made the walk rather dusty."
POSITIVE,"For the price, you can't beat the service and rooms."
POSITIVE,Had problems controlling the heat vent. Otherwise our stay was without problems. Hotel is outstanding.
POSITIVE,"Great rooms with nice interiors. Gym, pool, waterside, and breakfast are an added bonus!"
POSITIVE,Real nice not used to the small rooms/hallways very slow elevators!!!
POSITIVE,"The checkin was fast. The night clerk was fast. Pointed out to me, I had a headlight out and may be ticketed if not repaired. That was appreciated,(who checks lights?) Refridgerator and micro in room, also great as I don't use ice in my cooler in the car. Billboards along highway tell the milemarker of the motel. Room was clean and stairways were clear [?] of obstructions, ( I always like top floor). Rate was fine with me, for the amenities received."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Pool is open all night and is warm! Good, hot, free breakfast."
NEUTRAL,"It was fine. I didn't realize the doors would be open to the outside. I didn't see anything on the website that indicated that. So I was a little disappointed in that. The bathroom was clean, so that was good."
POSITIVE,Hmmm..thats good to know!
POSITIVE,All personnel friendly and helpful. Breakfast menu very good
POSITIVE,Liked: Rooms
POSITIVE,"Everything was fantastic. Liked: Rooms, Staff was very friendly!, We had an issue with one room and they promptly moved us to another room., Continental breakfast exceeded our expectations."
NEUTRAL,the hotel is very nice and confortable. Breakfast was very good. The hotel is large and has a lot of walking to get to car and meals.
NEGATIVE,"Not good.Pros: Bed was comfortable. That's it. Cons: Cleanliness, food, staff sarcastic/ not helpful, neighborhood, star rating incorrect, age of hotel, stains on carpet, old furnishings and finishings."
NEUTRAL,"Clean rooms, good breakfast, friendly, helpful staff. There is no entrance off of the main road."
NEUTRAL,"Pros- Complementary breakfast was nice and the room clean. Cons- Beds were like sleeping on the floor with sheets (stained my back some) and they could use a few more cable movie options (only one HBO channel and no in-room movies to choice from). Pretty basic room for the price, overall. Next time to Dumas, I will probably try a different hotel- mainly for the bed."
POSITIVE,"It had everything we needed, it was clean even in corners.Pros: Location, clean, everything we needed. Cons: TV placement was hard for second person to see."
POSITIVE,"Great staff. I had to have some paperwork sent to a co-worker who didn't have a fax machine. A manager went out of his way to go across the road to scan and email it for me. Clean and comfortable rooms. Liked: Rooms, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"Pretty nice seen better for the price.Good breakfast.. Liked: Service, Food, Location, Value, Rooms"
POSITIVE,On the water. Great views.
POSITIVE,"I was very impressed with the room. Large, beautiful wood floors, nice pine furniture, interesting artwork, and very comfortable beds with nice bedding."
POSITIVE,Great view of ocean....room very acceptable
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,Pretty decent hotel....only thing irritating was we couldn't play our ps3 on the tv it has a lock....we travel with our game....but other than that the kids enjoyed swimming all day....
NEUTRAL,"Quality of food very bad, diluted orange juice that doesn't taste like orange and same with apple juice, coffee is like water. Price is good. Liked: Service, Location, Value Disliked: Rooms, Food, Stinky"
NEUTRAL,Room was quiet. Conveinent location. Could use some new carpeting and the coffe maker didn't have all the parts so was not able to use it. Price was a little high.
POSITIVE,Pros: The staff was very nice and helpful. Cons: When you turn the AC on the rooms smells like sewer.
POSITIVE,"Large suite Noise Loved Russian River Brewing Company Overall I liked this hotel. It was very comfortable and clean. I had a suite and it was a good size for my baby to crawl around. The walls are not sound proof, but that wasn't an issue for us since we sleep with a sound machine."
POSITIVE,"Everything about our stay was excellent! The Inn is conveniently located on hwy 70 near 63, and walking the quaint streets of downtown Spooner is just a short distance from this Best Western property. A recreation trail is alongside; Wisconsin's natural beauty surrounds the town and setting. The room was immaculate, beds were very comfortable, and it was quiet. The breakfast provided was typical, yet sufficient. Friendly helpfulness was evident from the staff, not only to our group, but also toward ""walk-ins"" who needed to find another lodging, because this BW was full. While we did not use the beautiful pool or hot tub, it appeared to be one of the better areas for these activities, when compared to other hotels. Recent updates were evident; this was the best Best Western we've experienced! Room Tip: We are unaware of any questionable areas."
POSITIVE,The room was not very clean when we arrived but was taken care of immediatly
NEGATIVE,"I was looking for a decent economical place to stay for a night. I got a lot more: this was a very good hotel, not the budget place I had been looking and paid for. I will stay there again, if I should return to the St. Louis area again."
POSITIVE,"We come to the central coast often to visit the grandchildren. We usually rent a home for a week at a time, however the El Rancho is a great alternative for a short stay. Great golf at Morro State Park and Taco Temple is worth the wait at lunchtime. Room Tip: The pet-friendly room was just a clean and nice as the regular rooms."
NEUTRAL,"This is an older hotel with exterior entry doors. The room was basic, but did have a mini-fridge. I had limited interaction with staff, but they seemed fine. The only real issue I had was all of there info cards said the breakfast ended at 10 AM. On Saturday morning I went to the breakfast area at 9:35 and was told breakfast was over, it ends at 9:30. The attendant was nice enough to let me make a waffle and grab some juice before she shut everything down, but it just seems these kind of thing should have been made clear at check in. The surrounding area is rather empty; the ""golden arches"" are on the corner and there is a pancake house just up the street but that's really it. If you just need a place to stay for the night, like the title said-it'll do."
NEGATIVE,"Please stop offering this hotel as a 'secret deal' on Expedia. This is hardly a one-star hotel. Here are comments on our stay for potential customers and Expedia. The room smelled of sewage. A train runs on tracks across the street between 2-4 a.m. every morning. Room heaters are almost as loud as the train's whistle. Combined noise reaches close to 100 decibels. Quite the challenge to get back to sleep--particularly upon experiencing the smell of the room again in your vulnerable, tired state. The free breakfast was not very appealing. Choice and quality of food was marginal. After the first day, McDonalds was a better choice. Our plastic keys would work one time, and then need re-programming. We ended up creating a track between our room and the front desk. The back lot behind the hotel was scary, making us move very quickly while travelling between our car and room. Next to the hotel there is a strip of vacant buildings which no one should walk near at night. The staff was polite, but the lack of comfort of our stay was unsalvagable. Please take our advice: DON'T STAY HERE....EVEN ONE NIGHT. Pros: Leaving. Cons: Staying there. Location: Dangerous, noisy, close to railroad tracks (noise), remote, beat-up side of town."
POSITIVE,"Awesome customer service, clean hotel from enterance to bathrooms and breakfast area. Beds were very comfortable and we stayed warm throughout the cold, cold night. NO complaints at all. Very good experience"
NEUTRAL,"Just a note to say that this Best Western is clean, friendly and located well. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was always well stocked."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed here now for 4 years plus and continue to make that my home away from home while in the Seattle area. Great place, excellent staff! Lee Sang Gen Manager, Mo great guys, front desk etc. Great folks! Nice clean quiet rooms, always consistent! I always stay in a Jacuzzi suite. Nice suites some on the river side. Anytime all year round itâs a nice place to hang out. In room wet bar and dining area. Free coffee in room, microwave, and frig. Perfect for a getaway, business trip or just jelling out! Huge TV, Lots of channel choices. Nice! Very comfortable bed. Marble bath counter, Love the Jacuzzi. Even the ladies that maintain the rooms are excellent. They are always accommodating with extra coffee, Towels etc. I personally love this place when in the Seattle area. They all know me personally, so let them know Heartflight highly recommended you to visit. If you really want a treat and I am not staying there, ask for Heartflightâs room (Melâs) room. They will have a laugh and know you read this! Highly recommended and close to shopping center, lots of restaurants, Costco etc. Some great dining right in that area. Great dining!!!! So stay one time, and you'll see why I love the place and call it home. Tell them Hi for me ask for Sang Lee GM or Mo. Have a nice stay! You will! Heartflight Room Tip: Ask for Heartflights suite! on the river side!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was resonably priced, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the heated pool was amazing. I only have 2 problems with my stay: 1) the breakfast was sub-par. The eggs tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. 2) because of the location of my room (at the end of the hall), the WiFi was scetchy and it was hard to keep a solid connection. Other than that, I definetely recommend this hotel. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value Disliked: Food"
POSITIVE,Location & staff No microwave for young kids meal
NEGATIVE,"Was there for the Florida vs. Ten game very rude Front Desk clerk Elizabeth, room was dirty the carpets need cleaning my feet were black after 15 mins in the room. Will not be coming back heepre again."
POSITIVE,it is located right next to IHOP. actually in the same building. there is places to go for food within 1 mile radius.
POSITIVE,"We just moved into the area and needed a place to call home for several days. The rooms were super clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the breakfast was plentiful and tasty.."
POSITIVE,"big room, large balcony, very clean,nice view, great beds, this place is the perfect place to stay."
POSITIVE,We just needed to stay here on our way home from Lake Tahoe and it was nice and clean! The rooms were updated and clean. We loved the continental breakfast it was a great way to start the long way home
POSITIVE,Front Desk Staff was very Corteous Room was very Nice and Clean We enjoyed the Pool Breakfast was very nice Room Tip: Room was very Nice and Clean See more room tips
NEUTRAL,Watch your bill. I was overcharged by $30 without warning.
NEUTRAL,"I was surprised to see two faucets in the shower. there should have been a single handle, pressure compensating valve. When other people used water, my shower temperature changed. The light, in the shower was held up with wire, and didn't look safe. The hallways were all under construction. The stairs were steep and scary. There were no regular pillows [?] on the bed, just square, bulging ones. The breakfast did no have a lot of healthy choices- fresh fruit, whole grain breads, etc. All the dishes and cups in the breakfast area were make of polystyrene foam, which give off plasticizers, which can leach into food."
NEUTRAL,"Booking this motel (two months before arrival) was a nightmareâno one was at the desk for hours. The check-in process was cumbersome and we must have encountered Dianne on a bad day because she was abrupt and curt when my husband asked where the dog park was located. The room was adequate, large and comfortable, but fairly average in most respects. The shower head was way too high to adjust. The breakfast room is a bit small and cramped and the breakfast is unexceptional. What we love about this place is that there are two convenient parks for dog-walking nearby (five minute drive). But even better than thatâthe Gourmet Garden Buffet adjacent to the property is to die for. Seriously. An incredible variety of foodâall you can eatâfor about $6."
POSITIVE,We stay here often and it is always quite and comfortable.
POSITIVE,"It is clean, easy to find, close enough to downtown without being in the mix of everything. Close by Wal-Mart and eateries. Close to the attractions we were in town for. Nice staff. Reasonably priced. Have stayed there twice and would again.Pros: Free continental breakfast is amazing. Lots to pick from and fresh!"
NEUTRAL,"Clean rooms, good free breakfast, Great park and fly location. Andrew the night manager was very nice to deal with"
POSITIVE,"Location, clean, friendly, easy check in and out."
POSITIVE,We were stranded in Denver due to snow storm! Very nice accomodations and staff as well as shuttle drivers were very nice!
POSITIVE,Stayed here during a hotel convention. Rooms were fair. View was great. Overall a good value. You do have to navigate through a smokey casino to get around. Room Tip: I chose an upper floor to get away from the noise. Had a great view in Tower II
NEGATIVE,"Our budget is limited with a family of five, there is only 3 of them and they are on an expense acct."
NEGATIVE,The staff wasn't as helpful and friendly as they should be. The room was dirty. Housekeeping doesn't seem to be doing their job. Pros: The only think I liked about this place was the free breakfast and the complimentary social hour. The bartender was nice and helpful. Cons: I did not like the room or the room decor. It was old and dirty. The lobby area was a bit more modern. but not as clean as it should be.
NEUTRAL,This hotel was very generous with supplying breakfast and the amenities in bathroom as well as a free newspaper. Could use to update the dining facility.
POSITIVE,Wallace is a big reason we come back... always have a great time in Chicago ... Wallace makes us feel welcome and has the best insight on the happenings around town!! Wallace is AWESOME!!
POSITIVE,We enjoyed the locality of the hotel so easy to get to Time Square Fashion District and the amount of food places close by are good From cheap dinners to bars to top end steakhouses. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Very happy people. The rooms are clean and some have great views and the decor is modern without being in your face. Great place to stay
POSITIVE,"The room was lovely and the food was good. The only incident that spoiled my stay was when I used the swimming pool and was enjoying a swim on my own , when a young waiter decided to lie on a lounger ina suggestive manner which made me feel uncomfortable , and therefore cut my swim short."
POSITIVE,The room was great. We really liked the high ceilings and fireplace. The breakfast in the morning was very good. We had a room that we entered from outside and the there was a very bad draft from the door and the lite fixtures in the bathroom. We like to bring a media player when we travel so it was disappointing when we realized there was no way to hook it up to the tv it had no audio video connections for external devices.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for a business conference, and was surprised by how great the customer service was. The room was very comfortable and the hotel itself is just lovely."
POSITIVE,Enjoyable comfortable clean hospitality convenient. Pros: Availability Cons: NA
POSITIVE,"I think this was a nice hotel for the price. I got a package for the Casino in the area which included Casino credits. The room was clean and accomidating, also attended a Conference the next day and the conference facilities were very good. I will be returning to this area as a tourist and will stay here again."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I were traveling through the area February 2nd and decided to stay in St. Cloud, MN. We drove past several hotels but decided to stay at the Best Western Plus Kelly Inn, we usually stay at Best Western Hotels. The moment I walked into the hotels' lobby I was impressed with the neatness, cleanliness and the manor in-which the lobby was decorated. The cleanliness continued into our room (364). We met two desk clerks, Morgan and Janna. They assisted my wife and I with our check-in requirements with outstanding customer service. Later, I returned to the lobby and requested more assistance from Morgan and Jana and received the BEST customer service! They both assisted me without thinking of themselves or asking for anything in return. Both went above and beyond their call of duty. I would like these employees recognized for their outstanding customer service! Thanks to them my wife and I both had a wonderful stay at your hotel. We will continue to stay at Best Western Hotels!"
NEUTRAL,"Booked this hotel with our sports team, stayed in the family room with 2 queens and bunkbeds. Very large room and it was very clean. We could here our neighbors TV very well and everything they were saying. The bathroom is small and the sink is on the outside. I did find that the shower head was very low, would be very hard for someone who is tall. The girl at the check in counter was really friendly and helpful. The rooms are across the road so going for breakfast you had to walk across the skywalk. There is no continental breakfast but they did give us coupons for free breakfast in the hotel resturant. Also the pool is in the center of the hotel rooms and it was very loud, you could hear everything. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the pool as some roooms face the pool on both floors."
POSITIVE,Large clean rooms with nice furniture. Check in took less than a minute with very friendly staff. Breakfast could have had more opions for such a nice motel. Very pleased and would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here 2/27/12, for the first time - we were in Rm 121. Our room was immaculate, and had a large window looking out onto a grassy area. All rooms are non-smoking, which pleased us. We ate at the on-site restaurant, and were pleasantly surprised - not only really good foods, well presented, but also large portions (we could not eat it all). The Inn is located near I-10, but not so close to hear the traffic noises. We would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others."
POSITIVE,No shampoo in the room which was disappointing as I had not brought much. Light bulbs at bedside were out. Shower was nice. Breakfast was generous. Pros: Convenient and handy location for volleyball venues--cheaper than resorts for one person Cons: A few details were missing as noted above. Also a long way to the lobby Location: Great
POSITIVE,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff. Fast check in and check out. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Loved everything about it. Will stay here again."
POSITIVE,"The Pioneer Inn is a lovely hotel in the heart of Lahaina. We had stayed here before and had experienced great service and a nice visit, so we decided to have our friends and families stay here with us for our Maui wedding celebration (our wedding was at the Five Palms in Kihei, a beautiful restaurant, but we wanted to stay in Lahaina because it would be much more fun overall for the rest of the trip). At the Pioneer Inn, we had rooms overlooking the Banyon Tree and rooms overlooking the courtyard, both were pleasant and no street noise issues, particularly with the AC running - we didn't hear a thing. We all loved having a little fridge in our rooms, we made good use of them. Sitting out on the lanais was a great evening activity, just watching town activity, but once our door was closed we didn't hear a thing. Having rooms next to friends was kind of like a suite but with more privacy, because we could easily hop the lanai railing to get from room to room (Steeple Chase!). The staff is friendly and helpful, the cleaning staff did a great job, we had no complaints in our group of 17 people. Just lots of happy guests all round. Our guests from Canada, USA, and UK all loved the Pioneer Inn. This hotel is not as fancy as resorts in Kaanapali, but it you ask us, it is a lot more fun, has much more character and it is better to be in the heart of Lahaina than in the sterile resort environment that costs 3x the price. The breakfasts (and dinners) that we had were super tasty and good value. Many great activities leave from the harbour (right out front) or if we went to hang out down the beach it is just a short walk to great spots for swimming and laying about the sand. The restaurants and shops in the area are fantastic, we really recommend trying the ribs at Mai Tais restaurant and checking out the Five Palms restaurant too (they have a new location in Lahaina). Reading some of these reviews, I found it unfortunate that people felt their room was muggy (it is Hawaii after all but they obviously didn't turn on the AC), or that one had to climb on a chair to reach the air conditioner. All rooms we used (9 reservations) had remote control devices for the air conditioners. They are set out on the dresser with the TV remote. Worth note, these guys keep their furniture clean. I don't always unpack my luggage and use the dresser, but after close inspection I was happy to do so at the Pioneer Inn. My ONLY request would be that they add a bathroom fan. When we first entered the room, it didn't have AC cranked (understandably), so it was muggy - I don't know that I'd hold this against them since every hotel I've ever been to requires that you turn on your own AC when you enter the room. Within five minutes of AC the room is comfortably cool, a nice respite each time we came home from shopping, beach, meals, events. No complaints from us, we love this place and will certainly be back, as will many of our friends and family members. Excellent value, great service, and loads of charm."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is well positioned on US41 - right beside the Naples Plaza with a large Publix and Marshalls. There is a`Walgreens and Panera across the road and a Red Lobster next door. The beach is a fifteen minute walk away - while downtown Naples is a five minute drive along 41. Hotel doesn't look much from the outside, but the units surround nicely landscaped gardens with two separate pool areas - adequate number of loungers and seats are available. There is no restaurant or bar. Breakfast is served outside continental - fine - but I don't know what happens in poor weather ! Front desk staff (Johnny) very helpful. All in all very good value. We had a suite - which was very spacious with a good sized fully equipped kitchen, living/dining space with two settees and access to balcony, large bathroom with twin basins and bedroom with walk in closet area containing safe. All very clean and comfortable. Room Tip: Suites look to better value"
NEUTRAL,I was nicely greeted upon my arrival. My room was all ready for me . The room was nicely cleaned and quiet. The TV had to be set-up anytime it was turned on. It was an older model. The hot breakfast was nothing to get excited about.
POSITIVE,"Book early for discounted rates. Rooms were clean n comfortable, free breakfast every morning is a nice bonus. Drawbacks: current construction to install an elevator, wifi had to be reset several times before it would work, bathroom sink had a leak that got my socks wet. Once the elevator is working; it will be great! It was hard lugging our bags up [?] n down the stairs. I love staying here!"
POSITIVE,Had 3 day reservation.....when arrived no non smoking room available. Room clean but very smelly. Management made no effort to contact me and remedy the situation. Many vacancies the second and third night. Perhaps this was just the front desks oversight......Very uncaring! Food good. Entry doors always needed cleaning.
NEUTRAL,Rooms were nice & clean. However couldn't get any hot water to take a shower with!! I got warmer water out of the sink and washed off in the sink. All this when it was about 32 degrees. Not happy with not having hot water!
POSITIVE,"Everything was perfect! Oh, the parking spaces near the loby were smaller than the cars...made it difficult to get in and out during registration."
POSITIVE,"I think that this hotel was one of the best on the strip, but pricey for what you get. Our maid service lacked the cleanliness that we thought should be given at this hotel."
POSITIVE,"We went for the Canton Flea Market and this was the closest place we could find. I read the reviews and was why I chose this Best Western, not one bad review! Clean, quite and comfortable."
NEGATIVE,the young couples that worked in the hotel were great and added to our enjoyment of our stay. the shuttle was very handy for getting downtown and back as well as to the airport.
NEGATIVE,"Room had most of the features we wanted: 2 queens, refrigerator, and microwave. It did not, however, have a pull-out sofa bed as Expedia indicated. Room doors open to parking lot which was convenient but noisy-- didn't get the best rest with all the noise from people talking outside and driving. Beds and pillows weren't as comfortable as I'd expect in this price range but not terrible. Check-in was not the most pleasant-- the guy complained about me using Expedia instead of Best Western's own site repeatedly. Check-out was much better and breakfast was good. There are many other hotel options within a mile to the north-- would try another next time."
POSITIVE,The hotel is located close to shopping & restaurants. Very clean comfortable facility with nice rooms. Staff is friendly and helpful when called upon. Bang for the buck this establishment is fantastic. Would recommend to others and will come back for sure.Pros: Clean & comfortable. Cons: Our room faced the highway and the road noise was annoying.
POSITIVE,Large comfortable rooms old elevator Great location just off the interstate Front desk staff and housekeeping were very friendly and helpful.
POSITIVE,"This was my second stay at this property and I have been pleased with the room, the service and the amenities both times - good value for a good price and so convenient to dining, shopping and right off I-44."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is clean and great if you are in MN for the Mall of America. It's right across the street. We had a poolside room. The pool is great and would be awesome for kids. Nice, new, soft beds. Excellent sleep. Quiet except for the power toilets. Room Tip: Ask for a poolside room on the first floor if you have kids. You have a sliding glass door in your r..."
POSITIVE,"Easy check in and out. Close to almost everthing. Had to park in open lot or garage across the street. Parking fees a little pricey, but our car was safe in the parking garage over night. The room was a little small, but was what we needed. All in all was a good spot to stay. We will go there again."
POSITIVE,"Came to Gonzales to check out their Come and Take It weekend and stayed here. It was a great stay, the staff were friendly and helpful. They made my visit to Gonzales a memorable one, and I can't wait to come back next year. Room Tip: Get the suite....it was very comfortable and roomy."
POSITIVE,Clean comfortable room. Beautiful view. Will stay again should business call us back into the area.
POSITIVE,The hotel was in very good condition and the location worked out very well for our trip
POSITIVE,"Spent 5 nights here in October 2011, my husband had informed them that is was 60th birthday during our stay. There was a bottle of ""bubbly"" in the room and a cake when we arrived. The complimentary drinks were great each evening, and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Great place to stay."
POSITIVE,"The service was definitely the thing at this little property. The hotel is not really something to write home about; pretty standard chain stuff, although fairly nice for that. But everyone we met who worked there was great and willing to go out of their way to help us. All-in-all it was a nice stay at a convenient location for a decent price. Room Tip: There are only two levels, but no elevators. If you have trouble getting around, go for the 100s. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"It is a Best Western, so don't expect 5-star hotel service, but it was an enjoyable stay. The staff was very friendly and did all they could to make us ""feel at home"". I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,Very comfortable stay. Nice and quiet.
POSITIVE,"Lovely hotel, staff were so accommodating and we cukd not fault the room."
NEGATIVE,"Would never go there again, and seriously question.Pros: Room had a refrigerator. Cons: Rooms were all upstairs--way upstairs, pool in the basement. So, two huge flights between."
POSITIVE,"The paintings in the laundry room, the light pattern that shined on the wall in the evening, and the pictures on the walls in the lobby. The fact that the pool was not heated, and that there weren't any screens on the bathroom or bedroom windows. Located just minutes from where we wanted to be on Hollywood BLVD. Location, location, location, baby!!! The hotel was very very accomodating when we asked to be near the friends who had already checked in. In fact, we were in the room next door!! I have two complaints about the hotel - 1) the pool was not heated and it was supposed to be, but that didn't keep the kids out of the pool; 2) the laundry facilities is only one washer and one dryer, so timing is essential!! I loved the paintings in the laundry room, and would have taken pictures of them if my camera hadn't run out of battery power. All said, we would likely stay there again as it is very centrally located to Hollywood, Sunset, and Santa Monica Blvds."
POSITIVE,"Just off 81 easy access. Very clean comfortable room (#225) end unit nice and quiet. Priced great! Front desk staff very nice and helpful Liked: Rooms, Service, Location"
NEUTRAL,"Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value Disliked: Food, Atmosphere"
POSITIVE,"I have stayed in this hotel three times not and just wish for a designated area outside for smokers. We hated walking through the smoke and having to inhale the smoke as others were smoking outside. Thank you. Pros: The breakfast was fresh, hot, and enjoyable. Staff was helpful and friendly. Cons: The one bed in our room was not comfortable for the person sleeping in it. It sunk to the middle."
POSITIVE,"We stayed only one night and found the room very comfortable and relaxing. We stayed in a King suite which was a bit cramped with the layout but still very comfortable. This hotel was much better than the Days Inn accross the street. Tried the mineral spa which was nice but not quite hot enough for us and the pool had already been closed for the season. The hotel is situated within the Hot Springs Park area so all the commercial pools (one with a slide, 1 full pool outside and 12 full pool inside and small hot tub areas) and free ""state"" springs are a quick walk away. Very nice surroundings -- grass, trees, deer, river walk and thermal springs walk. Staff was very nice, too. Would definately stay here again. Room Tip: There are many different layouts so you may have a choice if there are availabilities."
POSITIVE,Very new and modern facility with good amenities.
NEUTRAL,Room was clean and the bed was decent.
POSITIVE,The University Inn is a nice place to be after a football game. It is especially nice to have a restaurant inside the hotel. It is a little pricey for the age of the hotel but I would still stay there again.
POSITIVE,"Best Western would be my home while visiting the Museum of Aviation, at Warner Robina, Ga. Check in was quick. Each person at the front desk greeted me with a smile. Of the six motels I stayed at during an 18 day trip, this motel would be #2. Room was average size. Finishings consisted of king beds, table with two chairs,chest of drawrs, two small end tables on each side of the beds., Mico/fridge. The tv had 70 plus channels. The bathroom was largest of any stay. I do mean LARGE. The bedroom leads straight into the bathroom. Plenty of space to walk around and on both sides of the sink. Enjoyed the shower. Towels were abit larger than average and not so scratchy. This facilityn has a coin operated laundry.,A machine is available for softener. However I needed to buy detergent from the front desk. If staying, consider bringing your deterrgent. My door opened directly the parking lot, with my vehicle jusdt eight feet away. Im prederred this to a hallway. The morning I left rain was falling, so no long walks out to a large parking lot. The motel does have plenty of space on both sides. To the south, within walking distance, across Watson Blvd, is a mall, with Lowes and a Wal-Mart. To the north, is a larger mall. Nearby is a Longhorn Steakhouse. Try the fresh Rainbow Trout, followed with an Old Fuge Sunday. Also nearbr is a Hardy's. Breakfast is dry cereal, muffins, donuts and a waffle maker. With apple/orange juice and coffee. The lobby opens for breakfast at 6:00 AM. A PC is in the lobby, with no set time limit. Rooms are cleaned daily.verall, my room was vvery clean. The air coditioner may have been a bit noisy. With the temperature in the mid 80's in early September, the unit needed to be used. For a two day stay, only $129.00, one of the best rates of any motel stay., For this amount, I enjoyed a comfortable bed, clean room, in a quiet neighborhood.. Watson Blvd. is a four lane highway. During my stay, I heard little road noise. My stay was during a weekend, which could be the reason for low sound. There is areason Im didn't give a five star. For a soapdish, I uses a large plastic cup top. The first morning I left a note stating: 'Pleae donot throw out the plastic top'. The afternoon I returned, the top was gone, I have since starting using myn own soap dish, incurring no problems. If I were to return to Warner Robins, I wouldn't hesitate to make a reservation. Jack L., Syracuse, New York."
NEUTRAL,"The outside if the Hotel looks old and in need of some TLC. When we entered the room, we were pleasantly surprised due to the look of the exterior of the building. Breakfast was worth staying to eat."
NEGATIVE,"I've stayed here several times even though it really isn't in the best neighborhood. The location suits my needs for a quick getaway to Houston, though. Until my most recent stay, everything had been fine. Never great. Never awful. Pretty much what you would expect from a mid-priced chain motel. However, on my last (and I do mean LAST) stay, my wife and I checked into a Jacuzzi suite and went out in search of dinner. After dinner, we came back ready for a dip in the hot tub. Well, there was more tub than there was hot. In fact, there was no hot. No hot water was to be had in our suite. I called the desk and was told, with a bit of attitude, that they would let maintenance know about the problem in the morning. No offer to change to a room with hot water, either with or without a Jacuzzi. I explained that we would be up and gone before maintenance was available the next morning. Well, she said, she would let the manager know, too...in the morning. I called Best Western customer care and while they seemed sympathetic, they were impotent, as ""each location is independently owned and operated."" Further attempts to get to the bottom of the situation resulted in an admission by the motel that they were at fault and an offer to refund 10% of the charge. Excuse me, but I paid twice the regular room rate to get the damn jacuzzi that provided no value whatsoever and then we had to take cold showers the next morning. I don't think $12 is quite going to make up for that. That was all they had to offer, though. Take a moment and imagine my response. I got the (apparently useless) Discover Card folks involved and will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, as well. You can tell a lot about a business by how they handle a situation gone wrong. I understand that these things happen. Breakers trip and water heaters no longer heat water. If that happens to a paying guest and you value their business, you should go out of your way to make it right. Obviously, this place doesn't value my business. Don't expect that they will value yours. Room Tip: Choose a room at another motel"
POSITIVE,Nice spot. Very friendly staff. Excellent room layout. Breakfast was nicer than most. Several very noisy contractors who were working on the building were a nuisance until 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. There also seemed to be some low flying aircraft noise. Overall a better than average value
POSITIVE,After visiting the Mayo Clinic we found out we had to stay longer. Went back to the hotel and spoke to the young lady at the desk who told us that our room had been extended until Sat. We asked for a room with microwave and frig for the same price and the same room price. Checking with the desk because the hot water pipe busted and if we would get credit [?] and he did. Then came the surprise that she did not extend the room. The person said he would make contact with her and of course she denied everything. That truly hurt because we believed her. She truly deceived us and then lied and said she told us there were not room. Which she did not. Truly disappointed.
POSITIVE,"The Best Western in Granbury is not on the lake, but we preferred it that way. The sign is hard to see because the hotel & sign sit lower than Hwy 377 n/b road surface; however, once you get familiar with the area, it is amazingly easy to reach. It is convenient to the restaurants, shopping areas, and just a mile either n/b or s/b on 377 leads to a [?] connector road (either 144 or 377 business) to the historical town square in Granbury. Granbury is a unique step back in time and caters well to tourist trade. There are no parking meters in the historical areas, and ample parking. There are events going on nightly, and entertainment abounds. The Best Western hotel is not part of the historical area or at the lake, which gives the guest a quiet atmosphere for rest and privacy, but within a short distance are all the ""lake"" fun one could desire; and all the other amenities. The indoor pool and hot tub/spa make for a relaxing time to re-energize yourself for all the events taking place around Granbury. If you want ""lake"" fun, any type of rental equipment can be had just down the road from the hotel. We plan to make this an annual stop, if not more frequently. We highly recommend the Best Western Granbury for a great ""get-away"" spot."
NEUTRAL,"Beds weren't extremely comfortable, but were ok. Breakfast bar didn't have a lot of variety, but was ok. Price was good."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel several times since it opened. The rooms are always clean, well appointed and comfortable and the staff is excellent. And, for the money, this is a good deal in Bastrop."
POSITIVE,We wanted a hotel close to the Wharf. This place was an amazing find. The room was beautiful. The staff was super friendly. We could walk to the trolley & Ghiridelli Square. And the Italian theme was charming. I recommend this to anyone I know traveling to San Francisco.
POSITIVE,"We just returned from 3 nights at the Mariemont Inn, near to Cicncinnati and had a very good stay. The hotel is a throwback to the old English Edwardian era, with lots of heavy furniture and dark wood and architecture in keeping with that era.(1900's or thereabouts). Our room was very large, with a comfortable king bed and sitting area. The bathroom though small was modern, but with vintage touches and a great walk in shower. The front desk staff were always very friendly and helpful, as were the housekeeping staff whom we encountered. The area around the hotel, called Mariemont Village is quite delightful, with a couple of good restaurants and a few interesting shops, nice deli and bakery, and even an icecream parlor and an old fashioned cinema, all within a minutes walk of the hotel's front door. The residential neighborhood is very pleasent for an after dinner stroll, and lots of families and people were out walking, jogging, biking etc. It was a very sweet visit, unfortunately cut short by illness, but we will certainly look forward to staying in this hotel again, when we visit family in the Cincinnati area."
NEGATIVE,"We stayed 4 nights on the review that this was a boutique hotel with an Italian flavour, what a misnomer. The hotel is definitely not boutique, rather a large chain tourist transit hotel with no atmosphere and little facilities. If it were not for the excellent Cafe Pescatore (attached) there would not even be a hotel bar. The room was very small and below par. If you want to get any sleep avoid the rooms facing the street the 24hr noise levels were appalling. The daily managers wine affair was a joke with run of the mill wine and no where to sit. The valet parking was exhorbitant at $50 a day and the reception staff had to be reminded to take off my $5 a day AAA discount even though they were told at check in. Overall a huge disappointment the only positives being the Cafe Pescatore and it's close proximity to Fishermans Wharf if you want to be in that area. Room Tip: If you really do have to stay make sure you book a courtyard room if you want any sleep See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is located in the middle of a nice neighborhood in Little Rock and is very convenient to the major highways. It is next to several shopping centers, restaurants, and office buildings, and the parking lot is well lit and secure. The only complaint we had is that the vending machine was out of bottled water during our stay. Seriously, that's the only complaint, and it was easily remedied by a trip to the convenience store up the street. The pool area is very nice, and the in-hotel restaurant looked fantastic though it was closed on the Sunday night we stayed. The rooms are large, have a separate seating and entertainment area that includes a dry bar, mini fridge, and microwave. The work area was comfortable and the WiFi worked well. Every staff member we had contact with was very nice and helpful. The full, hot breakfast served every morning in the atrium was quite nice. Over all, a first rate experience for about $100 less per night than any of the hotels downtown. We would definitely stay again."
POSITIVE,"We were stopping through to visit a family member before heading to Ft. Walton Beach, so we did not want to spend a lot of money but we did want a nice clean spot to lay our heads. This place looks to be brand new and was only $71.00 for the night with AAA. It was also close to a lot of dining. The rooms were awesome and the staff was even better, there was a guy at the front desk sorry can't remember his name but he said he was the general manager's brother. He went above and beyond for my family he helped make the waffles for my son and made sure fresh coffee was there for my in-laws, and took a couple of family pics for us. All in all this was one of the best places I stayed in a long time. Especially for the money."
POSITIVE,"Very quiet, clean grounds, buildings and rooms filled with Ponderosa pine trees. Staff was friendly and attentive, but I didn't need their services. Everything was exactly as expected and in excellent condition. Will gladly put this at the top of my list of recommendations for friends staying in the area."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our California honeymoon. The hotel's location is convenient, but in a very touristy area. When we checked in, it was (unbeknownst to us) Fleet Week but the staff was quick and helpful. The Hollywood Cafe just down the street is great for breakfast. The daily wine tasting is good and they pour nice big glasses. The rooms were adequate (pretty small, as described in many reviews, but clean, which is important). We had an inner view which was a quieter room but we seemed to look onto someone's apartment so our shutters were closed the whole time. The interactions we had with various staff were very good. The concierge Jackie was excellent and gave a lot of helpful advice. We also had to ask for help with various issues (smoke detector, extra hangers, fridge, and thermostat), and the staff was quick to respond and helpful. The hotel wasn't cheap, but seems to be on par with San Francisco prices. Overall, great: staff/service, location, daily wine tasting, Jackie the concierge. Adequate: room itself."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here one night. Hotel seems new and the room was spacious, clean and had a nice bathroom. Free parking, nice TV in room and free wireless internet were definite amenities. The surrounding area does not seem as nice as this facility. It's about 4 or 5 miles from Miami International Airport. The fitness center was nice but its equipment could use some updating. My only complaint involves the advertised ""free breakfast"" which was included during the online reservation process and in the in-room directory book. Breakfast is no longer free (nor cheap). When I asked about it at the front desk I was told in a somewhat indifferent manner that there had been a change in policy starting October 1st. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"We were guests of the Denton, TX Best Western Premier for three days in early November. This is a well appointed, pleasant hotel with a staff to match. We occupied more than a few rooms and all of them were excellent. We got to know the staff and they accomodated us in every way. We especially enjoyed the morning buffet. We had the most interaction with Rosetta, Sam, Jenny, Georgia, Rosalinda & Antonio but there were others who treated us just as nice; we were not able to get their names. We plan on traveling to Denton regularly and will always stay at this hotel."
NEUTRAL,"I checked in on the day of the second game of the World Series. I booked my flights around the game and chose this hotel because it's near the airport. The channel on which the game appeared did not work, and nobody seemed to care. Hotel employees couldn't even agree on whether they has cable or satellite, but only advised ""it's out of our hands."" Nobody [?] took responsibility for getting it fixed."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel for Thanksgiving since my family lives in the area. The girl at the check-in desk was very nice, and let us check in at 11am, even though we weren't supposed to until 3pm. The hotel looks and feels brand new, and the rooms were very clean. The beds were a little hard for my taste, but not horrible. The breakfast wasn't that great, the bread was a bit stale, and they had sausage, bacon, and eggs that were in a warmer together, so they all tasted pretty much the same. They also had fresh fruit, cereal, and waffles. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel, and would stay again!"
POSITIVE,"We went there for our honeymoon and reserved their suite. We got there and they were so gracious and kind. We went to our room and there was a beautiful floral arrangement and bottle of champane on ice for us. The room was immaculate and clean the bathroom was spacious and had plenty of towels. the Kitchenette was stocked with matching plates cups full flatware etc. large coffee maker microwave and sink. The lounge had hot coffee and lemonaid 24/7 and a computer if you needed one (we had our own and they have free internet service in all rooms) The landscape was perfect and manicured, with flowers plants and bushes. We were right near the bridge to cross into Assiteague Island where the ponies are. the McDonald's is across the street for kids. The Pharmacy and resturants are all close, and most are very good. The people and staff at the hotel were so kind and informative I can not say enough good about them. I would recomend this hotel above all others and would like to thank them for such a wonderful stay. Room Tip: Call well inadvance especially in the summer See more room tips See all photos"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Brunswick Baymont Inn and Suites on our way to Jacksonville for a cruise. This hotel was easy to find, had plenty of lighted parking, and our room was a pleasant surprise. The room was large, with a couch, coffee table and chair. There was also a desk, flat screen TV, microwave and small fridge. The bed was very comfortable. The front [?] desk staff was friendly, professional and helpful. We did not take advantage of the buffet breakfast. This was a great place to stay, get a good night's sleep, and be on your way. Next time through we will probably stay a bit longer and take in some of the historical sights."
POSITIVE,"Very nice accomodations in a little bit run down area. Room was great. Comfort was great. Flat screen would have been great except for the cable being messed up on our stay. To their credit, it would have been a 5 had that not been a problem, AND they did have someone working on it and even fixed it but not until too late in the evening to matter for [?] our single night stay. All in all, it was a very comfortable stay with a fantastic hot breakfast in the morning!!"
NEUTRAL,Room looked recently updated so it was looked very fresh and clean. Was not a large room but I was only there for one night. Breakfast area was very small and the selection not very appealing - could have used fresh fruit or yogurt. The fitness area was not maintain - equipment was not working. If I just needed a nice clean spot to sleep I would stay [?] here again.
POSITIVE,Last minute search online and very pleased with the result. Close to our needs and very pleasent staff. Would recommend this hotel to any tipe of traveler.
NEUTRAL,hotel great for truck drivers
POSITIVE,"Just needed a one night stay over. Room was excelent for price. Located directly on beach and close to many restaurants. Has some age on building, but room was clean."
POSITIVE,"Friendly and helpfull staff, Big beds, close to subway, free wifi, free parking, free printing, free breakfast... breakfast is ok for US style, not really continental.. roomrate is somewhat high.."
POSITIVE,this is our 3rd year staying here when we go to am I-Cubs game in DesMoines. We have had good service and nice rooms..... we will be back next year
POSITIVE,We loved this place. The room was super clean with all the nice little amenities. The ocean front view was fantastic. The beds were quite comfortable and we didn't have any complaints at all. Worth every penny. Room Tip: Best to book directly with the hotel during the off season for lowest rates.
POSITIVE,"I had a pleasant stay at BW. I stayed at BW for ten days. The staff was very accommodating especially Brenda. Brenda put a smile on everyone's face and always kept the food full for the guest. The rooms felt just like home with the rooms separated for families, which I did not need but I'm not complaining. I would definitely choose BW again."
POSITIVE,"It was New Years Eve and we checked in early so we could take a cab $5 to the club in DC, then at the end of the night, take a $5 cab ride back to the hotel so we didn't have to worry about drinking and driving. My husband had his suit but had forgetten his tie and we would not be allowed to enter the club. We had to do a little coaxing, but finally [?] the front desk clerk let us borrow his. He saved our whole night! All of the workers during our 2 day stay were polite and courteous, the cleanliness of are room and the hotel was wonderful. Loved it! Will use again for any drinking in DC excursions from now on (its amazing how many there are)."
NEGATIVE,"When we first got up to our room the first thing I realized that this was not nearly as clean or nice as expected (having stayed at a BWPlus before). I went to take a shower and realized that we had no shower curtain. We called the front desk and they were very quick to get one sent up. I tried to shower again only to realize that we had no hot water. Someone was sent up quickly, but an hour later we still had no hot water and were finally moved to another room (at 11:30 at night and after my son had fallen asleep). The next day housekeeping took our dirty towels, but didn't leave clean ones and the last morning that we were there my sister's room flooded. And for the trouble of her belongings getting wet they knocked a whole $20 off her bill! Unacceptable!"
POSITIVE,"Overall a good experience. clean rooms, helpful, staff and great location."
POSITIVE,"Short of the alarm going off, it was OK. We thot it would be within walking distance of downtown Williamsburg, but it was too far away."
POSITIVE,"The area where this hotel is located is right next to the 101 free way . The neighborhood isn't fancy but you are only there to sleep. I was concerned about it being too loud at night because of the major freeway . First the hotel is actually well kept, clean, the rooms were very clean , you can tell they bleach their sheets, the rooms are clean , and it was quit the whole night . The breakfast wasn't fancy but had the fruit, cereal, and waffles and it was free so you can't beat that. If you are looking for restaurants, there is a San Mateo down town area which is a 10 drive , you can't walk there...This hotel is very clean and a great hotel to stay for business."
POSITIVE,Our room was spacious and very clean. The full breakfast was plentiful with fresh fruit. The employees were very gracious and friendly. We would stay again!
POSITIVE,"I stayed in Blackfoot because my mother had surgery at Bingham Memorial hospital. After staying up all night with her, I headed to the Blackfoot Inn for an early check in time and a nap. Ryan at the front desk was extremely helpful. He put great thought in to finding a room in a location where housekeeping would be done with their vacuuming and noise making.He helped me carry my luggage and make sure I was satisfied with the room and location. The room was large and clean with no unpleasant odors. The bathroom looked like it had a fresh coat of paint. The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. The towels and bedding were high quality. I had no trouble sleeping several hours during the middle of the day as the darkening curtains did their job. The cooling/heating system works on a thermostat and was very quiet for a wall mount. The breakfast was adequate and contained a fair variety of items especially for the price of the room. It was a pleasant addition to an unpleasant reason for needing to be there."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has the best service you could find. The rooms are super comfortable, the restaurant is delicious, the staff is always nice, polite and professional. The hotel is sooo close to Downtown Disney you can walk to it. The shuttles to the parks are always on time and they provide an excellent service. Overall, everything they promise, they deliver. You WILL enjoy your stay at this hotel. And it has great price, what else could you ask for. :)"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was one of the nicest in the area and no it's not ON the beach. The walk to the beach is not far, maybe less then half a block. The room was very nice and staff courteous to us and more than willing to help. The continental breakfast was good, about what I expect for a free hotel breakfast. It was nothing fancy just waffles and cereal, nothing says you have to eat there. My girlfriend and I were there for her birthday and could not have been happier. The bed was a king and very comfy, the room was not large but your there to sleep. I did a lot of research on the hotels around here and for the location this one was the best. Plus the price is really good and just 5 minutes from town. I will stay there again with out hesitation."
NEGATIVE,"I have stayed at lots of Best Westerns over the years and have had decent customer service, this is the exception. I called and made a reservation, gave them my visa card number and then called and cancelled. They charged me anyway, even though I had cancelled days before. When I called to cancel I did not receive a cancellation number and thought nothing of it, that is right up until I got the bill in the mail. I immediately called and spoke to the general manager and made her aware of the situation and her response was ""it is hotel policy, with out a cancellation number there is nothing I can do"". Really? I have booked and cancelled lots of hotel rooms and never have I then had to quote a cancellation number. I'm pretty sure that the clerk who took the cancellation was busy and just didn't enter it into the computer system. Now I get to go through the VISA process for an unauthorized charge and spend hours of my life trying to rectify the situation. I'm going to be sure to never stay at a Best Western again and tell everyone I know about this issue. Poor customer service, but atleast she had a nice voice. Room Tip: find a different hotel"
POSITIVE,"Looks fairly new, staff was nice, room was clean, price was right. I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was very nice. I thought it was just as nice as a high end notel but the price was just right. The food, well it was not great but hey it was enough to hold you over for dinner. I would definitely stay there again. Dont forget to tip housecleanning."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel was relatively clean (although hotel is an old one), secure, and everything was in working order. Hotel surrounding is a bit noisey with trucks, traffic, morning activities banging away every morning, though."
NEUTRAL,Easy to reach location even for person without the knowledge of this area. My Room was 1st Floor facing the major road so at night I get to hear the silen of embulance. No Barrier from outside so you can see inside the room from outside without the curtain.Room itself is clean and had enough space.Problem is my phone wasnt working. I got a maintance man came to check and still had problem. We also had a problem with Free Internet Access. Service was down for hours. Also Hotel gave me the number to call so I had to make a call and since my phone isnt working I couldnt receive the phone call.Front did ask me if they want to change the room but since I already stuff out so I didnt change the room. Pros: Location near the major highway and next to shopping center Cons: Broken phone and not able to receive the internet access when needed Location: near the major highway and next to shopping center
POSITIVE,Service was great! Rooms Great! Breakfast Great!
POSITIVE,"Within walking distance of good restaurants. Room key didn't work on outside door. Nice for short stay, would stay there again. Close to main thoroughfares and easy access to them. Close to good restaurants (those found at many traveler's stops). Quiet room."
NEGATIVE,"Hotel overall was ok. The beds in the room were very uncomfortable, the one had a significant lean to it. The hallways were cold, which didn't help the walk back from the pool. The pool itself was ok and the hot tub was enjoyable. Staff was polite and helpful. I certainly would not rate this as a ""three star"" hotel. Pros: Hot tub Cons: Beds Location: Mt. Pleasant, Michigan"
POSITIVE,Stayed here several nights on business. The desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. Reliable wifi. Convenient to local restaurants and shopping. Recommended.
POSITIVE,"Some views not perpendicular to the ocean. We read the reviews and got an ocena view with balcony onthe the 4th floor. 2 Q with 1/2 wall divider acting as small kitchen with microwave, coffe maker and refrig. from sitting area of sofa bed , coffee table small table and 2 1/2 circular comfy chairs with gas fireplace. We really enjoyed sitting and looking out over the ocean. Actually enjoyed looking at the cars driving around on the beach. Grasslands between hotel and ocean but nice dirt lane access to beach. No other hotels abutting th property so felt very spacious. Lovely room with double sink vanity outside bathroom and nice sized bathroom. Did not hear any neighbor noises. Elevators. Breakfast with hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles and the rest of usual breakfast makings. We didn't use the pool but seemed pretty small, and jaccuci. Very friendly and helpful staff. Plentiful and easy parking, Calm cleaning station in the parking lot so I guess good area for clamming. Convention center and restaurants nearby. Other guests said teh restaurant in the hotel was very good. Room Tip: Top floor with ocean view. I loved the fireplace too! The sitting area was especially nice."
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Gold Rush Inn hotel is very cute, very confortable , very warm and clean. Besides that , Golden Pan Saloon is excelent , offering a good food, good breakfast, good beer , good music... We loved it. Ronaldo and Izilda Room Tip: Higher floors have less noise"
POSITIVE,Nice and clean great for the price
POSITIVE,"My family and I had a very pleasant stay during the Christmas holiday at Best Western Plus Kings Inn .Our room was very clean, the location was good and convenience, it was closed to shopping malls, restaurants and skytrain. The rate was good because we stayed more than 3 nights. Staffs were very friendly and helpful. I was initially skeptical about the exterior entrance to the room - I would have preferred an interior hallway - but I got used to it and never felt unsafe because they had security over nights. The breakfast was the typical free hotel spread. All in all, I think we got more than our money's worth. I'd go back."
POSITIVE,"Beds are comfortable and plush, tub is huge and clean, great toiletries, and super breakfast with options hot and cold!"
NEGATIVE,"hard to find, set back far from the main road The exterior and lobby looked promising, but the room itself was a disappointment - dated interior, cold (had the heat cranking all night at 88 and it took until the next morning to reach a reasonably warm temperature), and the old-school TV did not even work (it wouldn't turn on)!"
NEUTRAL,"Location and breakfast offering. Hard bed and old TV. Easy access to lots of freeways. Room is a little outdated (old TV, hard bed) but value for the price is consistent with the class of hotel. Included breakfast is good."
POSITIVE,"The comfortable mattress and pillows made for heavenly sleep. The yummy Continental breakfast filled us up for hours. No elevator for upstairs rooms, at least I didn't notice one. I also didn't look for one. Near Fillmore Historical Museum, Train Depot, Antique shops and Restaurants. Fillmore is a charming small town, refreshing, hospitable, and relaxing. The room was very quiet. We were in the building away from the street. The room was very clean and attractive with new furniture, flat screen TV, microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. I was so grateful for the full size ironing board and iron! The mattress and pillows were so comfortable. We had a great night's sleep. We enjoyed the delicious continental breakfast. The Manager and his wife are very gracious and helpful. They make the stay very pleasant. The hotel rate was very reasonable."
NEUTRAL,"It was for my parents visit. they stay there for 9 nights. Nice breakfast with hot pancake. Room is clean. Only one drawback was the key of room kept expire and we had to get it renew the first 2 nights. Room Tip: I book the room through one of those popular booking sites, but I find out later booking from the hotel web has the best rate."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed in this hotel a few times, mostly because it is pet-friendly, on our route, and offers rooms with microwaves, refrigerators, and whirlpool tubs. (very important to this weary traveler!) The room was clean and spacious. There is a lot of traffic noise because the highway is very close, but you can use the HVAC system as white noise and it will not bother you. The free wireless internet worked well. There is a fair amount of grass in back of the hotel for walking the dog. We really appreciate this hotel allowing dogs! My only issue with this hotel was the bed. It was too hard for my taste and they use a plastic mattress cover which made it very hot after a few hours (plastic does not breathe). If I had realized it was there I would have removed it before I went to bed, which might have helped the bed a little. We did not stay for breakfast, but it looked like they had cereal and donuts, nothing super but better than nothing. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping a short drive away. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the highway."
POSITIVE,"ALL OK, HOTEL CLEAN STAYED THERE NUMEROUS TIMES THIS IS WHY WE RETURNED."
NEGATIVE,Not bad for the money I guess I expect a little more. I think it needs a good spring cleaning.
NEUTRAL,"Stayed one night. No discount for Disable Veterans, only AAA, AARP.Room was about nornal size. Towels were very thin, they had a cat setting on a chair in the breakfast area. Ok unless you break out when cats are near. They have free drinks 7pm to 9pm, is about the only good thing about the place."
POSITIVE,"We were honestly worried about even staying in Billings after reading some of the TA reviews. I felt obliged to write my first review to ease concerns of other travelers. We decided on this Best Western and were relieved when we got here. Great service at the desk, incredibly clean room (including the hygienic TV remote) and a comfortable bed. Only $79 on a Friday night after a long day of driving made it a deal, too. Our first time in a Best Western and we would definitely stay here again if travels bring us this way in the future."
POSITIVE,This Best Western was the nicest I've stayed at. The premises was large and spread out; the lakeside location just across the street from a Safeway was very convenient.
POSITIVE,"We stayed for eight days and got a good sense of the facility. The well lit parking lot tends to get quite full as the evening progresses. Good reception with cheerful staff on duty. We had a quiet suite overlooking the parking lot of the Kwatlen Polytech. Very good comfortable bed with flat screen tv in the bedroom. Fairly quick free wi-fi. Small and poorly lit sitting room with a 1980's style tv could use some improvement. Some signs of wear and tear as well as an amateur paint job on the trim. There were paint drips and smears all over the HVAC unit and wallpaper. The rug could be steam cleaned as there were some stains on it. Good free breakfast was available in an undersized room so that at peak periods, seating was hard to find. Average fare but the products were almost always in stock. The attached ABC Restaurant was well below standard with high calorie out-of-a-package food. Room Tip: Try to get a room overlooking the Kwatlen parking lot."
POSITIVE,"We love this place. We have traveled to Woodland fairly frequently in the past two years. THe first trip, we stayed at the hotel across the street from this one. It was TERRIBLE, so the next time, we tried the alternative because the location is very convenient for our needs. The room rate is consistent, the front desk and housekeeping staff is always cheerful, polite, and helpful, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and the surroundings are quiet so we get a good night's sleep. Room Tip: Rooms at the back of each wing are slightly quieter in the evening because many people use the pool between the wings. Also, rooms further from the front parking lot are quieter in the mornings when people are checking out and leaving. However, the difference isn't huge, we are always pleased with the lack of noise at night."
POSITIVE,The beds were comfortable and the pillows were as well the water takes a while to heat up Its not too far from mall etc but not in the middle of town It was a good night at this hotel except for the restaurant (Toucans). The hotel was great.
POSITIVE,This was a very nice Best Western. It was clean and well kept. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.
NEGATIVE,"Let me preface the review with some back info. My friend works for a party that deals with this hotel on a regular basis. This was acknowledged from the onset at the CS desk. Even so, one of the ladies at the front desk (assume it was the owner) would not accept my friends valid discount (he was told upon booking there would be no issue.) Being a few hours from home, we decided to eat the difference and stay. Since we arrived before the 3 pm check- in .. were told to come back and that a room was already being held for us. Keep in mind, we inquired twice on this matter. We returned after our engagement around 8 pm to find out we had the last room in the hotel facing the highway. Our reservation requested a quiet area. Upon inquiring on the promised room from earlier, the cs woman, Pinky, stated there was no such request. To make matters worse, the rate was twice the amount quoted from earlier in the day and nothing could be done without manager approval. At this point we decided to just go home. Being our cancellation was not within 24 hours, we paid for the night. The next morning, our bank balance reflected an amount TRIPLE the rate. I immediately called the hotel and was told Pat (the manager) would deal with our issue. Pat called back and reversed the charge on our debit card to the agreed amount. The following day, there was ANOTHER charge to our card reflecting the triple amount as before. When I called to speak to Pat, she was never around (conveniently) and avoided my calls. I spoke briefly to the owner, who upon hearing my complaint stated the inflated charge was to cover any incidentals. Incidentals?? We never stepped into the room! Even so, the hotel is mediocre at best with no real incidentals to speak .. unless you count the pay per view movies (which I'm not sure they offer) and long distance calls. For the amount they charged, I'd have to watch every pay per view movie three times over and call Europe. After speaking with the owner for about 3 minutes, she HUNG UP on me. Granted I was irritated whilst speaking with her but not at all rude or condescending. It took repeated calls to the hotel and a call to my bank to have this settled. In using my debit instead of our credit card, we had to wait for the charge to post before the bank could reverse the charge. After 3 days it posted, with another couple days for the hotel to credit the amount owed. Can only imagine how this scenario would impact one with limited funds in their account. Not only that, but this is how they treat people who do business with their hotel on a regular basis. Cringe to think how others are treated."
POSITIVE,The hotel was close to the Romp to Stomp event. It was clean and provided a great breakfast
POSITIVE,"The hotel was beautiful!! Also, had a lot of great amenities for the cost. The only problem I encountered was the location. Apparently, there is a GPS address that is not listed here on the site. I drove around for a half an hour trying to find it. I will defenitely stay here again. Overall it was a GREAT HOTEL!!!"
POSITIVE,"I was surprised by the linens of this hotel, much higher quality than expected. The room, especially the bathroom is small, but the cleanliness was impecable, and the breakfast selection much better than the average for this range of hotel; wide assortment/ selection and very nicely presented and tastefully. No other hotels to speak in the area too."
POSITIVE,Secure and quiet. A little pricey compared to others. But you get what you pay for. Burbank is Burbank. Bob's Big Boy just down the road had a very cool vintage car meet. It was fun and found by accident! I always stay there when in LA. Friendly staff and a very decent breakfast.
NEGATIVE,"hahha.....its funny when you say this hotel would or should get any star at all. My mum was there yesterday night, she was tired when came to this hotel expecting that she would be helped by the front desk agent...but unfortunately the front desk staff was not helpful at all....they lacked providing a full service to a guest or they are never trained to do so...my mum doesn't know English well, and since it was her first time by herself staying outside in any hotels she wanted help from somebody to take her to the room and show her how to open the door....but they straight up denied...ALSO second mistake they did was by checking her in a room, which already had guest in there....how embarrassing this incident is for the hotel property...I think I would not recommended this hotel to anyone in million years...I wonder how many people would face this same situations...If this matters to owner of the property I think they would take a action against the staff who did this...and if this matters my mum check-in at 6:45am....THIS PROPERTY SUCKS...."
POSITIVE,"Large room, location, and quiet. It was convenient to most everything. It was a great hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Great breakfast. Room was comfortable and large. Very quiet. We will stay here again."
NEGATIVE,"Checked in late and went right to bed. We almost left right away, but checked on tripadvisor and saw the good rating and thought we were being to critical. After waking up and took a closer look, what a mistake. Bed spread was dirty. The bathroom had a slight pee smell. The floor wasn't vacuumed (at least the outsides hadn't been done in a long time). The mirror was looked like they took a towel to clean it. Smudges. The breakfast bar was closed at 9:15. Not even coffee. The little coffee maker in the room had terrible coffee. I was very dissappointed in other travelors reviews. This one didn't do justice. Won't be back!!!"
POSITIVE,"I booked a room for two nights at the Best Western Mayport while attending meetings in the area. The check-in and check-out was easy. The room was clean and had a coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. The breakfast included coffee, cereals, toast, eggs, waffles. There was good WiFi reception all over the hotel and plenty of parking. The hotel was updated several years. If in the area again we would certainly stay at the Best Western Mayport."
POSITIVE,"I wanted to rent a room that had a kitchen and TV, sort of like a mini apartment because I live with a lot of people and just wanted some space to myself for the day. My best friend and I watched 6 movies straight through, ate delicious food, including the continental breakfast :D"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night and I have no complaints. It was an average hotel room and seemed clean. I liked the motel style so we could park right outside our room. I also liked that Dennys that shared the parking lot- easy to grab food late at night. The breakfast was ok, they could have had more variety but we got enough to fuel up for the day. I would definitely stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Casa Grande again, as long as the price is right."
POSITIVE,"We were just staying overnite from airport but shuttle service was above expectations..Kudos to Oscar, our driver, and all the help from management storing our luggage. The lounge meal was very good amd service excellent. We will certainly stay again!! Thankyou."
POSITIVE,"Great location, new, fresh, very comfortable beds, great breakfast included!"
NEGATIVE,"When I checked-in, the desk attendant asked where I was from. It happened to be the town where he went to military school and he proceeded to say how awful my town was and he hoped he never went back there again! I specifically asked for a room with no smoking and no smokers around. First night was ok, but the next evening, I could smell smoke out in the hall and in my room all night. I felt horrible the next day being I am allergic. The walls are very thin. If you have neighbors that stay up late you are out of luck. You have to sleep with TV on and bring some earplugs! Pros: Great price! Cons: Smoking in non-smoking areas, very thin walls."
POSITIVE,Hotel was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was good - enough to get us on our way for the day. Staff was extremely helpful!
POSITIVE,"Only live about 40 miles south but needed to stay for our daughter's basketball tournament. She only had about 20 min. swim time due to playing 3 games, but it made her day. The continental bkfst was awesome!! Gave her the energy to play 3 more games on Sunday! Was very impressed at how beautiful and modern the place was. The staff was very courteous. Thanks!! Pros: Location Cons: That we didn't get to utilize the pool enough. Location: Great place close to shopping."
NEGATIVE,House keeping was very poor and the overall value of the room was very expensive compared to other best westerns we have stayed at. Room Tip: Make sure yiou get a non smoking room
POSITIVE,??????????????????????????????????Wifi?????????????????????????????????????
POSITIVE,How can you improve on excellence?
POSITIVE,"I found my room to be quite satisfactory. The bed was comfortable and the nights were quiet. Very easy access to the freeway, east or west."
POSITIVE,"The hotel itself was nice, and the room was quiet. Not at all like the other reviews that I've read with the paper thin walls. The check in process was fairly quick and the person at the front desk was polite. The room I stayed in was supposed to have a queen pullout couch in it but it did not. The parking lot was a little small for my taste but thankfully [?] I was able to get in early to get a space. The continental breakfast that is provided was quite nice with a large selection. Overall I would recommend this hotel although it is a bit far from most things. Again thankfully I was visiting family in Crawfordville which was about 15 minutes away. But if you don't know your way around the staff is very helpful in directing you to where you need to go."
POSITIVE,"THE STAFF WAS VERY POLITE AND HELPFUL, AND THE FACILITY WAS CLEAN. I WOULD DEFINITELY STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN."
NEGATIVE,"everything went wrong from shuttle service to check in, to room too cold and heat turned off and no blanket. decided to stay there as they had a bar, but it closed at 10, not 11. took 25 minutes to check in as a receptionist did not show up. key card did not work, etc."
NEUTRAL,"Ventura, Ca. is an eclectic town with music venues, art shops and great restaurants, especially along Main Street. A friend and I wanted to find a hotel close to the action that was reasonably priced but modern and clean. We did not find that in the Best Western Plus Inn of Ventura. It is a run-down, 1970's style hotel that does not even have an elevator. Really, if the name has PLUS in it, there should be a few things to brag about. Sorry, this is not a place I would stay again. Room Tip: Look for another hotel."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I recently spent our anniversary here and our experience was simply wonderful. Check-in was a breeze and the hotel was clean. Our room was spacious with comfy beds and a beautiful view. The happy hour in the Cebu Lounge was amazing and our sever, Rhonda, was very knowlegable about the different wines available. We really enjoyed our free breakfast and the entire staff was friendly. Great hotel!"
POSITIVE,"Just returned from South Texas and spent a night in George West Tx. It is a very small town with a lot of construction. We stayed at the Best Western at the corner of Hwy 59 and Hwy 281. The motel is an older one that has been refurbished. Our first room smelled of smoke so I call down to talk to the woman at the front desk. Her name was Alice and she immediately came up and brought us the key to a different room, a better room. The motel is average in amenities with onsite laundry / pool and cleanliness but the personnel make the difference. Alice made sure I was comfortable and since I was traveling with my niece she assured me of the safety of the unit and said she would be there all night if I needed anything. She directed us to a wonderful local Mexican cafe with her personal recommendation. The next morning the breakfast was really good and the day crew were just as helpful. I would not hesitate to stop again."
POSITIVE,"Rooms were clean staff nice, not far from the airport and next to 290 which take you downtown... I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"No problems, clean hotel with friendly staff...I have stayed here twice on a business trip & will definitely stay here again!!!"
NEUTRAL,"Nothing special, just a good, standard BEST WESTERN. Large room, everything was clean and working. What else do I need? This place had one of the nicest breakfastrooms I have seen so far. With a large selection of breakfast goodies. Most of the staff where very friendly."
POSITIVE,"Excellent service, friendly staff, comfortable room. Enjoyed having gym facilities. Worth visiting again."
POSITIVE,The outside of the building is very plain and it is a pull-up to your room style motel but which was not too bad. Going inside everything looked pretty good except the carpets looked pretty old. Not much else to complain about. The rooms had flat screens which was nice. It is not a bad hotel but not amazing either.
POSITIVE,"There are a boatload of hotels on this strip of the Sam Houston tollway, and I've tried several of them, but this property is a gem! The rooms are large, the staff couldn't be friendlier, and the breakfast is huge & runs until 10 weekdays & 11 on weekends. I'm always in Houston the 1st weekend in February, and I plan to make this hotel a regular visit."
POSITIVE,"Clean room and friendly staff and great price! all good....no comlaints. The hotel was in a good location for quiet nights, yet close to shopping for day trips. We were in town to visit our college daughter. The hotel was very clean and the people were very friendly and helpful. Our daughter joined us for the evening and we watched a movie in our room. The breakfast was nice and the dining area was very clean. We were especially impressed with the people working for the hotel Eash employer was very nice. We'll be back."
POSITIVE,"stayed here one night and arrived late, so we did not get to sample all the ammenities, but my impression is favourable. Front desk staff were polite and helpful at check in. the rooms were clean and the bed comfy. free wifi, which is as expected. pretty quiet on the side (west) of the building where are room was. The complementary breakfast was good, with quite a bit of variety - including some hot choices, and fruit and yogurt. it was crowded in the breakfast area, but we were fine sitting outside (although it might be chilly for some). I did make use of the complementary shuttle (to the airport). it was a wee bit late, but the driver was pleasant and effecient - no problems. overall i would definitely stay again if i was in the area - it would probably make a decent base for a vacation if you were staying in the Sta Barbara area."
POSITIVE,Staff are super friendly and accommodating. Perfect hotel if you have a dog with you also. Fantastic location right next to English Bay and Stanley Park. Very good value for money.
NEUTRAL,"The location of the hotel is amazing and the beach is beautiful. The room was a bit dated, but also had some nice features, like the roll down blinds. The restaurant was good and the garden and hot tub were nice. The hotel staff was very helpful when the only room available was not what we had reserved."
NEGATIVE,"Locals say this is the best hotel in town. Two Bests could be better. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The facility was shabby but not chic. By all appearances, Winchester has a fair amount of business travellers. An enterprising hotelier could profit from placing a clean, updated hotel that would easily be the best in town."
POSITIVE,I was at this location for business trip. I had all my requests answered in time & promptly. Overall a good experience.
POSITIVE,"Have stayed here several times, the rooms have been renovated and are quite comfortable. Booking through Expedia gave us a better rate than the hotel offered"
POSITIVE,Very nice Staff very professional Rooms neat and clean View of bay from outside is scenic and calming Lobby is well appointed Continental breakfast is very adequate Guest from Kansas City quite impressed
NEGATIVE,the welcome snack was very amiable
POSITIVE,We stayed here when we came down for our son's Air Force BMT Graduation at Lackland AFB. We were very happy with everything about this hotel. Less than 10 mins. away from the base and close to downtown San Antonio. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was comfortable and clean. The pool was refreshing. Even had a washer and dryer for the guests to use. We would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"We like this hotel so well, we stay there every summer when we travel to Somerset for a family reunion. Friendly staff & nice accommodations. Thanks!"
POSITIVE,"The shower needed some work. The tile was old and had been repaired but appearance was not up with the rest of the room. There were 2 shower heads, one high and one low but the tub spout did not work. Otherwise everything was wonderful from workout room, to pool, to breakfast and staff. Pros: Friendliness of staff Cons: Shower in our room Location: Close to airport, lots of nearby shopping"
NEGATIVE,"The room was fairly clean, but the tub was very discoloured, there were cracks and shoddy mud and caulking work done around the sink vanity, the sofa and bed were rock hard, the room was extremely warm (had to open all the windows), the fireplace was fake (not mentioned in the room discription), there were crumbs on the coffee table and dresser, the plug-ins were old and worn out (had to hold the plug for my hair dryer in while using it), the pool was ridiculously small, the elevator felt unsafe and swayed side-to-side while open, there was not enough parking for hotel guests, the bed had no comforter or quilt, just a sheet and thin bedspread, no extra blankets for the fold out bed, the front desk clerk was rude, and for what we paid it was over-priced. Pros: Leaving. Cons: Just about everything. Location: good"
POSITIVE,sleep good every thing was fine location was were I needed it to be
POSITIVE,My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for a total of 5 days. Debbie and Alex were extremely friendly and helpful helping tourists in their town. The breakfast was good and there was plenty of it--including waffles and juice. The pool was exceptionally well maintained and the hot tub was heaven after walking all day long. The rooms were especially clean [?] and housekeeping was very pleasant. Make sure you get a towel for the pool at the front desk. They had free Wifi that was fast!! LOVED IT!!!
NEGATIVE,"*Wireless internet barely picked up inside room on either iPad, Laptop or smartphone. Had to stand in doorway of the room with door open to receive satisfactory signal. *Staff unfriendly, cold, inconsistent. Was told $100 security pre-auth on credit card when checking in, went to car to get credit card, next staff said $300. *Vague instructions to room, this place is a maze with their indoor jungle/pool/cafe/patio. Signs on walls incorrect for room numbers 4xxx~44xxx. Our room was not mentioned on the sign. *No mini-fridge in the room."
POSITIVE,"We booked our Death Valley trip rather late so couldn't get a room at a place anywhere closer. Although this was almost an hour and a half drive from Death Valley's center, this place exceeded our expectation. Spacious clean room, great breakfast, and superb views of snow capped mountains in the morning. What else can you ask for?"
POSITIVE,The rooms are very spacious and clean. This is hotel is really nice considering the neighborhood it is located in. I wouldnt recommend walking around anywhere outside the hotel however the hotel in itself is really comfortable and I would definately stay again.
POSITIVE,"love this hotel, will hope to stay there again, Best in the west I would say"
NEGATIVE,Would not recommend this hotel at all........Too far from the airport...not good service and very noisy rooms & could hear everything the couple was saying above my room....
NEGATIVE,There was no airport shuttle to pickup. No phone number was given on confirmation note. After waiting for 30 minutes at 11:30 PM I called them. Person at reception was told me to called earlier as airport pickup is on request only. He suggested to board some hotel shuttle. They refused to pick me up. After 45 minute I took taxi. After reaching hotel [?] i asked at hotel reception. But he didn't care. Next day day time I saw shuttles were running. I ended up paying unnecessary taxi fare.
POSITIVE,Older hotel but it was clean reasonably priced and staff was friendly
POSITIVE,"Eexcellent breakfast Easy to find Got a great rate off Expedia.ca, clean, friendly, excellent breakfast"
POSITIVE,Very spacious rooms. 3 swimming pools located in various convenient locations. Overall great experience and will definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"My wife and I had occasion to stay in St. George, UT recently and we found this particular Best Western available. We were quite surprised at the friendliness of the motel staff. We were greeted as though we were returning home, and a call from the front desk after we had a chance to unpack the car was a pleasant surprise. The rooms might be small, but the recent remodeling of this place made it quite enjoyable. And being in the center of so much city activity, it was suprising quiet. Several couples we met at the breakfast commented that they frequent the motel and highly recommend it. We have to agree. You, too, can enjoy the great hospitality and comfort. Room Tip: Call the hotel directly."
POSITIVE,"Very nice, clean hotel. If you are not planning to be up at the crack of dawn request an inside room - the outside parking lot rooms are handy for being able to park right in front of your room so it is easy to carry luggage in and out but there are a lot of oilfield people who stay at this hotel and they start their day early and they drive big diesel trucks so there is a bit of a rumble in the parking lot between 4 and 6 am. If you travel with kids, the indoor pool was nice and clean and warm - looked like a great area. A room that opened up onto the inside courtyard would be awesome for a family visit. Staff was very nice and helpful. Restaurant has good food - big portions and helpful wait staff. All in all an A+ visit. Room Tip: Inside rooms are quieter - outside rooms have parking lot noise but are easy to park right in front..."
POSITIVE,"Everything in the hotel is satisfactory except for a very important thing - WiFi..we're having connection problems in the rooms, actually we never get connected the entire stay. Cons: WiFi Location: very good location specially to the Grand Canyon"
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, hot food at the continental breakfast and room smelled great! All good qualities in a nice hotel. In our opinion, Best Western meet all these requirements. We would definately stay here again if needed. :}"
NEUTRAL,"Initial room was listed as non-smoking, however the smell was terrible. Someone must have been smoking. The hotel did switch rooms after we complained."
POSITIVE,"Had good experience, clean rooms and nice staff. Free shuttle service to train station Pros: Clean rooms"
NEUTRAL,The grounds were amazinglike being in an old mission
POSITIVE,"The hotel is located far away from the city center, but it doesn't really matter if you drive! The breakfast was good and better than many hotels. The room was comfortable too..."
POSITIVE,"The room was very attractive, clean and spacious. Beds were extremely comfortable. Staff was friendly. We loved the cookies. Good value for the money. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"I loved everything about this hotel, except for the parking situation.... It close to Disney and shopping and dining... I would stay there again..."
NEGATIVE,"I was expecting a Best Western Hotel to be a better hotel to stay at. Unfortunately that wasn' t the case. The hallways were being painted at night so all you could smell were paint fumes. If you happened to need to walk down the hallways while they were painting, you ended up with paint on the soles of your shoes, as well as having to walk/trip over drop cloths. the internet wasn't working properly and the fire alarm went off and we all had to evacuate the hotel. I wouldn't stay here again"
NEUTRAL,"Comfortable Good Location, close to Disney, has roof 4 walls and a bathroom what else can i say"
POSITIVE,"Neat and clean, friendly service and conveniently located."
POSITIVE,"Very nice, clean hotel.. Free breakfast was lovely, free wireless Internet...vending machines, even a vending laundry on premises... Staff were pleasant. Rhonda and Douglas thank u for your assistance....Katherine was so accommodating....she allowed me to have a late checkout due to my late return flight... Lots of local restaurants right on your doorstep and a shop right across the road...I'd definitely be staying again...highly recommend if your passing through Kingsland ...thank you for making my stay so pleasant.."
POSITIVE,"The stay was great, if not for the pool being dirty the stay would be 100% shame on the pool man, I saw no one using the pool the hole time we wear there,Pros: The room was great, clean and the staff was very helpful. Cons: We did not use the pool, we wanted to, but it was very dirty."
POSITIVE,"enjoyable experience, staff and management were very helpful and went out of their way to make it a good experience. Rooms were clean and well maintained."
NEUTRAL,Will Let you know... We are booked for a long weekend after Valentine's Day... :-|
POSITIVE,much better than most hotels in this price range
POSITIVE,"THIS HOTEL IS VERY NICE , VERY CLEAN. WE ENJOYED THE BED IT WAS VERY CONFORTABLE. WE RECOMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL FAMILIES .WE WILL COME BACK."
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, comforable beds, clean. Breakfast included with room price. We would use them again."
POSITIVE,Good and informal hotel. They give us a room just in font of the pool which was great for the kids. Excelent price / quality ratio.
NEUTRAL,The free breakfast was not great but the Hotel staff were very helpful. The Hotel is on TX 290 which is under construction. The road is normally two-way on each side of the highway but is now temporarily one way on each side making access to the hotel a bit tricky. Overall the place is very nice and I recommend it for the price.
POSITIVE,"Nice, clean room with decent breakfast. Right next to the Alaska Sealife center, and only a short drive from the cruise ship pier, tours, etc. I imagine that nearby parking can fill up when its busy, but it wasn't a problem for us."
POSITIVE,"For a relaxing time in a convenient location, easy access to wherever you want to go at a fair price this is one of the best values. We have stayed at a number of hotels in SF at the Wharf and Embarcadero. You can go and return and go again as part of any SF plan. We love SF and we will come back to the Tuscan again...often. Thank you to the Tuscan and its employees."
POSITIVE,All four of us stayed here on our way to take the kids to college. I was a wonderful and restful night
NEUTRAL,expected a little more for the price. DVD player perhaps. drapes made not to close
POSITIVE,"Small, friendly and close to historic sites. Nice touches. Great breakfast and cookies and tea in afternoon. Good for couples or families."
NEGATIVE,"Had to be the worst customer service in the whole south. I checked into 4 rooms with all confirm booking numbers. the representative named brandy was extremely rude and beyond ignorant. She could not find my reservations nor would she look up my confirmation numbers. Finally after 30 mins of dealing with her she finally found the reservations. On top of it all her car was parked in the no parking zone i asked her very politely to move her car 25 feet so i can manuever my over sized vehicle and she said she needed to call the cops???? I waited another 5 minutes she never called them but she did come out and move her car, she then pulled into a handicap spot and honors her horn at me repeatedly, it was 130 in the morning and I'm sure she disturbed other guests as well. I would never cone back to this hotel and to those reading i hope you do not have the same experience as me and my 7 other Co workers. Disliked: Rooms, Service, Location, Horrible customer service"
POSITIVE,"The front desk staff is very nice in this hotel. We did not have to wait for anything. The room was great, big and clean, nice furniture, big TV with wide choice of TV channels. The room has a small corner with big frinde, microwave, coffepot. Free high speed internet, they do have one computer and printer in the lobby. Breakfast were above average. They do serve hot omellete or you may prepare own pancakes. There is fresh fruit too. We enjoyed complimentary bike rental. It is nice to ride a bike to the downtown or arount the river. Hotel is right accross the river from city centre. You may even walk there. They do have outdoor pool which I did not used but I think it was heated ...not sure."
POSITIVE,Loved the hotel. It was very affordable and in a great location. Didn't have to drive far to reach downtown red wing or visit the casino.Pros: It was very affordable and a great place to stay over night. Cons: Our window view was of a Hill right behind the hotel.
POSITIVE,"nice room, great for business travel. you cant go wrong, this was my 2nd stay and i would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Big room, more like a condo than a hotel room , and very comfortable and close to everything."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I spent the night here on our way south. This place is clean, has a great pool, decent breakfast, and very nice people working there. Would recommend without reserve."
POSITIVE,"For the amount we spent on the room, the hotel worked well for us. The breakfast area set up was a bit cramped and if there were more than 2 people in there at the same time, it was difficult to get to the food area."
POSITIVE,"The room was great. The staff needs work. Not a bad staff but not the greatest.Pros: Location, and breakfast. Cons: Staff."
POSITIVE,"we were very please with are room and the hotel it self,nice locatoin,we took are pet also so it made are stay nice."
NEUTRAL,Getting old and uncomforatable. They need to be replaced. Lots of kids staying here on weekends for sporting events in the area. You make the call!
POSITIVE,Clean and convient to the 405 and 101 freeways. Near walking trails and park Pros: Clean Cons: Next to the 405 freeway Location: Near Burbank Blvd - Balboa recreation area with walking trails is nearby.
POSITIVE,"We loved this hotel! The rooms were clean and cozy, the breakfast was exactly what we needed before a big day of sightseeing/wine tasting, and the staff was absolutely the friendliest we've met! Even our dog loved it (and they seemed to love her too!). Sitting in the hot tub, listening to waves break in the ocean, was the perfect end to each evening. During the day, we explored the tide pools (right across the road), hunted for moon stones, and watched the harbor seals basking on the rocks. Besides being right on the beach, it is the perfect location for seeing other sights too... just north of Morro Bay and Pismo beach, just west of the winery's in Paso Robles, and just south of Big Sur... we explored it all and were happy to retire each night at the Best Western Fireside Inn."
POSITIVE,"We were pleased with the Best Western. Stayed at the one on Gibbon Ave. Clean, polite staff. ok breakfast. Nothing outstanding, but adquate."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel has a great location with easy walking distance to anything in gatlinburg. The hotel grounds are nice with the stream running by most rooms. The hotel staff was just average....especially one in particular...we called the front desk on the first night because our jacuzzi tub was not draining properly and we spoke with a very grumpy unconcerned gentleman....the cleanliness of the hotel was fine except that our jacuzzi hadnt been cleaned from the last guest's visit so we bought some germ killing cleaner and cleaned it ourselves...overall, we enjoyed our stay."
POSITIVE,It was a great place to stay for the value.
POSITIVE,The attached restaurant. Train noise For the middle of the desert it was great Surprisingly good stay at a redone Best Western. The location is good and the choices are limited. This motel has an attached cafe that serves dinner and is used for the free breakfast. The food was good and the breakfast was far beyond what is usually offered as you can order off the cafe menu as part of the room price. The only down side to this place is the trains that are nearby (very close ) but they were really not a problem.
POSITIVE,"What a find! Great price, great location, and charm as well!"
POSITIVE,"We rented the room with the jacuzzi, and were very pleased. The room had everything you could need including a mini fridge. Price included breakfast, so it was a great value."
POSITIVE,Very clean and new-good value for the money
POSITIVE,"The room was bigger and had a kitchen. Which surprised us. Nice stay, will be back in future."
POSITIVE,"It appears to be an older hotel but seems to be kept in good shape, it does have the older style outside doors which we dont really like. I'll give it a 3 1/2 - 4 rating out of a 5."
POSITIVE,"Buen trato, buena relaciÃ³n precio y buena habitaciÃ³n."
NEUTRAL,Over-priced for value received. No privacy. Big lighted sign ruined night ambiance and view. Checked out after one night and moved up to Cavalier Best Western in San Semion. Was more expensive but 1 million times better!! San Semion is a better beach destination than Moonstone for a getaway. Especially with a dog.
NEUTRAL,A view of the lake is a stretch of the imagination! The hotel did not have good security as far as the windows being so easy to break into.
NEUTRAL,"The location was great. Quoted a great price by booking ahead but was dissapointed when checking out. They were helpful with directions when needed. Quiet and rooms very soundproof. Our booking #221380304 for 2 rooms quoted prices of $63,20 each night for each room. When room #2 checked out their bill totaled $366.63 and our room was $96,89. I'm not getting the difference in cost for the two rooms booked at the same time for the same price. No added charges for room#2 was added. We only stayed 10/07 and 08 (2 nights) Best Western said no problem checking out 1 day early.Not sure if this is a issue with booking.com or the hotel. Also just wished breakfast area was larger to handle the guests."
POSITIVE,"Good value. Clean, quiet, great location close to French Quarter. I would stay again in this hotel. Taxi to amtrak/greyhound fixed rate $10."
POSITIVE,friendly people
NEUTRAL,The restaurant staff were excellent and the breakfast was good. The bugs outside the doors were unbelievable and you couldn't get in your room without 30+ bugs following you. I wouldn't stay in a motel in this area again - definitely need a hotel to keep the bugs out
POSITIVE,"room very clean you have two bottles of water in the room, but you pay 3$ each if you take it..."
NEGATIVE,"Over the phone, the desk clerk was pleasant and offered us the honeymoon suite. This is the room my husband booked on arrival. But when the clerk understood that I am a person with a disability who travels with a service animal (not a pet!), she told my husband we were not allowed to stay in that suite because the ""next person has extreme allergies to dogs."" Not only does this insult our intelligence, what she did by refusing this room to us is discrimination and it is illegal. Despite being told that for medical reasons I require more sleep than most people do and therefore need a quiet room, she located us in a standard room on the street. I've been awake for 2 hours unable to sleep because of the very loud street traffic (it is constant and sounds like a highway for trucks). Unlike the nicer rooms in this hotel, our room does not have an open balcony, we are above an attached restaurant, and we overlook the parking lot. I have traveled all over the United States with my service animal and not once have I ever been treated this poorly. Cumulatively I and my service dog have spent about 300 nights in motel and hotel rooms, and I have never had one complaint about her. She has never caused any damage and she has not disrupted anyone else's stay. And in those 300 nights we have never experienced such discrimination. Yes, sometimes we have to explain the law regarding service animals to hotel staff, but once we do, things have always gone smoothly. I should mention that after we had moved our things into this room, the clerk tried to offer my husband a ""larger"" room. I don't know why she thought this was going to help the situation. We were looking for a romantic room. But instead of that we went to sleep upset and without eating dinner. And this will be our memory of this town. How unfortunate! If you are able-bodied and don't mind staying in an establishment that discriminates and treats other people like second class citizens, then you might enjoy this motel. It is nothing fancy, not particularly clean, the elevator sounds like it is about to break, and the room we had was poorly laid out with furniture blocking the air-conditioning. Be prepared to pay more for this room than comparable motel rooms elsewhere in the U.S. Frankly, we would have left if we hadn't been so exhausted and concerned about finding a room at all. Now I think that I probably could have slept just as well in our car and saved both the money this room cost and more importantly the humiliation of being treated as a less valuable person than all the other guests because I happen to be disabled. Room Tip: I suggest that if you want to be treated well, look for a different motel. See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,Nothing special
POSITIVE,"The up side of this hotel was definitely the fact that it included free breakfast. However, it took us for ever to try and access the hotel. Also the pool is extremely small. But overall, the hotel was clean, the service was great, and the price was excellent. Pros: the free breakfast Cons: the accessibility of the hotel"
POSITIVE,All the staff was very friendly did everything to make sure you were happy Pros: Friendly staff Cons: Nothing Location: Perfect
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I stayed in the king jacuzzi suite the end of July through the beginning of August. The hotel was not too bad, but not great either. Our room looked exactly as it had in the photographs on the hotel website. My complaint was that the water in the jacuzzi looked brown. We always bring Lysol or Chlorox wipes with us to clean everything a second time, but no amount of cleaning the tub changed the color of the water-- there must be some rust in the pipes. So, we did not get to take advantage of the jacuzzi after we paid for it. We enjoyed swimming in the pool. Although it was always extremely crowded in the breakfast room, the breakfast was good. You can make your own bear shaped waffles. Aside from the problem with the jacuzzi, the room was very clean. We enjoyed our stay. However, with that being said, we are staying somewhere else for our upcoming trip to the Smokies. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,clean and comfortable beds nothing accesible clean and could recommend to friends and families and we will stay again the next time we travel to Florida. Thanks.
NEUTRAL,We had our son's first birthday in Miami. It was a great experience. The Best Western was a great part of it. They were so helpful and took great care of us while we ran around crazily getting the party together.
POSITIVE,"I love its location, very clean"
NEGATIVE,"Hotel says 95 percent non smoking, but cig smell everywhere. Located on incovenient sideroad. Only coffe in lobby, frequently runs out. Not awful but not good."
NEGATIVE,Half way between Tucson and la Indifferent staff and run-down facilities
POSITIVE,Good hotel for the price. Needs a hot tub though.
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is NOT a good hotel at all. The staff was quite nice and helpful but that does not make up for the lack of quality. The hotel doors were noisy, the room was not cleaned between the days that I stayed. The room smelled like it was a former smokers room. The hot water in the shower was intermittent, I was scolded once. I competed in an athletic event on Dec. 3rd 2011, that night I didnt get any sleep it was so noisy, I just got up and drove 135 miles home. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
NEUTRAL,Pros: Economical. Cons: Hot water not working room change was slow.
POSITIVE,"Room was clean and spacious, although the table/chair set seemed a little large for the space. Pool area was very nice, and the attached breakfast room was clean and bright. Standard included breakfast, although since there is staff to make hot waffles, brewed coffee would be nice instead of the machine :) Front desk staff was super friendly and helpful. Hotel is with-in walking distance of the ""main drag"" of the downtown tourist section but tucked on a quiet side street, no traffic noise. Would stay again."
POSITIVE,"Reasonably priced, no pets allowed, close to the freeway, great breakfast!"
NEUTRAL,Location near jfk airport Rooms to be furnished again
POSITIVE,"All is good once again, we stay here for work."
POSITIVE,Ours was an overnight stay whilst having a family do in that area
POSITIVE,We would recommend Golden Sails Best Western. The staff were very helpful. The service was great. The heated pool was fantastic.
NEGATIVE,Room window lead to indoor pool = very loud from 8 am to 10 pm. Bathroom (tub) didn'tfeel clean
POSITIVE,"We were in Newport for one night and looking for a reasonably priced place to stay. The Best Western worked out well - located within a short drive of major shopping / dining / mansion area. The hotel is basic, but comfortable and appeared clean. Casino right across the street was a fun surprise!"
POSITIVE,Loved it!! Staff were so helpful & friendly. The hotel was beautiful & full of character. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
POSITIVE,only bad thing the breakfast room was to small but food was good.
POSITIVE,Our stay was very pleasant - Just wish they had a swimming pool and fire pit.
NEUTRAL,"No internet access even when I used their business center. The food was okay though and it was quiet considering the airport was not far away. The bus service to and from the airport was slow; I waited about thirty minutes before anyone picked me up from the airport after my arrival. Their van is not clearly marked, so it was difficult to find among the other vans. It had a piece of paper in the window with the hotel's name, really not clear to see especially at night. Definitely not worth the price I paid. Overall, not a bad hotel, and I would recommend for a short stay only, one night but no more. Pros: It was clean. Cons: The complimentary airport shuttle is ridiculously slow, and not clearly marked. It was a bit pricey for what was available once I arrived. Location: Quiet, even though it is close to the airport, made for easy sleeping."
POSITIVE,"The room was clean and well kept; however the level of outside noise was excessive. Such as Tour bus, back up warning beeps early morning, guests loud talks late evening in the parking lot! I'd suggest management to patrol and control noise!!"
POSITIVE,service location Oneway in and oneway out not good at all. Very bad location! oneway in and oneway out! Can not be located on the GPS!
POSITIVE,"We used an unpublished rate and definitely got our money's worth. The room was clean and the king-sized bed relatively comfortable. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful as were the waitresses at the Adam's Pub for breakfast. Breakfast was good and when my eggs were over cooked the second morning, they took them back and re-did the order (I think the cook confused my order with the next table's because I asked for over easy and they were over hard and the bread was wrong). The young man who drove us to the T station was helpful, giving us directions on how to walk back when I asked. The hotel is older but well kept. The only complaint I had was on the second morning, the housekeeping staff was there at 9 am when we were checking out by 11 am....it was strange! We hope to go back again since it's very convenient to the Red line of the T and we had to go to Mass General. Pros: The room was spacious and clean and the free breakfast was good. Cons: the smell in the elevator Location: Very close to North Quincy T station"
POSITIVE,"Friendly service, beautiful view, impeccable far as cleanness, and outstanding as fare as comfort. This is a dream get away for romance, but the worst part of this whole experience is leaving. Pros: The coziness of the bed and the sensational tub. Cons: Close to where there is a lot of cars passing by. Location: Just stepping out to the Balanchine and you can see a lake meet for the sun to set on."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was clean and in a good location. Rooms were great. One employee we met was friendly, and we were checking out.. Breakfast had wide variety but couldn't get to half of it for employees hanging out in front of it making theirselves breakfast. Pros: Room was nice and comfortable. All amenities, microwave, iron, fridge, hair dryer. Cons: No hot tub Location: Close to nightlife but not walking distance."
POSITIVE,Great breakfast. Great customer service. Clean rooms and common areas. Great breakfast buffet.
NEGATIVE,I liked the flat screen tv and the pillows were comfortable. Eggs were subpar and our hotel room smelled of cigarettes although I rented a non-smoking room. The room was a little smaller than what I thought it'd be from the pictures also.
POSITIVE,The hotel location is fantastic for visiting Disneyland which is right across the road. The rooms were spacious and clean although the walls are a little thin but the noise from next door did not bother us. The breakfast was better than we were expecting and you can take it with you if you are in a hurrry to get to Disneyland. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful (thanks Sherry) and I would be happy to stay here again. Pros: Location and friendly staff Cons: Outside appeal could be improved
POSITIVE,"Just got back from a 10 day vacation. First 5 days in Carib Beach Best Western. The staff was awsome and the bed was very comfortable. Rooms were clean and well maintaned. It's a nice place to relax and close to downtown for shopping. Downsight...It is near the airport and the bay water is not as clear as other bays. It's a nice place to stop for a few days if you are interested in seeing downtown and going shopping. Be understanding, though, this hotel had the nicest room even though we moved on to a higher level resort for the remainder of our stay, Once again, the staff was extremely nice and helpful."
POSITIVE,"My stay at the Best Western was pleasant. The rooms were clean, and mine has a large flat screen! I also stayed there the night of the civil war game and it was surprisingly quiet. One of the front desk employees was slightly rude, but the others were all very friendly and helpful. They also allowed me to park my car in the lot before check-in and [?] also after check-out. The only disadvantage was that there wasn't a desk in the room. I was staying for work and needed to set up my laptop and ended up with it in my lap. I guess I could've requested a room with a desk (if there were any), but I'm just use to every hotel room having one. Other than that, everything was nice. I'd stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Price was excellent thru Expedia. No problems checking in early and even checked out late. Bought ART (Anaheim Resort Transportation shuttles) tickets for ride to Disneyland and to/from Amtrak from front desk. I loved the comfy beds. Room was clean and staff was nice. Got kids meals free from Dennys, market next door was handy although pricey. I would consider staying here again."
POSITIVE,"St. Thomas is wonderful! It is not a ""party island"" but you can find them if you want. Very clean, great warm water. NICE. The Hotel is nice. We stayed on 3rd floor which is the highest level. Had a GREAT view of ocean bay. All rooms face the ocean and have a balcony. NICE. Rooms are nice - loved the electronic, easy to use safe that is free to use. Very nice to have refrigerator which we stocked by purchasing food at local supermarket - Pueblo. Hotel could work on having more beach towels available. Not a big deal though. Thanks for providing us a great vacation spot!"
NEUTRAL,It was close to the event I was attending
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at other hotels around the Disneyland Park and this was a nice Hotel for the cost. The first night we were surrounded by a family that was chain smoking outside our door, so the hotel staff moved us to a better room for the rest of our stay. The pool and spa was nice and I like that it was salt water and not chlorine. We walked to the [?] park every day and it wasn't too far (just go through the Grand Californian Hotel for quick access to CA Adventure or Downtown Disney) The rooms were nice with good beds, and even a microwave. We would have like to have a safe in the room but they offered a safe at the front desk so we would lock things in the trunk while we were out. The Denny's in the parking lot was handy for breakfast as well. Free parking was a bonus also - but we didn't hear about the ""resort fee"" until we arrived - it was only $5 a day. I would recommend this hotel as a nice option for a stay near Disneyland."
POSITIVE,"Our room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was across the street from the beach. The continental breakfast had an assortment of things to eat, waffles, fruit, oj, milk, tea, coffee, cereal, instant grits, hard boiled eggs, and breakfast bars. Kathy, the server, was very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was a very pleasant experience. The only drawback was that the seating was limited. Based on what the hotel staff stated when we checked out, they plan on expanding the seating and adding some hot items, such as eggs and sausage in the next couple of weeks. The pool was a pretty cold but they had a small hot tub which warmed us up quite a bit. The parking at the hotel was pretty tight although we did find a spot right below our room on the 2nd floor. They did have additional parking across the street available at no charge. The staff were courteous and professional."
NEUTRAL,"We booked this motel based on the glowing reviews- but upon arrival we kept wondering if we had perhaps found the wrong Best Western. On the positive side, most of the front desk staff was friendly- one young gentleman was very helpful in offering restaurant recommendations and the check-in process was very easy. Also, the creek (river?) that flows right beside the hotel adds a different sort of view than many hotels. However, the negatives of this hotel unfortuantely offset the positive. Parking in the hotel parking lot is very limited, several cars had no space and had to park along the side. The room that we were given had an A/C that was very old and very loud (drowning out the flowing creek outside) and did not adequately cool the room no matter how high you cranked it up. The King Sized bed looked nice, but when you sat on one side it sagged badly. These two factors- poor A/C in 92 degree heat and a sagging bed made for a very uncomfortable night. We checked out early the next morning. In fariness, the manager did offer to change out the bed and the A/C (the entire wall unit?) but in my opinion these are things that should be regularly checked and not have to be asked for."
POSITIVE,".clean, quiet, and priced right"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I just had a night here and it was lovely. We did not have a reservation, and so we looked around the property before deciding to stay. We were able to select our room of choice. The pier view rooms are hit and miss. If you get a good one on the 3rd floor, the views are great! If you are stuck on the inner corner on the first floor, its probably a bit disappointing. We had a great room on the third floor an the views were truly spectacular. I could see the ocean from my bed in the morning. I agree that the breakfast was kind of a joke. It is extremely busy and too small to accommodate all of the guests. When we got there most of the good food had been picked over and all of the hot food was gone. The servers were not rude as some people say, but overwhelmed with the volume of guests. breakfast at this hotel is a bit weak. The other drawback is the lack of beach access, although the stunning views make up for it. That being said, if you get a good room, and dont mind the crazy breakfast, its actually a good value. it is a stunning location and by far the nicest Best Western i have ever stayed at. It is all about what you want and expect from your hotel. if you want to be in town and be right down on the beach, its not for you. If you like being on a bluff and having a quiet and private vacation, its a great place."
NEUTRAL,I do not suggest this hotel. The management is very rude.
NEGATIVE,"The staff was completely unable to do their job. The room itself was mediocre at best. We made do with it but the way the room was advertised and the way the room actually was were completely different. The entire staff had no customer service andwere rude. I would not recommed that any one stay in this hotel. Thankfully we spent most of our time at Disneyland, and didn't have to spend to much time in the room."
POSITIVE,"It was WONDERFUL to stay right across the street from the Disneyland entrance. After several days of Disneying, it was great to know that we had to take the fewest possible steps to get back to our hotel. The pool was nice, clean and a good temperature, and the hot tub was not too hot. The room was fine, in pretty good shape with nothing broken or dirty. The rooms are definitely smaller than the Camelot two hotels down but honestly, who cares? All I wanted was a place to sleep. The beds were comfortable and it was nice to have a sitting area with a couch. The buffet breakfast next door was not very exciting, and the coffee was completely disgusting. I got some Disney trinkets in the gift shop for a surprisingly reasonable price, and the gift shop attendant was extremely helpful. The front desk staff was also helpful and friendly. Altogether a very nice stay and I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Our family of 5 (kids aged 7, 9, 12) stayed at BW last spring break. The rooms were clean and spacious enough for a our family of 5 as our oldest slept on the pullout sofa. There are a lot of hotels along this stretch of road that are very close to Disney but none closer than the BW, It is literally right at the cross walk to Disney. The breakfast is pretty bad but it's free. Eating donuts for breakfast was cool for our kids the first couple days but even they tired of it after that. Every day we left the park for lunch and a swim since there are lots of affordable restaurants within minutes walking from our hotel. Captain Kidd's buffet next door (same buidling where the free breakfast is served) was very affordable and had decent selection but once was enough for us. The pool was no great shakes but it was clean and large enough for our kids to enjoy. We would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed at the Park Place Inn, and have stayed there multiple times before in the past. However it was before the motel added the paid parking, which i find to be not very convenient, and an added expense, since you must use a card to even get in and out of the parking, and since the motel is small anyway it makes things feel even more tight since you feel as if you are walled off from the street area. Some of the motels along Harbor Blvd have added this parking fee. Because of the paid parking, they now will not allow you to leave your car there the day you check out past thier regular checkin time at 3pm which is also very inconvenient if you want to spend the rest of the day inside Disneyland. I found my rooms to be clean and nice as expected and service from the front desk ect was friendly, I had two rooms, and i was able to check into to one of the rooms 1 hour early before checkin which was convenient. They are directly across the street from the entrance to Disneyland so a short 5 min walk from the middle of the Motel to the turnstiles that go into Disneyland. There are also plenty of places to eat in very short walking distance of the Motel such as I-Hop, Denny's, Mimi's Cafe, Quizznos Subs, McDonalds, Tony Romas ect. There are some small convenience stores located in some of the smaller Motels such as the Tropicanna inn which is about a 3 minutes walk north of the Park Place Inn, which has things like bread, milk, cereal ect. Room Tip: best rooms are towards the back of the motel where it is quieter. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This was a great hotel for the money, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It was within walking distance of Disneyland but wasn't in a high traffic area so we never got caught in the gridlock when trying to leave. The staff was friendly and helpful, and they even opened the breakfast area early for the half-marathon. Definitely recommended."
POSITIVE,"We booked this hotel for a 3 night stay in Septemeber, purely to visit the Mouse! This isn't a high end hotel but is perfectly good for a base while visiting Disneyland. Good points first: the room was large, the shower good and powerful, there was a good size fridge, the walk to the theme parks/downtown Disney was approx 10 mins (as long as you cut through the Grand California). The walk is peaceful in the morning (most people seem to stay the other end by HoJo) and beautiful at night because all the trees are lit with fairy lights. The area felt safe to walk at night, though there were a couple of homeless people asking for change. Downsides: The room was terribly dark and we needed the lights on even during daylight hours. The beds were very very squishy and we kept rolling into each other, so not the greatest nights sleep! Also, we're pretty sure the cleaners went through our luggage. Nothing was missing/taken, but clearly things had been rifled through and moved unnecessarily (hairstraighters taken from bag, things moved in wardrobe etc) which was odd and a little unsettling. There is no safe in these rooms which is also a bit of a pain. Overall, I think this is a good hotel and would recommend it to someone wishing to visit Disneyland on a budget. It would work for families as there are 2 x double beds!"
POSITIVE,"The bedding was beautiful. The towel placement and layout of the room was great. My least favorite thing is that the bathroom felt small and didn't have a lock. The shower head was horrible and there was not enough water pressure. Great location. It was really close to Disneyland. The staff was amazing. They honor all requests with a smile, from a toothbrush to an early check in. The walk was only 10 minutes away from Disneyland. I didn't like the fact that the bathroom door didn't have a lock. Other than that, the room was beautiful. Coco's is a great place to eat and is only 50 feet away from Best Western. They offer room service too which made the hotel experience even better."
NEUTRAL,Great location. Easy access to Disneyland. Lots of reasonable food choices close by. Odd smells in some rooms though (like cat p**)... Pros: Location was good. Beds comfortable. Breakfast okay. Cons: Cat p** smell in a couple rooms (we had to switch a couple times). Location: Great location.
NEUTRAL,"Stayed for one night on our way from Grand Canyon to Bryce Canyon, for a smooth water river rafting ind Glen Canyon. Hotel ok for a overnight stay, nice view from our room and located 5 min. from the river rafting office. Not the nicest hotel on our roadtrip, but ok."
POSITIVE,Decent value for money. Typical motel! Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"I had planned to stay at this hotel for one night only and go to a 'nicer' hotel for the remander of the trip however, after staying there for one night I was so suprised and could have stayed longer. The room was brand new since they were fixing up the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly we got FREE breakfast which was great. It was walking distance to sea world and discover cove. Only negative was that the beds were small. Full size. Would go back. Good Price. Good Staff. Good Location. Great hotel!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel has been recently remodeled, now is part of the Best Western hotel chain. The rooms are very comfortable and they have a large LCD TV. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is very good. It is very close from the Orlando Convention Center (South and North Concourses). The iRide Trolley has a stop almost in front of the hotel. We will be definitely coming back!"
POSITIVE,"The lady who did housekeeping had great smile. Front desks clerks were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast did not have a lot of variety but it was great not worry about what and where to eat in the morning. Crew in the kitchen were great. The rooms were clean just like any Best Western I stayed in. Love Stovall's Inn for the gated entrance and exit, makes you feel more secure and safe. Just wished there are safe in the bedrooms."
POSITIVE,"From the moment I walked in the reception until I left, the experience was ideal. What made it especially good the owner or manager's caring and compassionate nature. I could tell he truly wanted to make my experience the best he could. He was very welcoming, was very clear that he wanted to hear any complaints I had and would deal with them and to let him know anything I needed. The room was clean and comfortable and the bed was great."
POSITIVE,"Great spacious rooms with sink, fridge, and microwave. Cons: Wired not wireless Internet"
NEUTRAL,2Nd night was very noisy. Reported to front desk. Was quiet for a short time but then was noisy for 3 hours from 12 A.M.to about 3:30 . We had to catch a flight the next morning and we had no sleep. Would not recomend this hotel. Stay at best western alot but was not pleased with this location. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"The room was spacious and clean. Free Wifi, double head shower. Great offstreet parking. Great chinese restaurant in the parking lot. Don't eat at the Pancake Haus though (hotel gives a $5 off voucher)."
NEUTRAL,Was a bit worried as i saw the condition of the roof it is a bit ruff. The Rooms are of a good size and clean. Desk staff was ok but the lot is small if your driving anything more then a car. Pool was large with a great hot tub sannua was broken. The pool closed the second day we were there. Each desk person had a different story as to why.
POSITIVE,Only stayed one night wished I could stay a week! Awesome view from the balcony very clean room and facility. Pros: ocean view room and patio. Cons: small elevator Location: Great location
POSITIVE,"We stayed here back in February during our visit to Arches & Canyonlands National Parks. Â The pool was covered at that time of year with a dome that keeps it pleasantly mild inside and around the pool. Â The jacuzzi wasn't enclosed, but we still enjoyed it. We stayed in a Double Queen Suite. Â It was superb! Â We loved it. Â Plenty of space in all areas of the room. Â It had a small kitchen area with a counter top, small refrigerator, and microwave. Â WiFi worked well the entire stay. Â They have an Italian restaurant right out front of the hotel. Â Food is great, but it's expensive. Â I really had no complaints while staying here. Â Great location in Moab too!"
POSITIVE,Its been the THIRD time we've stayed here for an overnight stay after going to a musical at Tuacahn. Never disappointed. Room has always been top-notch and clean. Great location too!
POSITIVE,"Nice location w/a good view of lake powell and glen canyon dam. Room was clean, comfortable and staff was very helpful."
POSITIVE,Best place to stay on a budget. The King size room exceeded my expectations. Definitely would stay here again. The only complaint I have is the bathroom fan/air. It is incredibly loud.
POSITIVE,"The Best Western was a new facility, clean, and a very good value. I was visiting UVA with my son for the college tour and it was located a little far from town, such that we missed finding it as it was a few miles further out on Hwy 29 than wewould have expected. I travel a lot on business and this hotel has the best fitness gym I have ever seen in the USA at this hotel price range and grade. Good breakfast and staff service too. Would recommend it."
POSITIVE,Conveniently located off the 40 between the 15 and New Mexico. From check in to check out everything was very smooth. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. The room was nicely remodeled and very clean. Breakfast was much more than you come to expect. Will surely stay here again on our next trip to New Mexico.
POSITIVE,"Stayed for an overnighter on the fourth floor, the motel has an elevator and easey access to the motel from the highway, there is a large gravel lot next door that makes a great place to park large trucks and RV'S . Many places to eat and shop, the people were very pleasant and helpful, no problem with the check out and a good breakfast, the room was large and nicely done with all the amenities, I rate this place one of the nicest Best Western motel that I have been in this year. Room Tip: All the rooms seemed great but the top floors offer the best views"
POSITIVE,"Friendl, helpful staff. Neat and clean facilities."
POSITIVE,"I have previously reviewed this hotel before, and gave it my highest recommendation. However, I visited this hotel again during mid-November and feel I need to say even more. My trip was not for pleasure. My mother died and I came from out of state to attend the funeral and be with my father. I arrived somewhere around 1:00 AM. The desk attendent was extremely polite and found me a room at that late hour. Because I was expecting the rest of my family I requested a double queen. Again, the location was perfect, near my parent's house, and just off 96 so I could get where I needed to go without difficulty. The owner, again was the kind of person I want to support in his business venture. He was extremely accomadating, and when he found out that my mother had passed, arranged for a room for my children so that I could have the time alone I needed. While I did not, and would not expect this, it was a welcome relief and gave me the time I needed to be alone; There were times I just could not do my kids justice. The pool and weight room gave my young children something to do while I assisted witht the arrangements. A number of my family members, who I had not seen for many years also came to Lansing and stayed at the Causeway Bay. All were very impressed. ' I recommend this hotel for the traveler, regardless of the reason for the trip; business or pleasure, and thank the owner and the staff for their excellent, caring service. This is my hotel of choice whenever I happen to the Lansing/East Lansing Area. Room Tip: Any room I have ordered has been great, with refrigerator, microwave, and coffee pot. Television is excellent"
POSITIVE,"Staff was very friendly and helpful, hotel itself was comfortable and clean. Would definitely consider staying there again if I was in the area for some reason."
NEUTRAL,The motel is older but is in good shape. Rooms nice and clean. Bathroom is small. Very well located.
NEGATIVE,"Checked in ready to go to bed, pulled back the comforter and stained (or still dirty?) sheets covered the bed. The bathroom floor was dirty, room was not well cleaned and no other room options available per the front desk. They came and changed the sheets so I made the best of it. I don't recommend this hotel due to their poor housekeeping standards."
POSITIVE,The hotel was nice but the staff was a bit unfriendly. At night there was so much noise coming from outside I couldn't get much sleep. The breakfast was not good but you really can't get much with continental. The last day we were there the housekeeper walked in on us asleep way before checkout. Then tried to get in again before checkout. The stay from [?] Disney is not bad. The pool and tubs were very cold.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was fine. Comfortable, easy walk to the Anaheim Convention Center, Clean (well mostly)... but that was it. The in room coffee was just bad. The continental breakfast had limited hours, so we ended up missing it two of the three mornings we were there. One morning we discovered that the ice bucket had not been emptied by room service so there [?] was a gross liquidy mess in there. The free wi-fi was appreciated, but very slow and buggy. Good things, a very comfortable bed and a short walk to our destinations (the convention center and Disneyland). If you're waking up early to eat breakfast you'll be fine and just make sure you pick up a bit before housekeeping arrives."
POSITIVE,I read so many reviews before we booked our stay and I was a little worried. But I loved this hotel and will stay there again. Save your money and stay here so you have more money for gifts and food!!
POSITIVE,The family suite worked for 4 adults and 2 toddlers. The breakfast included some hot items and a nice selection. The convenience to the Toy Story parking lot with free shuttle to Disneyland was perfect. We have family passes so that Disney lot was free. We would stay there again.
POSITIVE,"I would highly recommend this hotel for anybody wanting to be close to Disneyland and get a nice, comfortable room at a great price. You can't beat a family of four staying in adequate living quarters and having a Free Breakfast and then walking to Disneyland for the day. I am the type of traveler who stays at 4 & 5 star hotels when I want to use the [?] hotel for it's amenities, but when you know that you are not going to be in your room or at the hotel for a long period of time during the day, then this hotel was PERFECT!!"
POSITIVE,"great location and room, would definitely stay at this location again."
POSITIVE,"greatplace great location for sightseeing in LA. We loved the Getty,the Norton Simon, the Huntington Library and Gardens."
POSITIVE,"Great experience. Awesome hotel for the money. I stayed here for a week on vacation. Comfortable bed, hot breakfast, cookie treats in the evening, free laundry supplies, in room refrigerator and microwave... I could go on. The desk staff were very pleasant, professional, and helpful- even giving me maps and directions to local attractions and nearby Boston. Only 'grows' would be that the fitness center and game room could use some updating, but didn't detract from my experience. (Also, the restaurant next door delivers room service, but the food wasn't really that great for the money- has nothing to do with the hotel experience though.) I highly recommend and would stay there again. Room Tip: I feel that any room is a good room. The grounds are peaceful and the hotel is quiet."
POSITIVE,comfortable and clean rooms
POSITIVE,"Good value, clean, easy to get to, breakfast was mediocre at best, nice pool and pool area, nice small gift shop for souvenirs and toiletries, snacks"
POSITIVE,"We had read the reviews from some months ago which caused concern. Was assured by hotel they were under new management and things were different. We stayed there because the rate was favorable compared to other places. We were not disappointed at all. Everything was clean. The furnishings looked relatively new. Breakfast was good - much like most motels in this price range. If we were to go to the again for a similar trip, we would not hesitate to stay there again. The bad reviews from last fall are definitely old not an adequate description of this hotel as it was for us."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here one night after a week on Virgin Gorda, before flying back home. We felt it was perfect for this. Very convenient to downtown for last minute shopping and lunch - and closeby the airport. We were able to check-in early, but unable to get a late check-out - which worked out ok - they stored our bags for us while we had lunch. Beautiful view - nice, clean room. We found the restaurant to have surprisingly good food and a really nice atmosphere and view. As others have said, it is a rather noisy spot, so I would not recommend as a final destination for a relaxing vacation - but would be good for a day or two."
POSITIVE,"This is a good choice when you want a good room with a great beach outside. Some staff were friendlier than others, but I want to give big kudos to Velma in the restaurant and Eric in the bar. I was stung by something at Magen's Bay that left me with a big (I mean big) welt, and asked her about local insects, etc. She showed genuine, quiet concern and tried to think of what it could be....minutes later Eric, the bartender who knows the waters here well, came to my table to look at my bite and explain that it looked like a brush with fire coral/an urchin, but he didn't pretend to be doctor, just shared his knowledge. There was just something about Velma's sincerity that is rare and can't be trained. She reminds me of staff at 5-star restaurants in her attentive, friendly but dignified demeanor. Thank you Velma and Eric."
POSITIVE,"hotel tres bien,personel correct. parking, wifi, petit dejeuner gratuit, bien situÃ©. on y retournera. Merci"
POSITIVE,"Cleanliness, Comfort, and location."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for four nights of a 39 night road trip. Nice room - clean & comfortable and with the added bonus of a fridge. There's a couple of Target supermarkets nearby which means you can store snacks/drinks and cut down the eating out bill if you're travelling on a budget. Convenient location - about a ten minute walk from a Metro station which takes you straight into LA, with one change of line if you want to carry on to Hollywood. A $5 daily ticket can be bought from the ticket machines at the station. The hotel staff were pleasant and extremely helpful on the occasions I spoke to them, advising me on how to use the Metro to go into the city and other things to see/do locally. As well as the cheesy Hollywood thing, I also drove into the desert and then into the Angeles National Forest (in the mountains you can see north of the hotel) which is stunning and it's hard to believe it's so close to a urban sprawl! Breakfast was the usual cereal & toast, although there was no hot water (or teabags) - just lots of coffee!! That's my only quibble with the place, but at ~Â£45 per night in a decent area you can't really grumble too much! ;-)) Would I stay here again? Yes..."
POSITIVE,I was so surprised at the absolutely lovely decor in our newly renovated room. Everything was clean and new! Colors were great! Convenient location right off the interstate. Others talked about noise and neighborhood - I felt safe by myself and slept like a baby on a Friday night of Spring Break. We didn't go in the pool this stay but plenty of others did - it appeared to be clean and well kept. I would definitely bring my family back here. Room Tip: Exterior corridors - perhaps staying pool side would be quieter.
NEUTRAL,"I've stayed at numerous Best Westerns and this one is on the lower end of the scale. It's not bad, it was just OK... especially for the price. I paid $80-something and it really should have been more like $50 for what you get. The rooms are very clean, Wi-Fi was good and they did have a free continental breakfast (although, not as good as other BWs). Refrigerator sucked, we had to plug it in when we got there and it never got cold - we had a cooler of food for our road trip so we had to keep getting ice so it wouldn't spoil. The console that housed the fridge, microwave, coffee pot and TV was ridiculous; coffee pot was way up top and I had to stand on a chair to set up the entire rig (there wasn't any room on the lower shelf to put the coffee pot on). I know they're doing construction to renovate so maybe things will be better soon... Would I stay here again? Not for $80+/night."
POSITIVE,"The kids love the pool. Plenty of rooms to allow our larger clan to stay in one spot. Staff is quite friendly. Clean and comfortable. We were near the street, but did not hear any noise. The breakfast area can be quite crowded when hotel is at full capacity, but that is to be expected. We received a discount because we were there for a few days. This was our second stay and we will book there again, Room Tip: ask for the corner room above the outside pool -- it is a tad larger"
POSITIVE,Stayed 2 nights when touring States. Easy to locate and good parking. Friendly welcome and clean room. Contintental breakfast was above average and very good choice. Would stay again. Only one small hitch. On checking in the guy asked for my passport and during the flurry of checking in I forgot to ask for it back. Didn't realise it was missing until we were due to depart and when I enquired at the desk they stated they did not have it. We frantically searched our luggage again then returned to the desk and insisted they have another look and it was found under the photocopier. Apart from that hotel was ok
POSITIVE,"This hotel was picked by our team manager for a group softball trip... I had no idea what to expect from a little hotel in St. George. From the moment we booked it was a great experience... booking was a snap, then we received an email with local weather information and updates the day before we were to arrive, nice touch! The lobby was beautiful check in was very professional and friendly, received coupons to local restaurants and stores. Room was beautifully decorated, comfy and very affordable. Nice indoor pool! Great place to stay!"
POSITIVE,I will be hard pressed to stay any further away from Disneyland than 200 yards from the Front Entrance. The fact that the hotel was clean had a decent free continental breakfast and the service was very friendly was a bonus. Having only one toilet and sink for 6 adults took some time management but was not really problem. Several decent eating establishments [?] nearby and a Target a few blocks away for supplies was very handy. Highly recommended as long as you don't need 4 Star luxury.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was alright, but it was not 2.5 star quality. I have paid less and gotten more before. Higher classed Motel in stead of a 2.5 star Hotel.Pros: Pool. Cons: Cost according to star level."
POSITIVE,Out dated ac unit was loud and not energy efficiency.
NEGATIVE,"Your front desk staff was horrible. I stated to one of the young(est) lady that she seemed to be being a little snappy. She was processing things so fast as if I were being moved down an assembly line. I did not feel that I was saying it in a rude way but, she was offended I believe. I was just trying to allow her to see that she should be more friendly. I had to come bac in because I did not get the double beds as asked and then it began both ladies began to jump me with words going back and forth. Told the older one to give me the new keys as I had a long ride and was not up for fighting with them verbally. She then asked me did I want to stay there? And asked for keys back. Needless to say more words were exchanged, as I felt she was telling me to go find somewhere else to stay. Of course, that would not have been possible due to it was Labor Day weekend at about 9 pm. That was the most aweful experience that I can recall ever! I was also told that the cost would be $85 of course it was more. No no no! In recommending your hotel at this time. Thank you. Karen Bowser"
POSITIVE,"Hotel accomodations are great, But, it's the view that is wonderful."
POSITIVE,"Favorite was location + comfort/cleanliness of room. Loved the ""clean"" tv remote! TV had no pay-per-view option for current movies nor dvd player for a quiet night in after tiring day of activity Perfect in town location; walk to restaurants, shops. I have been traveling quite a lot lately and would say this was the cleanest hotel room I've stayed in for over a year! (This includes some premium, luxury properties.) The room looked to have been recently updated and the furnishings relatively little used. A mini fridge in the room was very appreciated for snacks, trail foods, etc., and was also seemingly brand new. No off odors or stains. Bed linens and towels were sparkling white and the bed was laden with extra pillows. Mattress was also very comfy. We found the breakfast adequate with whole and cut fruit, eggs and multiple bread and cereal options, juices, coffee. It is a small area, though and we were fortunate that our room was not too far so that we could bring our selections back to the room. We also had a pull out sofa, along with 2 queen beds, and a very nice leather chair & ottoman. Staff were all friendly & accommodating. We didn't use the pool but it was covered by a temporary enclosure for off season, and looked clean and inviting. All in all, a really great stay in a beautiful area!"
POSITIVE,"The parking was great even at $10 per day. Underground ramp. Was a bit frustrated that when I called the hotel to ask about parking, I was informed that parking was free. Only to arrive and find that it was $10 per day."
POSITIVE,"Great Place to Stay!. Very Clean, Great Staff!!!. Only drawback was you had to pay $10.00 for parking per night. Otherwise 4 out of 5 stars!"
POSITIVE,"This was one of our more pleasant stays on the road. From Check-in to Check-out, our stay was most pleasant. We were trated with grace and respect in a most courteous manor. The accomodations were spit spot clean, well decorated, and most comfortable. An excellent Value for the price paid. As great as the accomodations were, the perk breakfast was exceptional. The best breakfast of any we have had at a Best Western in the past 100 stays! The breakfast was a $20 value in itself.. We would highly recommend the Kings Inn. Room Tip: Call in advance and use your AARP or Veterans discount programs See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,"I'd prefer staying here to the Desert Inn Suites unless I have a large group coming with me. Â It's so expensive to go to Disneyland, that I'm always on more of a budget -- for time, for money. What I like about this hotel is that it's a little cleaner and slightly more up-to-date than some of the other nearby hotels. Â It doesn't feel run-down, and it's got free internet even in the rooms. Â It also comes with a continental breakfast with a couple of hot breakfast items at Captain Kidds. Â Score! Â On the downside, you'll pay for parking if you're driving in from out-of-town."
POSITIVE,"Excellent value, excellent staff, great hotel for the price. Pros: Staff found a on the spot room that perfectly matched my needs."
POSITIVE,It was clean.
NEGATIVE,"I must have misread. No breakfast available in hotel, only a $5 coupon IF you pay $10 for breakfast. If you pay $9.98, it does not apply. Temperature not controlled well in room. Had trouble getting HOT water in tub."
NEGATIVE,"We stayed here for one night...ocean view room, not a suite, was only available . This was recently remodeled. For 300 $ a night you expect something better. Cornered first floor room was what I got after the phone reservation confirmed 2nd floor room the day before.. The room was clean and remodeled but you can definetly find much better deals facing the ocean with better breakfast and location. The location of the hotel is nice on a cliff but don't expect a beach access.. I give it 2 stars given the price which was too much for the service provided in pismo area. I stayed in nearby hotels before with less much money and much better service."
POSITIVE,It was nice and clean. It was close to the beach and great location.
NEUTRAL,"My trip got off to a rocky start. The flight was delayed, I had a 45 minute wait for my shuttle. And while I was waiting for my airport shuttle, all I could think was how nice and comfy my room would be when I finally arrived. Well Yes the room was nice, comfy, and beautiful. But check-in was a bit of a hassle. When I booked my room I assumed it was 100% paid for. The email that I printed said ""Charged $507"". I guess I needed to read between the lines. So when I checked in the guy asked for a credit card to charge the full payment and a deposit. I told him about the email and I said Room Tip: book well in advance and look for deals on their website if you are staying for more than 2 days"
NEGATIVE,"I made the mistake of booking hotel Carib instead of Emerald Beach. The water in the guest room smelled very bad and was brown. We were not offered any bottled water and was told we could buy our own from the vending machine. The good things - the bed was quite comfortable, we watched several hbo cable movies to pass the time and we were able to walk to the airport for our 7am flight. We walked to the Emerald Beach hotel for lunch (take your swimming gear with you) and caught the $1 bus on the main street in to town for the afternoon. The night auditor was very apologetic for the problems with the water and was very nice."
NEGATIVE,"This is in no way a resort. It is a crumbly hotel sitting 100 yards from the St. Thomas airport gate. The rooms have decent air conditioning but are still musty. The beds have poor mattresses and our sheets had crumbs under the threadbare bedspread. The towels are embarrassing but we didn't really need them because the water was brown and smelled bad out of the tap. The staff are very nice and as helpful as they can be. The bar overlooking the bay is actually wonderful and the food is very good. The bartender was great. There is a ""pool"" but no beach although the view of the bay is nice from the bar and ""better"" rooms. The only reason to stay at this hotel is if you must spend the night on St. Thomas for logistical reasons related to air travel when starting or finishing a trip to the BVI or St. John. Think of it as a scenic primitive campground."
POSITIVE,Very clean
POSITIVE,Spent one night here. The place was full. Check in was pleasant. Room is fairly large and everything works - a rare find these days. Free breakfast. USA today in lobby and excellent wifi. Nice toiletries. Flat screen with a simple remote. Would stay here again. Lots of pillows and comfy bed. Soundproofing mediocre. Of course it would help if parents didn't let their children run up and down the hallways.
POSITIVE,"Great location, which means you can walk in an evening to a great restaurant for dinner (Jeffreys) and you are across the road from a great place for breakfast (Peace Tree). Whilst the room rate for this hotel includes breakfast - it is not great! Paper plates, and not a great selection. We just grabbed a piece of fruit and hot footed it into Moab. Rooms are large and clean, and there is an outside pool area which although we didn't use, some guests did and it looked clean and tidy. Would stay here again"
NEUTRAL,Nice hotel rooms. Very clean. Breakfast was very good and staff was friendly. 5 minutes away from Dollywood.
POSITIVE,"The morning walk to Disneyland was the best feature of the hotel. everything is quite basic. Clean but outdated rooms, small parking lot, basic front desk service. A little more attention to details would make this a better place to stay. Swimming pool was good; better amenities would make it great. Overall: good value for money, but don't expect a steal."
POSITIVE,"We stayed December 1-21st 2011. Could see Disney Claifornia from room. Took ten minutes to walk to Disney. Staff very helpful. Rooms clean. Beds comfortable. Have stayed in several motels around Disney over the years, this is the one we will always return to. Stay away from Edon Roc across the street, it is a hole and they decieve with their pics on the internet. Room Tip: If you want to watch Disney Fire works at night from Motel ask for the top floor over looking the pool."
POSITIVE,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in, close to Disneyland and restaurants. I love the two big pools and 2 huge spas and one little mini for little baby's. my stay here at this hotel was very enjoyable, my parents were happy I chose this hotel and my little brothers were amazed. the room was really neat, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was very good and clean and spacious but they didn't have any SCRAMBLE EGGS!!! either then that it was perfect, excellent hotel staff and maid's on time with any request of towels. If you plan to stay here choose room 436 it is all the way at the end right in front of the pool and parking in front of the room is mostly always available and very quiet room. FYI: internet was not that fast in my room but did connect just took time to search."
POSITIVE,"Good location within walking distance of convention centre, bars and restaurants. safe area to walk. The breakfast room is very small and breakfast food very limited and not replenished with great regularity. Pros: Reasonable price Cons: Breakfast facilities Location: Good location felt safe walking in area"
NEUTRAL,"The location is perfect, just a quick jump to the Colorado River, Arches National Park, Dead Horse Park and Canyonlands. The room was actually quite nice, the only problem with it is that you can hear the person above you. If you are on the second floor it's no problem, just try to avoid the bottom floor. Teal at the front desk was very helpful. We had checked out and grabbed some food to go at the place across the street and Teal chased us down to tell us that my wife had left her sweatshirt in the room. Good Value and great location."
POSITIVE,The staff was very helpful on providing directions to SeaWorld as well as local eating in the area. Originally we had boooked hotel for multiple nights but due to inclement weather the amusement parks were closed. The hotel very graciouslt refunded our additional nights with no penalties or problems.
POSITIVE,"I'm impressed with this hotel! It's beautiful! The room has a fridge, freezer, coffee maker and the best part... a microwave! They also have a flat screen TV with a list of channels. That just makes it much easier! They have a pool too and free continental breakfast! Yummm! I love how everything is clean and the staff is friendly. Oh, and you can get a discount if you have AAA!"
POSITIVE,"Wonderful satffs , they are helpful, professional, and friendly. Nothing I can think of."
NEGATIVE,The beds were very uncomfortable and run down as well as the rest of the room. The front door would not even close all the way. You could see light come through from outside. They had a smoking area about 10 to 15ft away and the smoke would come right into the room. We packed light so we could do laundry at the hotel later to find out that there was only one washer and dryer working.
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our stay there. The hotel has all of the accomations that you need for an enjoyable vacation. The staff is friendly and will meet all of your needs. The next time we visit Galveston we will book our room here again.
POSITIVE,"Excellent hotel, close to the park. Rooms are beautiful and large. The staff is helpful and a huge breakfast buffet is included with the price of the room."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I were on our way to Florida and decided to stop for the night. We trust Best Western and the quality and friendly service we always encounter when staying at a Best Western property and we were not disappointed here. From the moment we entered the lobby we were warmly greeted and checked in efficiently. Our room was well appointed and comfortable. The bed was comfortable and we felt we were in a safe location as well. The breakfast the next morning was wonderful. We had cereal, waffles, and fresh fruit. If passing through the area again, we would certainly return to this property. Thanks so much!"
POSITIVE,Me an my husband stayed at this hotel an this town for the first time. The rooms where very clean an the beds are very comfortable the price was perfect...Our son an his golf team also stayed at this same motel an they said the same thing
NEGATIVE,"Not much, the breakfast was okay The King size bed in our room was horrible! It was hard as a rock."
POSITIVE,"Best Western Inn in Blairsville,GA.- I really don't understand some of the bad reviews. My room was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I definitely would recommend this hotel to any of my friends. I had a great stay and can't wait to go back!!!"
POSITIVE,I just returned from an overnight stay with my 8 year old grandson and his 10 year old brother. Everyone was so friendly at the hotel and the CoCo Key Waterpark. Our room was ready and extremely comfortable. The waterpark was fantastic. We even ordered food from Tilted Kilt for lunch and they delivered it to us at the waterpark. We will definitely return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Room Tip: not a bad room
NEGATIVE,"The ONLY thing this resort has going for it, is it's proximity to the beach. Â The rooms are horribly in need of a a good cleaning. Â The grounds and landscaping are poorly maintained, with sand blowing over and covering the stairs to the beach. Â The beach is still accessible, just you are walking on a ramp of sand, where the stairs should be. Â  The long and short of it is, this is a 1 star hotel that is charging 5 star rates, and they can get away with it because of their location. To add insult to injury, there is a parking fee, if you have a vehicle. Â  NOT recommended."
NEGATIVE,"Yea it is a dump. Liked: Service Disliked: Location, Food, Value, Rooms"
POSITIVE,"For the price of the hotel, it's superb - absolutely clean, nice staff and the hot breakfast is an extra."
POSITIVE,"Location, free breakfast, fast and friendly service. Noisy This hotel is located in an ideal location. There are several eateries, shoppingn and gas stations in the area. We really enjoyed the free breakfast because we were expecting it to be so delicious. The only problems we experienced were loud noises from people passing, and the helicopters from the hospital next door."
NEUTRAL,Breakfast Misleading information about shuttle to event on the website
POSITIVE,"This was our second time staying at this hotel. Our room was clean, the free breakfast was one of the better hotel breakfasts. The hotel personnel were friendly. The queen bed was more like a double bed, but besides that everything was fine."
NEGATIVE,The first night the air conditioning didn't work making it very warm and the bed was too hard so we got very little sleep. Next day we were given another room in which the A/C worked but the bed was still too hard. We got no rebate due to thenon-functioning A/C unit. The breakfast was good We'll try the Days Inn next time we go to Dartmouth
POSITIVE,Stayed here twice in the last month and will return. Only complaint was that WIFI was difficult to access and stay on line.
NEUTRAL,"This is a rather average motel. Nothing really wrong but nothing really special either. The room seemed a little dated. The linens on the bed were rather thin and old. The room was a nice size and clean. We paid an extra $10 for a mountain view. However, we were on the first floor and a tree blocked most of the mountain. It certainly wasn't worth an extra $10. The free breakfast was above average with lots of choices. Room Tip: Paying extra for a mountain view might not be worth it."
NEUTRAL,"I stay here on business fairly regularly. This motel is an acceptable place to stay, but is not particularly enjoyable. It is clean and the rooms are fairly quiet - it is fuly functional with a comfortable bed. The rooms are bare bones, with a table and 2 chairs and an old TV. The rooms are not aestetically pleasing, with wall lamps with wires hanging down. If you must stay in Robinson, stay here and ask for a room in the newer building, but don't expect too much. Room Tip: Ask for a room in the newer building"
POSITIVE,"NEWLY RENOVATION ON THE INTERIOR, EXTERIOR RENOVATION IN PROCESS BUT NO PROBLEMS"
POSITIVE,"Price is good, place is ok, maintained well enough, staff prompt and friendly."
POSITIVE,Hotel is a a awesome location to Silver Dollar City with a shuttle bus back & forth. Breakfast was great & heated INDOOR pool & game room for the kids. All staff encountered were down home friendly especially nice & helpful front desk staff. Room Tip: either side has great views but we had a suite on the 3rd floor....great connecting room to it for f...
POSITIVE,"Excellent place. The rooms are excellent in the Tuscan wing. The rooms are very quiet, spacious, and clean. The hotel is conveniently located near town, wineries, and 101. Combine all of that with the price, and this is a terrific place. Room Tip: Definitely ask for the Tuscan wing."
POSITIVE,We had a 6 person occupancy room for our family. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. The only thing missing is room service.
POSITIVE,"Hubby & I decided to take a 3-day (9/6 - 9/8) get-a-way and take a friend with us since he ""never goes anywhere."" Found the BW very easily. We had never been to San Clemente before and found it to be very nice with a nice Pier (& restaurant on the Pier), a nice walking trail all along the beach, lots of shops & restaurants AND the Amtrak and Metrolink trains run right along the beach and best of all could not hear their whistles from the BW Casablanca Inn during sleeping hours. The BW provided a minimal breakfast (cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, fruit, hard boiled eggs, juice, tea & coffee). Beds were very comfy & the flat-screen TV's have great reception. Friend had a connecting room. Has an OK pool & small work-out room. It's about a 5-min ride to the Pier and bring lots of quarters for parking meters at the beach between 10:00- 5:00......I would recommend the BW Casablanca Inn! Room Tip: As far as I could tell there were no rooms with a good view!"
NEGATIVE,"Not what claim to be Disliked: Rooms, Service, Food"
POSITIVE,"We were in Toronto for a theatre excursion and stayed overnight at this property. The entire experience was top notch. The staff and service impeccable, the facility clean and well kept. We were in a king room with plenty of space, a large hd tv, an ipod dock in the clock radio, a small fridge and ample coffee and tea. The bathroom had a superb shower. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed a good nights sleep. The vallee parking very efficient. The breakfast was nicely set out and your choice of buffet, continental or menu. After we checked in and had settled into the room, the front desk called to see if everything was alright, a nice touch. We would definately stay here again. Room Tip: Call the hotel direct. Don't use Downttown Hotels Toronto. They quote prices in USD??"
NEGATIVE,Tub did not drain rite . stood in ankle deep water . Not enough electrical outlets . Bulding needs updating !!!! Staff were great .
POSITIVE,Not far from airport Outside door entry
POSITIVE,"We recently stayed here on our way down to Florida and arrived after 11pm. The front desk agent was very courteous and helpful. After a speedy check in, we proceeded to the room, 2 double beds, non smoking, the room was clean and comfortable, nothing special, but good enough, as we just needed a place to rest until we got back on the road in the morning. The beds were comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. This is a great place to stop and its just off I 75, We would definatley stay again next time we drive to florida."
POSITIVE,"We were in ohio for a few days, the room was clean, staff friendly, the pool was nice for my daughter, free breakfast. Didnt have any issues, would stay there again"
NEGATIVE,Room was not clean. It was not done upon check in so we had to wait outside the room while it was cleaned abd we was in a hurry. Not happy
NEGATIVE,"The Desk was way to small, the bed past replacement date and this is a"" Motor"" hotel, with the thin outside door where you can here everyone outside, all the time! For $20.00 more there are better choices."
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Coral Hills was a great place to stay for the night. The rooms were excellent, very nicely done and the bed was comfortable. We used the outdoor pool which was nice and I appreciated the free wi-fi and breakfast. The location was great and it was an easy drive to Tuacahn! The front desk agent was a trainee but she did an excellent job and was very engaging and polite. I would recommend this hotel!"
POSITIVE,"As Director of a nationwide program, I run events all over the country, working with hotels using conference rooms and other facilities. All attendees work directly with the hotel to book their own reservations. For the past 3 years, we have continued to come back to the Sunrise Best Western. Each time has been a great success, not only in working with them directly, but also in the glowing comments we receive in our exit surveys complimenting this hotel and its staff. The locations is superb. Just a short walk (or trikke ride ;-) to the pier, or the strand, and many good dining options available to choose from. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed, and the breakfast is substantial. All the staff, from the Gen. Mngr to the maintenance people, have always been friendly, helpful, and have gone over and above to ensure their guests are well taken care of. For us ... Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,The receptionist at the desk was outstanding. She made two very tired travelers feel very welcome and well-accommodated.
POSITIVE,"Hotel staff, rooms and breakfast were adequate. Location is not in the best part of the town. I would stay more downtown if available, but would not hesitate to return to this hotel in the future."
POSITIVE,"Clean, quiet, comfortable room and bed, good complimentary breakfast offering, great location adjacent to I95, Brunswick, St. Simons Island and Jekyll Island. Very helpful and friendly front desk personnel. Plenty of places nearby for dining. Excellent value.. Pros: cleanliness, friendly staff, very comfortable room, bed Cons: none Location: totally convenient"
NEGATIVE,"On our first day of staying there we called the front desk, (which would not answer very often), and told them there was something wrong with the toilet. It would not even flush toilet paper let alone anything else. I have 3 children all grown now and I no how a toilet acts when a brush or a comb or possibly a tampon has been flushed down. I finally got in touch with the front dest to tell them my concern, and they ask if I was holding the handle down until all the water had finished emptying the tank. I tried that, and still took 7- 10 tries to flush a #2. I called them back and they said they would send someone up to look at it. Their solution to this..... They brought me a plunger and left it with me to try and fix the toilet. The Hotel was full or I would have ask for a room switch. Would I stay their again? Possibly, everthing worked fine except the toilet and no matter what time you took a shower the water would go from Hot to cold for no reason. I Even tried taking one at 3:30 am before checking out so there should have been plenty of Hot water. Again, good location, close to BYU campus and our daughter apartment, close to Football stadiuim. Pet freindly, for $25 extra charge. I have stayed at the La Quinta and had a much better experience. Given everything that jhappened, I would probably give them another chance to prove themselves. I have no complaints about the House keeping staff, very freindly and kept our room nide"
POSITIVE,"There were some mechanical problems with the room, but overall a fine experience. The breakfast offered was certainly adequate and the staff was very friendly, will probably stay here again in the future."
POSITIVE,"Superb room, very clean and comfortable. Loved the huge bed, good breakfast and the pool area - especially the flume. Some noise from planes overhead but not enough to be a problem and certainly not enough to keep you awake or disturb your sleep."
POSITIVE,Stopped here on our way to the beach. Very good location about an our north of Destin/Mirimar Beach. Quite and clean with a pull-out for child #3 to sleep on. Would stay here again when making that trip. .
NEGATIVE,"The hotel made my boyfriend and I feel uncomfortable and there were people loitering in the parking lot. The hotel is located right on the outside of Northern Illinois University. The physical look of the hotel is rundown and needs to be updated. However, the service was great because the employees were very understanding and helpful."
POSITIVE,NO complaints very pleasant stay. Excellent experience for the money.
NEUTRAL,free parking
NEGATIVE,"I had thought we would be staying in a more upscale motel from the nearby Comfort Inn where we have stayed many years in the past. This Best Western used to be the old Howard Johson's. It was dark and depressing, and though redone, it was simply creepy. The front desk first gave us the wrong key so we had to go back down and have a new key calibrated. Then, as my husband and I were getting ready to leave for the evening, another family came barging in our room, with their dog. They said we had their room. I was not happy to hear that we were staying in a room where dogs typically stay as I have so many bad allergies.. Then, when we got home, again, my husband had to go downstairs and get another key as we couldn't get in again. There was also no coffeepot in our room. The mattress on my bed was not comfortable and was sloping at the bottom of the bed. The view out of the window was non-existent as we faced some sort of industrial equipment. I will never go back and do not understand how any of the good reviews could have given this place anything other than the lowest marks. I would prefer the Comfort Inn over this place. The only thing I liked about it was its location near Lockwood."
POSITIVE,"Todays Lunch Special is Chickenstrip Wrap with French Fries for 6.99! Our delicious lunch buffet features BBQ Ribs, Chicken and Noodle Casserol...tasty sides, full deluxe salad bar, broccoli cheese soup and minnestroni...dessert bar 7.99 for seniors and 8.99 for adults under 55! Hope to see you!"
POSITIVE,"Clean, new close to airport"
NEGATIVE,"Luis Feb 16,2012 For last minute hotel is OK. Room old odor, but clean . Front desk person is also housekeeper and mini cafeteria attendant.There are 5, two chairs table for guests, free breakfast but simple .Expensive taxi 30 dollars from LAX Airport. Liked: Rooms, Location, Service, Food, Value"
POSITIVE,"Staff was very friendly and competent. Room was comfortable. the only shortfall was the cabler tv it was sparse, lots of financial but no ESPN"
POSITIVE,"Hey guys, it's not the Hilton or even the Marriott Marquis in Times Square (the hotel we stayed at four days prior), but it was a clean, convenient place to stay when our flight was canceled due to weather & we were stranded in St. Louis. The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly. The rooms were clean and a/c worked wonderfully. The furniture & appliance were outdated, but I couldn't expect much more for such a good price. I wouldn't say it is a hotel I would normally stay at, but it served its purpose and exceeded my expectations."
POSITIVE,"We had a very nice stay there. I tore my Achilles tendon while at a track meet there, but that had, of course, nothing to do with the nice motel--the only real positive thing for me that weekend."
POSITIVE,"We are very happy with the hotel. The pool / games area is our favourite part. Our children love this hotel! A great family get away and with prices like you can get on hotels.com, its a win-win!!!"
POSITIVE,"We like to stay here when we are flying from LAX, this hotel is about 30-40 min from the airport depending on traffic. it is conveniently located near the 101 freeway. There are several cute resturants near by, within walking distance. The place is clean affordable and has cool suites w/ a whirlpool tub in the room. We like to return to this Best Western time and again. Geart guest service, I just mentioneda small problem w/ the room uponcheck out and they took 10% off for me."
NEGATIVE,It was awful. We' moved immediately! don't know where that 5 million dollar renovation went!!!!
POSITIVE,I loved it ....loved the view...loved the pools ...loved the jaccuzzies ....just loved the experience .........it was what I needed ... loved the free parking ...I just wish it came with breakfast....
POSITIVE,"Not fancy, but great. We liked everything: netbook in the room, heated swimming pool, gym and breakfast. My navigation (Garmin) shows it around 3000, not 1008 Us Highway 92 W."
POSITIVE,"Stayed her for one night on a recent visit to Bryce Canyon. Perfectly located close to Bryce, this budget hotel is a perfect place to base yourself for visiting Bryce. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious , new and spotless. Best Western is the only hotel chain I have visited that has new sanitary covers for the TV remote for each new guest. What a great idea. I hope more hotels catch on to this."
POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Merry Manor. The rooms were clean, the food in the Governor's Dining Room was very good, home baking was good, pool was fantastic - all in all we enjoyed our stay."
NEGATIVE,"We stayed two nights here, mostly for its good location to the airport and downtown. It is an old hotel, which isn't a problem in itself if it is kept up. Checking in was easy. The room was average and relatively clean (the bath grout could use better cleaning). The beds were comfortable enough and the pillows good. There are only two floors to the hotel, so the first floor windows face the parking lot - not so great, and the second floor windows face a fire station across the street - not so great when they get calls in the middle of the night. The hotel is next to the freeway, making it easy to get where you're going, and super close the the airport. The toilet in our bathroom kept running after flushing. Since it had taken so long earlier in the day to ask a question at the front counter (no one was around), I decided it would be quicker to try and fix it myself than call and wait. I stuck my arm into the tank and re-hooked the plastic chain that had come off because it was too short. Luckily, I know how to do this, but some people might not. Anyway, who wants to stick their arm in a hotel toilet tank anyway? Definitely not the highlight of our stay. (Should have gotten a discount for fixing their toilet !) They offer a full breakfast, but be sure you are there first thing in the morning. Once they run out of something, if there is less than an hour remaining for breakfast (which ends at 10 am), they will not make more. Both mornings we arrived for breakfast at 9:30 am. One morning they were out of bacon but would not make more - ""we're closing soon"", and the second morning they were out of biscuits - same excuse ""we can't make more, we're closing soon"". In fact, they don't wait until 10am to close, they start packing it all up at 9:40. I told my son to run up to the counter and grab what he might want because they were putting everything away 20 minutes earlier than we expected. We ate our breakfast while the hotel staff wiped tables and threw away trash around us. Not very appetiting. The second morning they were also out of milk, so he couldn't have cereal. No biscuits, no cereal. He had a banana and toast. (The first morning we asked if there were more bananas. They brought out more, but all were covered with black spots - too ripe! The second morning the bananas were better.) The woman working the breakfast bar was not friendly and a bit short when we asked about replenishing the empty trays. The lobby computer worked fine;. In room, I could use my iPad, then printed out boarding passes in the lobby. No problem there. We got a note in our room that there were a slew of car break-ins in the area, so that wasn't particuarly reassuring. But we never leave valuables in our car anyway."
POSITIVE,"very helpful staff, clean rooms, great view. definitely staying here again :)"
POSITIVE,"Breakfast was great, but no meat. Mostly all bread."
NEGATIVE,"Our room had a faulty motion detecting switch above the sink that would flash on the middle of the night; the heater fan rattled noisily; the phone message light blinked constantly, even with no messages on it; there was no towel bar in the sink area -- you had to walk into the bathtub/toilet room to get or hang a towel; and you had to push 4-5 buttons [?] on 2 remotes to get the TV on and off. Friendly staff, but they need to do major maintenance. Hire a handyman!"
POSITIVE,The hotel stay was nice. The rooms are equipped with the essentials plus free wifi. Includes free morning breakfast.
POSITIVE,We have stayed here twice in the last 3 months for our son's basic training and AIT training graduations from Fort Jackson. Very clean with great service!
POSITIVE,Great easy in and out to I-5. Rooms and location is quiet. Staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.
POSITIVE,The room was cleean and the staff was very responsive. This was a great value.
POSITIVE,"Has the basic needs and even offers a little more than that. great, room , very spacious, LOVED that I could open the windows. People were nice, convenient and overall great experience for business or leisure. Have stayed there before and will stay again!Pros: The room was clean and very comfortable- people were very nice. Cons: I don't have anything to write here."
POSITIVE,"Was happily surprised by the nice welcome, large room (would have been small for the 4 persons it could fit, we weÂ´re only 2), OK breakfast (just something to get you started), great location."
POSITIVE,I have stayed here several times. It is centrally located and the price is more than reasonable. There is no charge for parking.
POSITIVE,"We were only in town for a short stay but this hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was very polite and helpful, they even made a good recommendation for mexican food.(The old Mexican Inn) We will stay here again."
POSITIVE,"We had a great stay at the Best Western Truman Inn. Rooms were clean. Staff was very helpful. Great location to everything in the greater kc area. They had a great breakfast with the neatest fresh pancake machine, you just press a button and 2 pancakes are made quickly while you wait. we will stay there again."
POSITIVE,Im was able to leave my vehicle there for 7 nights while traveling by plane.
POSITIVE,"Seemed kinda strange on the outside, but was very nice inside! Kind of shocked really. Free breakfast in the restaurant after your stay. A great stop in the middle of nothing."
POSITIVE,"Very good for the price, everything was as expected."
POSITIVE,"Everything was excellent! Staff, room, parking, cleanliness, quietness, and location--all great. AM continental breakfast was typical--good enough for a quick bite only. Fairly reasonable price for this area as well. I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,I enjoy my two day stay at this hotel. I go to St. George at least three times a year and have tried several other hotels in the area and this was one of the better ones. The rooms are large and clean. The building seems to be well cared for. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The only problem i had was the hot water took awhile to reach my room on the third floor. My friends staying on the first floor did not have this problem. All in all I enjoyed my stay and will book rooms here again.
POSITIVE,"I was little nerveous when I read the reviews when I was searching for a motel. It wasn't the motel but the town. People were calling it a dump. I think it is a loveley town and the motel was great, the people were so nice and helpful. It was a very nice stay at the Best Western in Huron."
POSITIVE,Staff is very friendly and kind. Room and view were amazing. Pros: The friendly staff and amazing view. Cons: The fog lol. Location: The location is great with a view of the ocean on a clear day. Coronado bridge was visible during our stay.
NEGATIVE,"My door key didn't work, nor did the two replacements. I was not offered another room, and wound up locking myself in for the night. Not a comfortable situation..."
POSITIVE,"As the name implies, ""Best"" Western, The Abbey Inn is the best. A great place to stay at a very reasonable price, We have stayed here several times in the past and it just keeps getting better. The rooms are super nice and clean. Plenty of towels, the staff is more that helpful and friendly. The crowds at the breakfast bar was a testimony of the food....plenty of it and great tasting. We haven't left yet but are looking forward to our next visit."
POSITIVE,"The inn was nice well appointed, kinda close to where we were going, it was clean the rooms were updated besides the hard wire wifi. No hot tub but there was a semi heated pool a work out room spa and sauna. The t.v was super large so it was great to catch the 49er game on sunday. There is a resturant on site although we only ate the breakfast wich was great for a Best Western! i should know I am a employee thrugh the chain. Alfie was at the front desk and answered all of my tons of questions, he was super friendly and helpful. The only downside was there was no towels in our room and when we checked in the door was propped open as if it was not yet finished. However that would not effect my descion to stay again."
POSITIVE,They were very accomodating. Our room 504had a beautiful.view of the.city. The transportation to subway was excellent. Breakfast was well stocked. Not a bad thing to talk about.
POSITIVE,This is a nice hotel but they put on a great breakfast which is inluded with the room. More than continental.
POSITIVE,"We have had the pleasure to stay at the Best Western in Annapolis, MD. a few times. On each occassion we have been impressed with the personal attention given by the staff as well as the cleanliness and basic order of our accomadations. The staff pays attention to details and requests in the reservation and make every attempt to accomodate. The hotel offers complimentary deluxe continental breakfast each morning with service provided by a wonderful lady with a beautiful spirit and smile. I recommend you give these folks a try, I promise you will return. Keep up the good work my friends!!!! Viktoria Murvin Room Tip: Be precise in your requests when making your reservations"
NEGATIVE,"The fridge stank and had mold. The bed spreads were from 1974. The lobby looked good, the room really sucked. It was as if every thing had a film on it. Didn't really want to touch any thing. Wouldn't stay again. The breakfast was meager but ok. Room Tip: Don't stay here. There is a Holiday Inn Express two blocks away. May cost more but probably worth it. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Self Laundry Facility. Free parking, Nice rooms. Airport shuttle, Shower head was taller than me and I am 6'7"". That is rare to find! Soda machine was in garage Right across the street from the marina and if you want a view of it get something above the 3rd floor. Nice clean, updated hotel and friendly helpful staff. The room was nicely setup and the bed was very comfortable. The public bus that goes to downtown has a stop right across the street which is a real treat. Get a bus pass for $5.00 that lasts all week and no need for a car. But the hotel does have a self parking garage and it's complimentary which was a nice surprise. The free shuttle to the airport was handy and the morning continental breakfast is good too."
POSITIVE,"appearance and breakfast nothing Rockville, MD. - close to D.C. Great experience-no problems. Would recommend! We especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet. All staff were pleasant and helpful-no attitudes. Pet friendly if we would have needed that amenity.Showers were good and personal items were high quality.Little touches mean a lot"
NEUTRAL,TV didn't work. Otherwise fine. The room was clean. I liked the staff.
POSITIVE,"This is a very nice hotel. Stayed in one of the suites, it was very nicely done. The beds were great and the room was very clean. Very good value for the room we were in. Checked in late without any issues. Staff was friendly, I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was clean and a great value when you are busy touring southern california. Rooms were large and clean, nice pool area, breakfast was good. It is a bit out of the way for disney ( about a 10 to 15 minute drive) but central if you are taking in the beach. Huntington beach is a must if weather permits!"
NEUTRAL,"I think of Best Western Plus Suites as being above average, but I did not think this hotel met that criteria. It was adequate for our stay and just down the street from the Marcus Whitman Hotel and much more reasonably priced. Breakfast was served, although the coffee ran out frequently, requiring a wait for the next pot of about 5 minutes. t might have been good to have another pot going instead of waiting for the coffee to run out. Also, it would have been helpful for the staff to have city maps available when giving directions. Our room was adequate, but the facility seemed a little tired."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel sucks, noisy disgusting and was the worst bed i think i ever slept in. I should have slept in my car! complete rip off."
POSITIVE,We booked this hotel at an extremly low rate so we really didn't expect much. We were positivly surprised. Hotel is at a good location off I75. We did not hear the freeway from our room which was the first surprise. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable - I would say the most imortant at a hotel stay. Overall a bit outdates and the corridors could use a refresh but that did not really bother at this hotel. Breakfast was sufficient with lots of tables. Food was ok. Outside pool and hot tub was also nice to have available. No 5star standard but for the price of the room a more than nice to have. We liked it. Parking was more than enough available right in front of the door. Couple of restaurants (also 24h IHOP) right next door. Shopping around the corner and beaches not too far away. Friendly stuff also at check in and check out to make this stay actually very good. We would recommend this place if booked at a discount price - then excellent value for the little money. Room Tip: chose room at the Western part (furthest away of I75) of the hotel - and to the backside (South/poolside). They are most quiet
POSITIVE,"Very clean,very helpful staff..would stay again"
POSITIVE,Great Value for having a place to go to be safe on New Years Eve after having drinks. 6 mile taxi ride from Sterling Regal Plaza - Perfect!
POSITIVE,This place was wonderful. The beds were nice and comfy. The hotel staff was also very helpful and nice.
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed this hotel. For the price which included wifi, breakfast and parking it is hard to beat. The pool area is not very big but it wasn't very busy so it was ok. We would go back if we wanted to stay in downtown PS again as the location is great. There are lots of shops and restaurants within a couple of blocks."
POSITIVE,I had a very comfortable stay . The staff was very helpful and kind. The room was clean and comfortable. The pillows are a bit uncomfortable but everything else was great.
POSITIVE,"Nice room, plenty of parking, easy access to interstate.....only issue might be no refrig"
NEUTRAL,"The staff and the bus to the Tropicana were great and the room was comfortable. I liked the size of the room and the kitchen. I just found some of the other guests and the nearby area to be a bit creepy. I sense that the value compared to that of Atlantic City attracts an interesting array of people, but I also got the feeling that not everyone there was traveling. I would definitely consider this hotel over the other nearby options, but I think I may just avoid the area all together in the future."
NEGATIVE,This hotel charges $2 a night for a safe that I did not want.
POSITIVE,"Booked this room the same day on the web due to the price and star rating. Very good front desk staff (Hi, Thom) who genuinely want to ensure all is okay. Good size room. Very clean. Good furnishings. Even had a jacuzzi tub! Far enough off the highway to be quiet. Free wireless. Free continental breakfast was okay. Probably paid $20 to $30+ less than other comparable hotels in the area."
POSITIVE,"Much better than I would have expected for the price. Comfortable bed, clean room, overall good facilities. We were very impressed. Traffic noise from nearby roads could be heard at night, but I guess the same could be said of most motels."
POSITIVE,"Coming from the Kennedy Space Ctr, we were exhausted! The hotel was a welcome site, very comfortable beds, and lots of stores and restaurants around the area. We would stay again if were in this area."
POSITIVE,"Have stayed at the this hotel on several seperate occasion while visiting my girlfriend. The staff was very friendly and professional. In particular Dean the hotel manager, and several front desk personnel (Joe, George and Thom). They make you feel welcome when checking in and very helpful in finding good places to eat and places of interest. My girlfriend hurt herself and I had to take her to an Urgentcare and George recommended one to us and it turned out to be an excellent experience and I thank George for that.The rooms are very nice and clean. The hotel is within a mile of Jupiter Beach, which was a plus to myself and Janet. There are numerous nice places to eat in the area. The only negative thing I have to say is that the pool, which is very nice, is in need of some renovation. There is a walkway that goes along the intracoastway and is very very nice. The breakfest is very nice and inviting first thing in the morning. Would recommend to anyone and I have already made my reservations for my November trip. Room Tip: All the room are very spacous. We stayed in a King Room near the back door with easy access to the pool on the first floor. The rooms are equipped with a mini fridge and microwave. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We were needing a hotel for one night before we traveled into the City and this was conveniently located off the 80 fwy. There were no 2 bed non smoking rooms available so the desk clerk gave us a larger room that had 3 beds and a little sitting room for the same price. Very nice and unexpected. Small breakfast offerings but coffee was good. Cannot complain based on the price we paid $71 for nite. Room was clean, no complaints and although next to the fwy no fwy noise at all."
POSITIVE,This wasn't the most classy hotel I had ever stayed at. The free breakfast was weak (yogurt and fruit) but everything else was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The pool was indoors and my son enjoyed swimming in it even though it was quite small. Overall enjoyable stay. Would recommend to others. Great value for the price!
POSITIVE,"My four night stay turned into six. This Hotel has great location and wonderful staff except for the overnight clerk (Fernando?) while at the hospital I asked him to do three small thing for me and he didn't do any. (like extend my stay so I didn't get locked out, or have my room cleaned first - I had a recovering solider in the room) The rooms barely contained the two queen size beds but was comfortable, as others described the covers as lumpy so were mine but I got over it (diference between a man and a womens concerns). A real plus is the microwave and fridge the fridge is on the floor so be prepared to get on your knees. Having a sick solider and free DVD's was a real plus watch 2/3 a day. The bathroom was spotless I want to thanks the mother/daughter team how did my room really nice people. Another plus was the pool where management in other hotels cut costs by not heating the pool This management team gave me a heated pool only minus the dry sauna never worked in either the mens room nor the womens and was told its condition was this way for a while. The workout room was nice and did the trick. The hotel has a very decent look form the outside and I wonder it the other reviewers were looking in the other direction lol. The hotel itself was very clean and I enjoyed the my travels down the halls. Being in this hotel for six nights I only missed one breakfast and that one was my best. The staff did clear and clean the tables on time and stocked the food well BUT the food was at best bland and the fried potatoes weren't worth the effort of putting them on the plate BUT wednesday morning they broke out the waffle maker then never to be seen again. MANAGEMENT waffle makers are now a must at any hotel offering free? Breakfast and I can't imagine why this is not a everyday event cause the hot cakes in a warmer only makes them stiff warm cakes and the wasted time it took to make them could be used learning how to make decent potatoes lol. The little omlets were ok if you got them when they first come out but much better then the scrambled eggs. They have a good selection of juices,fruit,yogert, snack bars the cooking staff couldn't kill and the coffee was great better then dunkin donuts and also always fresh and hot at the front desk, All the days front desk staff were so friendly and helpful when I went to play tourist. A great feature was the Barber on the LL a really nice old man. My only main complaint besides only using the waffle maker once a week is the cleaning staff makes up the rooms really late around noon for me everyday but I don't believe it's their fault because they only come on duty at 9am a little late and different from most hotels I've stayed at BUT I can't complain in any way about the staff. Now if you'd only add the waffle maker everyday and fix the sauna I'd be very thankful. I must mention that on the weekend Management held a Visit from Santa and gave out gifts and pony rides to the watertown community all FREE I wish to thank Management for putting on this event that I know takes up a lot of staff time and owners $$. and expecting nothing in return. For your kindness alone I will use your hotel whenever I'm in the area. One other item the beds and pillows are great best nights sleep (when I did) i've had in a year. Room Tip: your are a close walk to down town and some really good food only a block away from the oldest mall (cute) in the country and muesum"
POSITIVE,"I had a very nice experience at this hotel. everything was great. very friendly staff!!! i hadn't been here in quite a few years, and the girl at the desk, (ashley?) made sure to tell me about the breakfast, and when i went to tell her the ice machine on my floor was not working properly, she called maintenance as i was walking away to go to another machine!! to me that was exceptional. THANKS! even one of the housekeeping staff ask if all was ok as i was either leaving or entering the room!! i really liked that. heck, even some of the other guests were very pleasant. the hottub was very clean although a little heavy on the chlorine. just a great time! thanks, vicki"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was nice, and mostly clean. The only complaint was our non-smoking room smelled like cigarettes. The location to stone mountain was great, and there is tons of shopping and quick bites in the area."
POSITIVE,"Location, location, location as they ay in the uk. It means the location is everything. Ll it is in the case of this best western. It is less than five minute walk to fashion square and the old town is walkable too. It is also handy for a walk along the canal side or a morning jog. There is a circle k and a nice farmers supermarket nearby. Staff. They were truly exceptional. Jude, the manager, has a Local knowledge which is second to none. All of the staff were super friendly and anxious to please. The hotel. Apparat from being in a top location it is spotlessly clean. It is modern, unlike some best westerns which can look a little tired. Great flat screen tv with cable. Very on trend. Wireless Internet connection was fast too. The pool was lovely and quiet with big soft cushions on the sun beds. It's heated too which was nice because the weather wasn't all that during my stay. Breakfast. Was laid on and provided everything we needed, with tea and coffee available all the time. There are drinks and snack machines in the hall too in case you need a chocolate fix. I would came back to this hotel. Room Tip: The one I had was a bit bigg than the other but didn't have a balcony which would have been nice..."
POSITIVE,"This relatively small hotel is very conveniently located near the Historic District. Therefore, it can get a little noisy as is probably true for most hotels in this area. The staff provides superior service and great suggestions for restaurants and attractions. They are also immediately responsive to any concern. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we liked the breakfast. We would definitely stay here again. Room Tip: Ask for a quiet room."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was well located for a three night stay with my adult son. Excellent view. Proximity of ice making machine and pop machine caused us to consider moving, but after being offered a first floor room decided to stay where we were. Machines were being removed or serviced while we were there. Always ask regarding proximity to machines when checking into hotel. We had an excellent view !! A plus that we hadn't counted on was the bar at the hotel--we didn't try the restaurant. The proximity to the pizza/bar restaurant and IHOP were an advantage as both were within walking distance. Pros: The view Cons: Noise from ice maker and pop machine Location: Excellent view from second floor"
POSITIVE,"Warm cookies by the coffee and tea table. A very nice lady who hosted the bkf in the morning. And the warm pool water. I swam later in the day.I did not see any animals.But if I knew that they allowed dogs I would have brought mine.Pros: The person who check us in was ""Cookie"" she was very personable."
POSITIVE,"Needed a place to spend the night while introducing my granddaughter to my favorite college, Georgetown College. Have stayed at all the possible choices in this area and all the possible choices were within eyesight. Didn't know it when I called to see about rates and reservations and the duty clerk was so helpful and the rates better than expected, I booked, knowing if I didn't like the premises when I might just casually check them out, I could cancel and go to something else. Checking in was quick and easy, the hotel extremely better looking than most I have stayed in, and the room just popped my eyeballs it was so nice for so little!!!! Spent a very quite, comfortable night. TV was not flat panel but great picture and lots of channels. Fridge I didn't need, nor microwave, iron, ironing board, soap dispensers were very useful, and so was the hair dryer. All in all.....a very memorable and pleasant experience and if my granddaughter gets admitted to GC, this is the place my family will book at least every other month (she can come see us in the alternate months). Oh...the fitness center was well equipped, but we spent the evening watching the Men and Women TIGERS rip UPike!!! Go TIGERS!!!! Room Tip: Well, it's in their name sorta...but didn't actually need conference rooms etc."
POSITIVE,"Close to a main thoroughfare made it good to get around. Everything looked clean, perhaps it because it's a newer hotel. I hope you keep that freshness. My one and only gripe is that I flew in from the Caribbean that night. My luggage was lost. My winter coat was in the lost luggage so I was freezing cold, in 37 degree weather. I get to the hotel after midnight, freezing. I check in and asked, since the limited parking lot(not stated on the web page) was full, if I could park in the front(there was a space) til 7 am because I didn't have a winter coat, lost my luggage etc. I was told""no"". I asked to speak to the manager, and was told he can't be reached right now, and he wouldn't approve. I had to head out in the 37 degree weather, to find a place to park, and walk all the way back in the freezing cold. That was not a pleasant experience. I feel that they could have been more understanding, after my explanation."
POSITIVE,Excellent stay. Close as you would wish to Airport. Dennys in front and Olympic Restaurant across Genesee Street
POSITIVE,"Cute, Clean, Very Dog friendly. One can not beat the affordability."
NEGATIVE,"This place was a nightmare. We got in super late and the night vlerk was great the trouble started the next morning when I woke up to a dead bed bugs under my neck and a baby one crwaling around on the sheets. The housekeeper confirmed that it was a bed bug. They moved us rooms but only 2 doors down from where we originally were so we had to ask again to be moved to a completely different part of the hotel. The operations manager came to our room to make sure everything was ok and said that he would pay for our drycleaning then when we asked about him paying for it again he said no that it would be to expensive to have everything dry cleaned. He said they had checked the room and didnt find anything, however they did not check it thoroughly and the ""check"" was over in about an hour, where as a real check should take all day. They only comped half of our first night stay and teh front desk girl was a nightmare to deal with. Do Not stay here it is not worth the money or teh headache!!!"
POSITIVE,"just spent a really nice family holiday at seven seas. was very happy to have plenty of space in our 2 queen room to add a rollaway- there are 5 of us(3 teens). the place is spic and span. very near freeway, but we weren't bothered by traffic noise. pleasan staff, super clean pool. nice patio tables around to have a cold drink, snack. you can order from bar or bring your own. we kept cold drinks in our little fridge in the room. loved that fashion valley mall is about a 10 minute walk away. hotel has free parking. easy access to all san diego highlights. ...old town, swap meet, FABULOUS zoo, beaches. we had room 102- on 2nd floor above pool. perfect on site restaurant for breakfast. a small gym. it was such a good deal- expedia.ca. highly recommend."
POSITIVE,Staff was wonderful - went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Room was very clean and comfortable. Great free breakfast. This is an exceptional hotel located in a quaint village in the heart of wine country .
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed our stay, employees were very nice and helpful. The room was clean and the temperature was great. Bathroom was an experience, very loud when flushing the toilet. Breakfast was good, however, did not like paper plates and plastic utensils. Again our stay was very nice."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here in the past for a couple of nights. This stay was for 3 nights. The staff is great, They moved us from the highway side of the unit to the parking lot side without any hassle at all. As previous reviewers have mentioned the property is clean and well kept. If you are looking for a pillow top or similar sleeping surface you will be disappointed. The beds here are very firm. There is a convient truck stop restaurant within a short distance from the entrance. There is pool and fitness room at the property. Room Tip: sleep on the side away from the highway....no road noise"
POSITIVE,Great staff! Extremely helpful. A great hotel location for shopping and sightseeing!
POSITIVE,The hotel is an older hotel but it was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. I read other reviews on this site and knew what I was getting. I would definitely stay there again.
NEUTRAL,I requested for a microwave which wasn't given to me until after 2 hours of wait. Then when I checked out. I was charged a fee for the microwave which I was never told about when I requested it. I had to call back for them to rescind the charge but overall it led to a disappointing experience. The room was a bit tight. Location is great but otherwise there's nothing great about this hotel.
POSITIVE,the hotel was located in a great area it had alot of rooms you can park the car directly infront of ur room the bed was pretty comfy and the service was good front desk were very helpful and polite and the jaccuzi was really nice.
POSITIVE,"We visit San Diego from time to time and now that we know where this Best Western is, we will be staying there again."
POSITIVE,"We wanted a place close to Crater Lake Nat'l Park while traveling on a 2-week vacation in the Pacific NW. This Best Western was all that seemed available. We were not disappointed with the room, staff, breakfast or peaceful surroundings. It was on the high end of our budget but for the location and the quality of what we received, well worth it. Room Tip: No elevator. Take that into consideration stairs are a problem or you have heavy luggage."
POSITIVE,"I didn't spend much time at the hotel. Most of our time was spent at the tasting rooms. But the rooms were large and clean, and the staff was polite and friendly. Great for the price"
POSITIVE,"The indoor heated pool and jacuzzi were the perfect touch for the end of the day! walking distance to pizza, shopping, movies and just off I-5 but quiet. I stayed here with my kids after a day of skiing. It was so nice to be able to walk to the local stores, pizza place, movies, drug store. Very cental. The hot tub/jacuzzi and pool were an added bonus. There's a nice size gym as well with a variety of exercise machines. Plus, you can't beat the breakfast. Perfect place to stay with busy kids. There's a bar and restaurant to boot!"
POSITIVE,"Location/proximately to downtown and major highway. Would prefer a softer bed. But not to imply the bed was bad. Location is great. Close to highway, yet there was no automobile noise. Very close to all the wineries and downtown. Had a great stay at this hotel. The bed was a bit too firm, but I still slept quite well, so no big complaints. Breakfast was great and served on time. Great location. Price was right. I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel. Staff was very nice and room was comfortable and clean. Only downside is that while the rest of the room looks recently updated, the bathroom looked like it did not make the remodel."
NEUTRAL,"Everything was ok, except delay in changing bed clothes or at least dusted them, and lack of basic higienic products refill. My husband went to talk with the manager about that. Location: LOCATION IS PERFECT, CLOSE TO EVERYTHING"
POSITIVE,"Overall, loved it, especially for the price in such a cool place as La Jolla. Great beaches and restaurants are just a short walk away. Parking is $12 at the motel, but you can find free parking on the streets if you have a modicum of patience and luck. Only issue was the air conditioning only works if the temp is above 62 outside temp, so we had to [?] leave our balcony door open at night, which was not a pick problem but often and on with you hear a few night time noises. Would definitely stay there again. La Jolla is magical!"
POSITIVE,"I booked this only to stay the night and get up and go. Gated so your car is safer. It is close to the highway so a plus and minus. I thought the room was very clean and nice. Like others mentioned very close to the old town. Other than that I thought this offered a very good value. Value propisitions are huge. I think some expect a 5 star hotel and they pay 70 dollars. Not going to happen, but his a very good value. Nice touch by Kim to call my room and make sure everything was to my satisfaction."
NEUTRAL,"My wife and two teen children stayed only one night after getting a ground floor room with ripped furniture, nail polish dried on dining room table, and candy wrappers in chairs. I assume this was worst room and other rooms are nicer based on generally positive reviews. Great location is only positive. The pool is relatively small. It has few resort amenities like restaurant, bar, whirlpool, store, spa and ATM. We have stayed at other Ft Myers Beach places and don't understand the rave reviews particularly in light of steep price. Staff was kind enough to let us cancel remainder of reservation without penalty."
POSITIVE,"This is an older hotel, which adds a certain charm to the experience. It is in close proximity to Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom metro stops, as well as walking distance to the National Mall. Staff were friendly and helpful and room was clean and decorated nicely."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here with our two kids for two nights in July. The staff was very helpful at check-in, even though we arrived at a very busy time. Our room was comfortable, spacious and clean. We payed a little extra for an ocean-view room, and had an amazing view from the balcony. I would totally recommend doing this if you can, because it guarantees that you are away from the pool, which can get noisy, and also gives you a view of the pacific. The breakfast was great, and included pastries and bagels, fruit, juice, milk, boiled eggs and two hot entrees. The pool is small, but very nic, and it was great eating brakfast by the pool each morning. It was a short walk to all kinds of shopping, restaurants, the beach and an oceanfront park. We would definitely stay there again. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the pool, or, for an ocean view room for a little extra $."
POSITIVE,Pros: Great transportation provided by hotel! Cons: Nothing around the hotel if you needed a drug store or a restaurant.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is dated but kept very clean and everything works. The rooms are typical of a 70's/80's US Beach Hotel. Only a few good restaurants in walking distance, if you stay here hire a car. Shuckers Bar and Grill which is attached to the Hotel is excellent. Pros: Shuckers Bar and Grill and the pool area over looks the Bay. Cons: Could not get a full Breakfast Location: It's about a 15-20 minute car ride from Down Town Miami and other main attractions."
POSITIVE,"Just a great setup with brilliant accommodation! Set in a relaxed area of Paradise Island and close to the beach, I would recommend this hotel to everyone"
POSITIVE,A bunch of friends and I stayed at this place over a weekend trip. I have to stay we had a great experience. The staff were friendly and approachable and they helped answer all of our questions. Overall great service. The rooms were big and clean and you can tell they maintained this property very well. Excellent value!
POSITIVE,"We walked in-- without a reservation-- after a full day of museum-visiting in Philadelphia, and were greeted by a cordial and very professional staff who had us in a room within minutes. The room was very nice--clean, with comfortable beds, updated bathroom, new mini-fridge and flat screen tv--just right for a short stay. Complimentary breakfast was fresh, varied, and plentiful, including eggs, waffles, pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereal with milk--and great coffee. All in all--a good stay and a fair price."
POSITIVE,"Staff was friendly, especially both front desk clerks we had dealings with"
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,Good location and easy access to the tube. Single room was extremely small and not good value for money.
POSITIVE,"The room I requested was waiting when I arrived. The was pleasant and concerned about providing good service. Breakfast started promptly a 6:00 as advertised, love those waffles, and the expresso was also welcome. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travel, I'll be back."
POSITIVE,"We just stayed one night as we were visiting relatives in the area. Not hard to find but tricky making a left hand turn (coming from the south) as oncoming traffic making left turns at an intersection just after the entrance to the hotel. Check-in was quick. Staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and looked newly renovated. We had a room with a king size bed. The room and bath had plenty of space to put our luggage and move around. Nice flat screen TV, microwave and mini-fridge. Bed was comfortable. Just a note regarding the bedding: the way the beds are made up (to look stylish), a good portion of the blankets and sheets were tucked under at the bottom of the bed, so at first use, there didn't seem to be enough bedding. After I went to the bottom of the bed and un-tucked the blankets, there was plenty. Breakfast was included with selections of hot and cold cereal, pastries (including fresh, iced cinnamon rolls) and bagels, sausage(?) gravy, mixed cut fruit and fresh fruit, and waffle maker for make-your-own waffles. We would definitely stay again and look forward to it. Room Tip: Book early as there are only a few places to stay in area and, if there is an event, the rooms go qu..."
POSITIVE,We have stayed at the Best Western several times this year. It is not bad. The check in time is a little hectic because they don't let people check in a little earlier - so then everyone ends up at the front desk at the same time. Parking isn't that great. We always end up having to park at the farthest end of the parking lot at the hotel - i think [?] it is because most of the spaces are taken up by valet. But for the price and the location it is well worth it. the hotel is clean and in walking distance from Downtown Disney.
POSITIVE,This hotel was in a great location in Orlando. They did a good job with customer service and the room was very comfortable. My only critique is the fitness room was not that great. There was no water jug set up and the equipment was not in the best/working shape.
POSITIVE,"It was a decent hotel and definitely worth the price. It was clean and provided all we needed for a one night stay.Pros: The shuttle service was helpful since we did not have a car. The breakfast was nice to help reduce our spending. Cons: The breakfast area was entirely too small and many guests, including myself, had to eat breakfast on our laps."
POSITIVE,The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Perfectly located in central Boulder, (not far from the CU campus) and easy to find off the main highway. Walking distance to all that you need, and located on the main bus route for a easy get around. They serve a no charge continental breakfast, till 10:00, so you do not have to get up early for your meal. This is important because they have nice soft pillows (which you can purchase for only $15) and very comfy beds. There are a lot of food options available for the breakfast, and polite staff to assist you. They cook your waffle for you! The staff definately went out of their way to accomodate our requests with a pleasant attitude. This is the third time that I have stayed at this hotel and this is the third time that I am glad that I stayed at this hotel. This is not a five star award winning formula hotel, with elegance and beautiful decor. But it does the job perfectly for my family. Next time I need to go to Boulder, I will stay at the Golden Buff, it is Good Stuff!"
NEUTRAL,We stayed there for a weekend earlier this summer. The room was large and appeared nice however it didn't seem very clean. When we walked in the first thing we noticed was the smell of dirty feet. This smell was evident throughout our stay. Overall it's a basic Best Western. Nothing all that exciting about the place. It is average. But the smell made us feel uncomfortable. I did send an email about our thoughts but did not hear back from anyone. I highly doubt we would return to this particular Best Western. It's too bad because typcially we have enjoyed all of our stays in this area. Maybe it was just one bad one?
POSITIVE,"Staff knowledgable, room was ready, very clean. Night was quiet and without any problems. I plan on staying here on my next trip. ken"
NEUTRAL,"If you want to be in downtown Gettysburg, this is a good location. However, the beds are not great and the pillows are the fake feather type. The bathroom is ok but the constantly running fan when light is on was loud and annoying. Ok for a couple nights but not a long stay."
POSITIVE,Had a great overnight stay. The room was very clean and well kept. The public areas were just as nice. Will definitely stay there again next time we go to Grove City.
POSITIVE,"Good value for the money, especially at a Best Western. Excellent Breakfast & very pet friendly."
NEUTRAL,"This recently refurbished hotel is near the Newark Airport - and is primarily used as a one-nighter for people who must spread flights across two days, or for those who want an inexpensive jump-off point to NYC. The rooms are large, with flat screens, WIFI, safes, etc... just what you'd expect. The staff is friendly, and the shuttles were on time. (On-time is important if you have a flight to catch!!) The breakfast, which is included, was acceptable. All in all, this is just what you would expect for a northern Joisey hotel that caters to one nighters. All you wanted was something reasonably priced, clean, and convenient to the airport and NYC, right? By the way - the elevator is slow. Try to get a lower floor. Also, if you are unfamiliar with how to find hotel shuttles at the airport, research it before you arrive!!"
NEUTRAL,I stayed at this hotel because they had one of the best park & fly rates near the Newark Airport. The room was very good....but...the walls of this hotel were either paper thin or the people next to my room were very loud. I could hear everything they said until about midnight and then I heard them again around 4:00 AM. Not great to only get four hours sleep before you 8:00 AM flight. I thought of calling down to the desk to have someone come up and tell them to turn down the volume but I couldn't be sure when I ducked my head out in the hall whether the sound was coming from the room next to me or the room across the hall. It says something bad for our civiilization when people can't be civilized in a hotel setting. They just talk at their normal decibel level and have no consideration at others. Getting back to the hotel via the shuttle once my plane arrived took much longer than the standard 15 minutes that they tell everyone. It was more like a half hour...or perhaps more. I guess the big question is: would I stay here again if I had to do a park and fly. Based upon my review and the other ones I am looking at...probably not
POSITIVE,Living close by I recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends. They have all been very complimentary. Enjoyed their stay. Staff have been extremely helpful. food - fantastic
NEGATIVE,There simply was no service. The Wi-Fi was bad at best and the clek at the counter instructed me to call an 800 number whrn I inquired Doors stuck and were difficult to open and close. The restaurant was primarily aa bar and it was hard to get waited on.
POSITIVE,I would most definetely stay here again. The hotel is a few miles off the Intersate. The hotel was very clean and the staff were all very friendly.
POSITIVE,"Got a great deal on Hotels.com. Cheapest hotel with high customer ratings. We were also very satisfied with our stay. Accommodating staff with very clean and private rooms. We were directly beside the breakfast diner and didn't hear any noise due to guests or the dining staff at breakfast. Food is what you would expect, good variety of typical breakfast [?] foods and tasted fine. Check in/out was smooth and painless. Again rooms were kept very nicely and bathroom is very roomy and adorned nicely with tiled walls, floor, and marbled countertops. Great place to stay for a low price. I'd stay there again if I needed to."
NEUTRAL,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with my husband and 20 month old daughter. The staff was very nice and the room was clean. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and jacuzzi in the living room, so it was plenty big. We ordered room service from the restaurant and the food was okay but overpriced. Breakfast was a buffet and was pretty standard. The location on the lake is very nice and right next to the highway. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others planning to stay in Moses Lake for a night or two. One problem is that there was no elevator, so carrying all our stuff to the second floor was difficult."
NEGATIVE,"Staff was friendly and courteous. However, we had an issue at checkout that required speaking to manager. Well, after his rants and threats, he hung up on my wife,called back to front desk and threatened his desk clerk. Steer clear of this place. It is starting to get a little run down and management is terrible. TWO THUMBS DOWN!"
POSITIVE,"Best Western has surprised me more than once. The hotel is very comfortable and they seem to be improving their accommodation as we travel the country. It's value for the money, but short of being the best in the class."
NEUTRAL,Hotel is good enough but you cannot go anywhere by walking. It is far away from touristic area.
POSITIVE,My husband and I stayed here last month after having a very bad experience at another hotel in Boulder. We love this hotel because of the people working there and all the small things add up. They have a great breakfast and large quite rooms. They are always very flexible with our needs and make us feel at home. The only con is this is a very old hotel and the rooms open to the outside so security is always in the back of our minds but have never had a problem with it. They keep the rooms very clean especially the bathrooms! We visit our son at CU any chance we get so we are in Boulder often. We will definitely learn from our mistake and stay here on our next trip. (The Holiday Inn in town is nice too but we like the location here better.) Room Tip: The back rooms are the most nice and quite.
NEUTRAL,"Location was close to disney downtown. Not able to connect to wi-fi, front desk unable to help & sent me to call tech support. Tech was also unable to solve issue, was never able to connect. Rooms are small and tv is outdated."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is TERRIBLE, VERY BAD SMELL ALL AROUND that's what I noticed when We First came in. My Kids Would'nt go swimming cause the pool area looked very dirty. They should start renovation the entire hotel... WE WON'T GO BACK. The only thing we appreciate was the sjuttle to the PNC park."
POSITIVE,"We visit Saint Louis often, and the Best Western Saint Louis Inn is our ""Home Away from Home"". Convenient to the highways, but far enough away to be very quiet and peaceful. Great Breakfast, and the ""Cracker Barrel"" is a few steps away. Great value for the money! Room Tip: Choose room on top floor for away from Lobby for max quiet (there are three floors)."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is very conveniently located,close to the site of the Shakespere Festival.Walking back from the show at near midnight is safe.Overall the hotel is a great choice."
NEUTRAL,"We found the hotel to be clean, modern and efficient. Parking was OK, the room neat and clean with a friendly staff. We had breakfast which featured fresh fruit, assorted pastries and donuts, bagels and bread as well as cereals, yogurt and juices. All looked good and you've seen this selection nearly everywhere. However, I have never seen grey scrambled eggs and grey bacon before. When I mentioned to the attendant that the eggs were disgusting, he replied that they were overcooked, and the bacon was just there. On the other hand, soon the offensive eggs were removed and replaced with fresh and a nice lady brought me a plate of salty crispy bacon. There was too much that was iffy to make me comfortable at breakfast."
POSITIVE,Staff was consistently friendly and helpful. The location was convenient to all of the places we wanted to visit and there were numerous places to eat within a very short distance. The breakfast was nice and hot every day. We will definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"I suspect you, like, I would rather stay at an older hotel that is managed meticulously, than a newer hotel that has is not. Fireside in is definitely the former. Built in the 60s with the current rooms built in 1985, it makes up in attention to detail for what it lacks in modernity. Among the things I loved about this include: the location is terrific, across the road from beautiful Moonstone Beach; the front staff was pleasant and attentive; rooms were meticulously clean; the in-room fireplace was cozy on a cold evening; in-room WiFi worked well; the pool was clean and big enough to do laps; and, unlike the fruit offered in many hotel serve-yourwself breakfasts, the fruit was fresh, excellent quality and delicious. Room Tip: Some rooms have a patio. If the weather is good, I suspect the room with a patio would be enjoyed."
POSITIVE,"We arrived just after 3 pm check in time so we had to wait a little to get our key. Everything was close...our room was next door to the office, the breakfast room, pool and jacuzzi were maybe 100 feet away. Highway 1 ran behind the motel but we heard nothing. On check in we were given some fresh baked cookies and breakfast was included in the price. The room was a nice size and had a comfortable king size bed. We were very pleased, especially since we were offered a $50 discount for a cyber Monday online reservation. There was a problem with our room when we checked in. One of the staff was working on the fireplace but with no success. We were moved to another room even larger with apologies for any inconvenience. One funny thing about the pricing...there is no charge for a child stay with a paid adult, but a pet is charged $20 extra."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel provides a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. However, you need to call for it. And even after you call for it, it can take them 45 minutes to come pick you up, even though it's just a 5 minute drive away. The entrance doesn't look promising. The rooms are okay, but there was a couple fighting next door and the hotel security was trying to handle it. Even after the door was shut, I could still hear the couple shouting at each other. The hotel felt dated. Breakfast was slowly prepared. And rather oily for a standard American style breakfast. You can use their computer to print out boarding passes, but you have to do it standing up. Saving grace is that the front desk staff are really nice and helpful. And they have thoughtful things like a list of buses that you can take to Waikiki. But beware, the wait for the buses can be long and the ride can take 1-1.5 hours into the city."
NEGATIVE,"This is the first bad review of a hotel I've ever written, but we had SUCH a bad experience, I am writing to warn others not to waste their time. First, this is a drive-up motel-style hotel, which isn't exactly clear from their website. When we went to check into our room, the woman at the counter was rude to the person in front of us and acted like we were a nuisance as well. I wish I could remember her name, but our trip was several months ago. As soon as we walked out of the office, I spoke to my husband and told him I wanted to find somewhere else. However, it was late in the evening, we'd been traveling all day, so we decided to check out our room instead. In our room, one wall was a sliding glass door leading out to the pool, so if we wanted any natural light in the room, we would have no privacy (there were many people at the pool). I went to turn on the light in our room, and the shade wasn't screwed on. Plus, the lightbulb was broken. I went to use the restroom, and the toilet seat was wet. I decided to call the office about the lightbulb in our room. Here's how the conversation went. ""Front desk."" (spoken very harshly, as if I was a nuisance again.) I'm used to people answering the phone with their name, so I said, ""Who am I speaking with please?"" ""The front desk."" (again, very rudely spoken) ""And what is your name, please?"" By the time she told me her name, I'd had enough of this horrible hotel. I politely ended the call, grabbed my bags, and told my husband we were just going to have to find somewhere else. Even though it was 7 o'clock, there was no way I was going to support this hotel in any way with my money. When we checked out of the room, after telling her all of the problems in the room and our dissatisfaction with the service, she had the nerve to tell us we might not get our money back. I would have been all to happy to speak to her manager if they had billed us (which they did not), but what kind of person would hire someone that rude to be the representative of their hotel? We ended up staying at the Hilton Sonoma Hotel, which was absolute heaven! Yes, it was more expensive, but after this horrible experience, we were ready to be pampered. Room Tip: Go elsewhere!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 days, and were really surprised for the size of the room, equipped with a kitchenette. Well, we must admit that we're europeans and we're not used to this kind of rooms... We enjoyed our staying a lot. The room was very clean, the staff very helpful and the breakfast had a good variety of food. It is about 20 minutes walking distance from the Parliament Hill, maybe a little far from the downtown, but the neighbourhood is quiet and safe."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel was very average. The room was clean but smelled very musky and moldy when we walked in and the front desk girl was very snippy and rude. We also witnessed her being rude to other hotel guests. Also, the rooms only have one outlet near the desk. There are no other free outlets in the room except the bathroom. The free breakfast was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. All in all, if you don't have a run-in with front desk, a cheap choice."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Cleanliness, friendly desk clerk, and nice place."
NEUTRAL,"We were at the So Burlington Windjammer inn for a short night en-route to the nearby airport. Location was fine (close to the airport which we wanted for a 6am flight out - otherwise not very scenic), room was ok if a bit small. The hotel was clean, etc. But the real problem was the A/C: whereas hotel A/C are usually noisy, this one was extremely noisy."
POSITIVE,"It's winter in Ohio which means it's bound to snow, but it had been more than a day since the snow had fallen making the lot just full of slush and snow. Even the drop-off area was difficult terrain. Aside from that, everything else about the stay was great. The staff was all friendly. The place was well-maintained. The room was comfortable and nicely decorated and arranged."
POSITIVE,"We has been an excellent stay, the hotel installations and staff are the best. Jeff Kerrigan or christina, we are Mexicans on Saturday October 8 2011. Could you please contact on my mail? Muchisimas gracias (bem@hycelco.com, romelix1@gmail.com). Room Tip: check the transportation at time See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This is a lovely property located in a great area. Excellent Front Desk staff, very friendly and helpful. They rent bikes with helmets/locks and you can go off for a bike ride for a few hours or all day. On a major bus route from LAX approx 40 minute ride where you can easily transfer to other buses to Santa Monica and more. You can also get to Long Beach and Anaheim going the other direction on the same mainline bus approx a 20 minute ride. Riviera Village is a great shopping area with many restaurant and cafe choices. You can shop for many items including a good selection of wines at Trader Joe's. Ask for Mike...he is very knowledgeable in the wine department! We scouted out the area and decided that being a 2 block walk from the beach is better than being right on the beach where you don't have much privacy due to the esplanade where many people walk and the Strand which is a 22 mile long bike path that covers the 5 county beaches of LA. The only thing missing from this hotel is real coffee mugs! I can't drink coffee and/or tea from those paper cups. A complimentary hot breakfast is served daily and you can also enjoy cocktails during the evening in the lobby. Would we stay here again....most definitely. Room Tip: take 3rd floor facing the pool gardens - with a sliding door to balcony."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. Clean, comfortable, nice staff. Good breakfast. Will stay here again if I am ever in Wainwright!"
POSITIVE,"The Best Western in Roanoke, Texas exceeded my expectations. I was familiar with Roanoke and new that this was a safe location, but was not sure about the hotel because of the low price. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and quality of the room. The only problem, which I never said anything about was that the bed was quite hard. The service was so good, theyprobably would have changed out the bed had I asked. I would definitely stay there again. ...Pros: This hotel was clean and they had very efficient service. Cons: The bed was too hard."
POSITIVE,"This was one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The front desk clerk was very pleasant, the room was spacious and modern, breakfast was better than average, and the check-out clerk was polite. The cleaning lady left extra soaps and towels like we asked and the room was very clean. The location was awesome. 5 minutes from downtown Buffalo and 10 minutes from the footballstadium. The only bad things were there was virtually no water pressure in the shower and the water didn't get very hot. But it still gets two enthusiastic thumbs up for this hotel. ...Cons: The staff was super nice."
POSITIVE,"The hotel restaurant was excellent. Staff was very friendly and decor was nice. Good location that is far enough from Pier 39 but good proximity to transportation and many attractions (North Beach, China Town, Fisherman's Wharf, Embarcadero). I would stay here again. Our room was tiny."
NEUTRAL,Very well located and good value for money. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this property twice. We have never been disappointed - and we are VERY picky travelers. The hotel is beautiful and so clean. The staff was very friendly on each of our visits. The restaurant is fabulous as well. Our daughter had surgery that day, so we ordered room service and the food and service were spectacular. I highly recommend the Best Western Premier Nicollet Inn."
POSITIVE,I was pleased with the service that I received. The bed was a little firm but besides that... front desk was at my door within five minutes if I needed anything. The housekeepers waited as long as I needed to get ready before they came in. For the price you can't beat the service. Anyone that complains must be used to a 5 star.
NEUTRAL,"I've come here a couple times now, and both times, the staff has started cleaning up breakfast 30 minutes early starting with the waffle batter (leaving only cold cereal and cheap donuts to choose from). Both times she claimed they were out of batter. I believed her the first time. But the second time I realized there must be plenty of batter in the kitchen and that she's just too lazy to refill it. I travel a lot, and I'm a loyal Best Western customer because of the free breakfast. I set my alarm and wake up earlier than I normally would to guarantee I'll make it to breakfast in time. This woman's laziness has ensured I'll never return here. Plus the water tastes bad. Too bad because the rooms are clean and most of the staff are true professionals, being consistently courteous and helpful. Plus there's this beautiful redhead who works the counter in the evening and likes to read silly comics. I have nice little crush on her. Liked: Rooms, Redhead Disliked: Continental breakfast, Cable"
POSITIVE,If you want people to do surveys they must be short and not have reuirements like this. I will not do another because of this.
POSITIVE,"The hotel and room were in good condition. Service was friendly and helpful. When we had a problem with our bill the manager quickly fixed it. The price was a bit steep considering the location and style of the hotel, I think that charging $10/extra person and then $20 for our cat was a bit steep. However, the location accepted pets, was clean, had courteous staff and was 5 minutes from where I needed to be in Ottawa. My parents plan on staying there again when they come to visit."
POSITIVE,This is a decent choice for a value motel in a decent location in town. I'd stay there again assuming there are no nicer choices available. Staff was friendly and helpful
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here many times and the staff are so friendly and courteous, they really look after you. The rooms in the new tower are very nice and up to date, but more importantly they are very clean. We have stayed there about 7 times and the complimentary breakfast they put on is exceptional, your choice of bacon or sausage and eggs with a breakfast buffet that is very nice. This is a place I would stay in compared to edmonton hotels, the drive is worth it. Room Tip: rooms in the new tower are very nice, older part is outdated and dingy."
POSITIVE,"Just a basic hotel - nothing overly special in terms of the room. The bed is very comfortable and the staff were super friendly - especially the breakfast staff in the restaurant. The shuttle drivers definitely need a lesson in customer service. I enjoyed seeing the look on their faces when I didn't tip them. They need to realize that a tip has to be earned!! In the hotel's defense, the contract out the shuttle service in conjunction with several other hotels in the area."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here on the way to Hearst Castle from SF. Very comfortable, quiete, clean. Staff is very nice, they even send us a letter that they found my son's book in the room and will return it. That was nice!"
POSITIVE,"I had a great stay. The hotel is clean, the hotel offers several perks, and it's nice and quiet. Perfect if you have work that needs to get done when you're in town."
NEUTRAL,Not bad for the price. Very friendly staff. Close to the California adventure side of the park so walking distance to the park was totally doable. Free parking and wifi. I would stay here again.
NEUTRAL,I don't really have any complaint except that we thought that the room was really small for the price!!
POSITIVE,"This property provides a great escape from both the highway and high prices at other local hotels that provide comparable service and accommodations. This is my second stay at a Best Western property, and what I have found has been surprisingly clean, fresh, and well maintained. The front desk was warm and welcoming when I arrived, I had asked for a ground floor room and that was delivered. The corridors are bright, well lit, and clean. The room was clean, and sufficient. The rooms are a little on the small side, but not uncomfortably so. I made use of the hotel's laundry room, and everything was in working order and reasonably priced. The price paid for this hotel was half of what I paid recently at another property in the area, and the quality, service, and rooms were comparable - providing a much better value. The linens were fresh and clean. The bed was comfortable, and the room temperature was very easy to maintain. The bath is split with the sink in the main room. This hotel provides the same value as a property with outdoor entry , but with the safety and convenience of indoor corridors. Safe, clean, comfortable, and affordable - you really can't ask for much more than that! I would definitely stay at this property again. Room Tip: I would stick to the ground floor! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"I went to visit friends that were staying at Rogers Rock camp ground and I don't do tents. I stayed here for one night, it was clean and fairly reasonably priced I would recommend it. It was easy to find and centrally located in a town that doesn't have much"
POSITIVE,"The hotel staff seemed to be focused on the large group parties they had in the hotel, individuals not so much. We were never asked if we had an enjoyable stay or if there was anything they could do for us. In fact they never acknowledged our presence! The rooms are small. The plumbing fixtures out of date, the sink drained slowly, the faucet on the [?] wet bar dripped heavily, the bathtub had been resurfaced and was peeling. It was clean and warm with good parking and nearby restaurants. The fireplace was a natural wood fireplace which we did not use because of inconvenience and dust and smell near the sleeping area. At breakfast they ran out of fruit 7.30 and did not replenish the supply. It was crowded with large groups who swarmed the breakfast area and the lobby at peak times. It served our purposes but I would not use it again or recommend it to others."
POSITIVE,The staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean and quiet. Great place to stay when visiting the Casino. Limo ride took just a few minutes
POSITIVE,"We were there for the Brickyard400 during the last weekend of July. Based upon my dearest friend's recommendation, I booked Best Western Crossroads because he felt this hotel would definitely be better than the one I stayed at last year. We were pleasantly surprisedeverything was better. The front desk attendant, Debbie, was fabulous. She was so helpful, friendly, courteous, all round so very pleasantshe was our first contact with the Best Western and I can see why they have the word ""Best""..she was..period. The room was very nice, better than I had expected. We usually stay in 4 or 5 star hotels and our penthouse accommodations aboard our cruises have raised our bar of expectations. This hotel's room was very very nice. I was not happy with the smell of smoke down the room hallways. We were booked into a non-smoking room but it basically didn't matter because the smell of smoke wafted into our room anyway. I would comment on as not well taken care of was the ""tub-surround"". There was visible mold in the certain areas. Heynothing that a spray of bleach couldn't handle. The room staff were quiet, demure and friendly as well. The pool was wonnnnderful. Sure, we could see the vehicular traffic beyond the wrought iron fence but heywe were in a pool and they were sweating in their carswe win!! lol Most times, we had the pool to ourselvesfantastic. We enjoyed 90+ degree temps at 9 p.m.what was the rest of the world doing? We were enjoying the Best Western. Yes, I would recommend this location. Slight detour off the main freeway I-70 but well worth it. We are coming back next yearyou hear that, Debbie.see you next year!!"
NEGATIVE,"My father stayed in this hotel used a bestwestern hotel card which was used to pay for the rom..he has his receipt..8 days later they go and charge a night to his credit card...3 phone calls later he gets the woman in charge of billing she refuses to give his money back till she is contacted by his credit card company...she tried saying to him he stayed the next night when he was actually at a different bestwestern in Pacifica...I called her today and told her to return the money she said the same thing to me I said your returning it now,,it is theft, she starts laughing thinking this is funny...I said you stole from my dads card...and return it now...she hung up on me..this hotel is disgusting and to think this is humorous is mind bogging...my dad is a platinum member with bestwestern because I give him bestwestern cards meaning over 1200 a year and this is how he gets treated.... Room Tip: Don't give your credit card information to this hotel"
POSITIVE,"First, book this place. I stumbled across this hotel while researching a trip from SFO to SEA. We targeted Eureka as a launching stop to explore Humboldt State Park & Redwood National Park. From the moment I walked in the door, this hotel delivered - from customer service, to the room, to all the amenities. Now, let me be clear, we stayed in six different hotels for this trip. Some of them boutique/luxury and some ""average joe."" I can confidently say this Best Western out did them all. Sure it's not swanky and stylish. Yes, it doesn't have staff members in chic uniforms. The decor is functional and not fashionable. But style isn't everything - you can't out style bad service and dirty rooms (which we experienced at the boutique properties). So, I am giving this place 5 stars because they absolutely give you as much as possible for what they have to offer. Here are some observations from our stay and why I was humbled because I'm not going to lie - I'm a snob and I was apprehensive about booking a Best Western (shame on me): -- we booked a garden room which looks out into a beautiful interior courtyard area with koi pond and hot tub. I was concerned our room might be noisy since we were close to the hot tub but that was not an issue. I would recommend a garden room as I would imagine street noise with those loud motorcycles may be an issue (just a guess) -- our room was spotless! The bathroom was so clean it shined... I love that! Seriously, the housekeeping on the property is on it. Never saw a piece of trash on the ground, the room was immaculate and they keep pace with the morning breakfast area keeping it clean and tidy for everyone to enjoy. -- the garden room was large with a giant dressing area with sink and the shower and toilet area being separate. Plenty of space to stretch out. The bed was comfy too... better than expected linens that were a nice touch. -- there is a full breakfast in the lobby which was included in our rate. All the usual suspects - eggs, waffles, cereal, etc. It changed daily and was more than adequate. -- there was a nice surprise in the morning in the garden room area. They set up coffee, tea, pastries, yogurt and fruit + newspapers. Plenty for a quick and easy breakfast without going to the lobby. And, there are six types of coffee to chose from instead of the usual decaf or caf. IMO, this was a nice touch and demonstrates how tuned in they are to the guest experience. -- there are onsite laundry facilities. Not a big deal for most but since we were hiking for the time we were there, it allowed us to wash our dirty hiking clothes so we didn't have to pack them or try to find a dodgy laundry facility off property. The laundry area was clean, easily accessed and had self-vend machines for single use detergent and fabric softener. Again, so convenient and a real treat to do a load of laundry steps from our room when we were dead tired. I can't say enough nice things about our stay. I was truly impressed and wished I could have packed this hotel and taken it with us for our trip. It was a reminder that a back to basics attitude without any of the stylized pomp and circumstance works. Function does beat fashion. Kudos to each staff member who smiled at us, greeted us, checked us in and out and really added a genuine feel to the property. A training school should be set up here so other hotel property owners can learn a few of the basics to customer service. Thanks for a great stay and I know you must listen to your customers - it shows in how you run this property! Room Tip: Book a garden room! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"For such a reasonable rate we didn't expect all we got. Spacious room (2 very comfortable Queen beds), microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker, free wifi, nice toiletries, clean, quiet, resort-like layout of buildings, good breakfast, coffee & tea always available in lobby and tasty 'welcome' chocolate chip cookies. Couldn't have been better! Didn't use pool or hot tub but they looked nice."
POSITIVE,"stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and it was alright, the beds are comfortable, good size rooms, it was cleaned everyday. the only down fault was that our room faced international drive and it was too noisy at night and morning. The breakfast is very good from hard boiled eggs to mickey shaped wafels and cereals and of course local oranges, it was goodÂ enough and always plenty. if I;m in the area again i would definetly stay again."
POSITIVE,really parking fees? and some kind of service charge
POSITIVE,"I spent a weekend at Joshua Tree and spent a night here. The staff is very friendly, the room is very spacious, and comes with free breakfast with good options and high speed internet. Turning on the shower was difficult (there's a ring on the bottom faucet you have to pull down), but did not retract from experience once we got it figured out."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here on a long road trip for a family emergency. The room was clean and the beds were OK. They didn't have the room we wanted, but we stayed here anyway. I was glad to get away early the next day."
POSITIVE,I walked in the room and felt like I was at home.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is manages very well ! My trip was strictly business ......but would stay there for pleasure. Very personable manager and employees.....You were treated as if you were staying at the"" Ritz or The Plaza."""
NEGATIVE,"My wife and I awoke with painful bed bug bites just after staying at this hotel. We are sure that the bites came from the Colonial Inn, because we were at home the night before and at Disney World the night after. Disney sent pest control and even bug sniffing dogs to our room to be sure the bites hadn't come from their property. They were 100% sure that no bugs were found. We received no other bites during our week-long stay. When I addressed this with Best Western customer service, the general manager of the Colonial Inn replied that they had inspected the room and found no bugs. This simply can't be true. I'm very disappointed in Best Western, I have always enjoyed their properties and will definitely reconsider staying at a BW based on this deliberate deception by the general manager. I highly recommend reconsidering your stay at this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Nothing to complain about here! The cell service is abysmal, but the hotel cannot help that! The valet (Odilio) was awesome and very informative about restaurants, attractions and traffic. :) Free valet was very nice! The breakfast left just a bit to be desired, but worked out for us overall. Our room was clean and well taken care of. The TV channels could have been better, but you should really be out seeing the sights anyway. :) It is close to CVS and Target if you need to get groceries/snacks and close to the highway to get everywhere else. Bottom line - I would stay there again. :)"
POSITIVE,"I'm not a person who is super picky and I realized that this was a 2 1/2 star hotel when we booked it. The rooms could have been a little cleaner...especially in the bathroom and, although they were actually clean, the sheets on the bed were stained so bad that I questioned their cleanliness. We were told that we would be compensated for the lack of swimming pool beingfunctional. The staff called our room and apologized and offered Best Western Rewards points and enrollment. Upon checkout, there was no sign that that conversation had even happened. Great Breakfast buffet! Very kind staff. ...Pros: The hotel was in a convenient location for our activities. Cons: The main reason we booked this hotel was for the heated pool. When we got there the pool was covered and empty. Hot tub was not hot either!."
NEGATIVE,"We spent about ten minutes in this Hotel the bathroom was not clean, it looked like the carpet was being replaced but that still is not a good reason for exposed nails no Elavator. we did not spend anymore time then we needed in the hotel we got our stuff [] and picked a cleaner and more suitable place to stay"
POSITIVE,"My partner and I stayed one night at the Best Western Plus University Park Inn & Suites while traveling to visit family during the holidays. We stopped here because it was just a few minutes off of Route 80. Upon arriving, we were greeted by an incredibly cheerful and helpful desk attendant (Elizabeth), who not only told us about the hotel services [?] but also was able to give us good recommendations for restaurants in town--they weren't generic recommendations, either. She asked what kind of food we liked, what mood (bar, quiet, etc.) we were in for the evening, etc. Very accommodating. Our room was spotless, including the bathroom. The heat worked perfectly (and was easy to control/program). The TV had good, clear cable channels. The Wi-Fi was strong and free. The room included a small refrigerator and coffee machine. We also used both the pool and the jacuzzi. Given that there was light freezing rain coming down outside, being in a heated indoor pool was quite a treat. In the morning, the breakfast was great. A huge selection: waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, muffins, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, coffee, juices...all included in the price of the room. Overall, a great place to stay. Two caveats: (1) The hotel is near State College, and given that it was the holidays, the hotel was nearly empty. Hopefully the services, cleanliness, etc., would be just as good during busier periods. (2) The hotel rooms are not terribly sound-proof. Although we did not have any trouble sleeping, we could occasionally here someone talking loudly on a phone in an adjacent room. Overall, not a problem, but something to prevent a perfect 100% score."
NEGATIVE,"First I would like to say, Owner/Mgr, Ravi is very nice and is on top of things when he is there, usually mornings. The staff is friendly. This hotel is quite new but the rooms are worn. The furniture is gouged and scratched. The same with the walls. Our couch had stains, and there were burns on the carpet and bed spread. The microwave had a big dent on top, when I heated food in it noticed that you could see right into it. It was a hole, not a dent. Scary and dangerous! The room decor is very busy and not at all soothing. We were greeted with a dirty washcloth in the sink. The termostat read 73, but our room was cold. The heat came on for maybe 10 minuted during our entire stay. Window seals are broken. There was no remote, asked for one, finally got it ourselves. It didn't work. Water pressure is weak on the 3rd floor. Front entrance is far from parking. This hotel is not in a good area. Every stay I heard police sirens during the night. Breakfast is just OK, coffee urns were empty. They need a breakfast person in the am to stay on top of things.Ravi does this when he is there. Staying at the Hampton Inn next trip."
POSITIVE,"Clean, WELL-LIT rooms with comfortable mattress on bed (firm but not stiff). Adequate healthy breakfast offerings. Friendly staff, well-maintained grounds, and convenient to Payson without being exposed to brunt of the city's traffic. Fitness room equipment is a bit skimpy and the workout area is small, but the adjacent neighborhood offers a decent place to walk."
POSITIVE,"Clean, rooms, comfortable beds.Stayed several nights. Staff was courteous & promptly answered any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"I don't know of any hotel that could possibly compete with this hotel. The rooms are spacious, the staff are the most courteous people I have ever dealt with. The treat you like you are the only guest they have. I have had the pleasure to meet and make my reservations with Bill. Such a gentleman. He is a fine representative for this establishment. If you want the best, stay at the Best Western Luxbury Inn in Fort Wayne Indiana."
POSITIVE,"After a long time, we hreard hearty and friendly conversations between a first-time guest and the registration/reception staff at a motel"
POSITIVE,Just was to far away from were we needed to be in town but was a very good stay.
POSITIVE,"Used this hotel as a home base for several days while visiting and attending concerts in SF, Saratoga, San Jose and Santa Cruz. Hotel has great amenities, excellent beds, pillows etc. The breakfast is good, with a variety of options. Can recommend this property to anyone travelling in the region."
NEUTRAL,"We recently traveled to Edmonton with our two children for spring break. We booked this hotel on Expedia and it was a mystery location -once confirmed we found out which hotel we would be staying at. I then called the hotel to confirm and was informed that on trip-advisor there were a number of bad reviews and then I was assured by the woman on the phone that the hotel has been making improvments to correct any issues. Until I was informed about the reviews by the receptionist I had no concerns about where we would be staying but after hearing this news from her I decided to look up the reviews. I must say I was quite concerned by what I read and I was also quite uneasy about staying at this hotel. When we arrived the hotel presented quite nicely and once in our room I was happy to see a clean comfortable room. Everything did seem a little outdated, the toilets were a slight issue to flush but if you held down the handle it worked fine, and the beds were very comfortable. We did not spend much time at the hotel as we were busy with the kids taking in Edmonton and the mall. This hotel is nice and close to the Mall and many restaurants. All in all we had a nice time at this hotel, I would however suggest that the receptionist should not inform people of the bad reviews unless people inquire about them. Pros: Nice and close to West Edmonton Mall Cons: The pool was a salt water pool but there was ALLOT of salt in the water, way too much! Location: We are from British Columbia"
POSITIVE,"The staff was incredible and made us feel so welcome. The room was beautiful, and it reminded me of much more expensive hotels."
POSITIVE,"the location and the facilities -great breakfast, Parking fees and no elevator to access parking lot."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed at the Best Western Plus Rockville in early Oct. for a conference for about 1/2 the price of the hotel that was hosting the conference. If you need to save money and need to stay in the Rockville / Bethesday area on business, consider this hotel. But find someplace else to have breakfast (the buffet they supply is horrid and they kept running out of coffee. Imagine that, people like to drink coffee in the morning... who woulda thunk it?). The room was small, old and not particularly sparkling clean. Again, the only good thing I can say about the Best Western Plus Rockville is that it is priced much lower than competitive chains."
NEUTRAL,"Value for money was good, the room was clean and comfortable, the personal was friendly and quick to react to my queries. The Internet connection wasn't working on the 9th floor where I had my room. It was fairly noisy, one could hear the people come in and go out of their rooms. The breakfast was the least impressive I had so far, purely functional, no fresh vegetables, as I said, functional...I Could survive with the milk and cornflakes."
NEUTRAL,"Nice room and very close to San Diego Trolley station even blue or orange line. Breakfast is very simple and no protein available. Bar & Grill restaurant at downstairs is okay but a little bit too expensive. Quite far if you want to go shopping in Horton Mall Downtown but if you want to go to Fashion Valley Mall you can walk down to little Italy blue line station. If your destination is the convention center, you can walk for 5-8 minutes up to America Plaza trolley station and catch the orange line to seaport village. Overall, I quite like this hotel. Beds are a little bit too soft and made me have a backache."
NEUTRAL,The location It was disgusting! I had flee bites!!! Room smelt bad! It felt like I am sleeping in motel!! Not again.
POSITIVE,"I am ranking this a 4 because of the location and service. It is not a true four star hotel, but I would highly recommend it and would stay there when visiting Carmel. Free parking in a great location in the heart of Carmel. Everything an easy walk and JD (hotel manager) was so helpful. You never know what you get with a Best Western. This one was a good one. We had a two room suite which was perfect for us, traveling with parents. The smaller room had a nicer bath and two twin beds. The bigger room had a comfy king. Our room was right by the office which was convenient for the breakfast. As noted the breakfast area was small, so we just brought it back to our room. Rooms appeared to be recently renovated. What I also appreciated was the non-stop efforts of the maintentance team. They were constantly about, cleaning, watering plants and seemed to truly care about the property. You don't see that all that much anymore."
NEUTRAL,"Checkin was fine and we were given a ground floor room. Parking was a bit tight, room was fine and a reasonable size although closet and bathroom were pretty cramped. Closet would also have benefited from a light. Breakfast was pretty limited and not too healthy so we skipped it. Coffee was available in the room which also had a fridge. Wifi and Lan access were fine. Price was on the high side for Friday and Saturday but was about half the price on Sunday. Would probably stay here again if price was better."
POSITIVE,"This was a wonderful hotel, with great access to NYC."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel was a three star rating on orbitz, but had 4.2/5 for customer reviews. Best Western I had thought, prior to staying here, has a basic standard of quality, which I expected this hotel to exceed. Not only did it disappoint, but it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The conditions were a bit shabby, but what was really upsetting was that the bed was rock-hard. I thought that perhaps they had put two boxsprings together, and forgotten the mattress. The worst night of sleep I have ever gotten. And I had to pay for the priviledge! This hotel allows dogs, and I had my little boston terrier with me. Upon leaving, I passed the housekeeping supervisor on the stairs, and she cast a disdainful look at my dog carrier and demanded, chiding ""UGH! Which room did you come out of???"" Terrible experience. I will never stay there again, and my faith in what I thought was a chain of hotels with some basic standard, is very diminished."
POSITIVE,"Located close to interstate able o do shopping close by. Within 5 miles of conference center.Pros: The full hot breakfast money saving on tight budgets,several eatery close for people on budget. Cons: My time did not have negative comments."
POSITIVE,beautiful hotel in the midst of the city. close to airport. hotel provide shuttle to airport & for an reasonable price you can also get shuttle to port of miami.
POSITIVE,Other than not getting the room I wanted the word resort is exactly what it isPros: Location was great staff was very personable food was fantastic. Cons: The parking is just a bit to tight.
POSITIVE,"We ended up here late one night, front desk gave us the managers rate and then extended it to the following night as well - the gal in the continental breakfast was very attentive and made the stay very pleasant! Rooms were clean - my son and I shared a king suite. The beach was a quick walk - great location! Definitely would stay here again! Room Tip: There was some road noise, so pack earplugs or ask for a room on the parking lot side."
POSITIVE,"The room was large with a separate seating area, comfortable bed and very nicely furnished."
POSITIVE,"I mentioned that we were going to take the car ferry when reserving the room, and the reservation agent gave us a discount. When we arrived we had a little trouble with check-in, but the staff was very helpful and solved the problem quickly. The slide in the pool area was great. The room was very clean, and the perfect size for a family of four. Two adults and two children. We will be staying at this hotel again. The location was great, the room was very clean, and the water slide was wonderful! Room Tip: Ask to be placed close to the pool area, if you are planning on using it."
POSITIVE,Front desk was extremely helpful and friendly. Looking forward to staying again!
POSITIVE,"Our family of 3 generations had a Holiday Gathering here. The staff was very helpful, the place was very clean and the breakfast was great. Pool and waterslide were enjoyed by all. Highly recomend it."
POSITIVE,"I did a lot of researching and reading reviews here when I was looking for a place to stay. I am happy to report that everyone was right about how great this hotel is! It is totally worth it to get the river view! The balcony is a nice size and they have chairs to sit in. Very quiet beautiful area. The room was VERY clean. And even though it wasn't a brand new hotel, you could totally tell they constantly keep it updated. We got the jacuzzi suite and it was so nice. The jacuzzi worked great and was very large. The bed was SO comfortable. Also the free breakfast was very good. The only thing they could improve on is to get larger and better quality TVs. But that is not a huge deal. I would much rather have a spotless hotel room over a big flat screen TV!"
POSITIVE,"Well located and just a short (5-10min) walk from the sights on Hollywood Blvd. Fairly standard Motel but has a nicely heated pool and spa which was enjoyed by us and our kids. Our room was towards the back and therefore quiet, but rooms overlooking the main road could be noisy. There is a cafe on site serving food but but the rooms have a small fridge [?] and microwave so we self-catered. Front desk granted us a check-out extension to 1pm for no charge. Free hotel computer in the reception area with internet and printer."
POSITIVE,"We brought a group on August 5th and was not disappointed. The whole experience was wonderful. Jeanne Wilson, the Manager, was super helpful, which I don't usually say. I manage a grant program and take large groups of about 50 all over. This was by far the only 100% pleasurable experience doing so, and we'd all love to go back. I personally stayed in room 227, a Family Suite. It was the same as a Double Queen room except for an additional sink outside the bath and an alcove with an extra flat screen TV and a fold out single sofa bed. My Hubby stayed on that, and he said it was the most cushiony, most comfy one he ever had to use. Overall, all said the pillow top materesses were super comfy. Pool and hot tub were very lovely, clean and salt, not cholorine! Major nice. No bad smell. Extra towels and nice tables, chairs and plants. Loved the pool. Impressive, huge hot breakfast...my kids loved the little train that went around near the ceiling. A great place for kids, teens, and families. We had a banquet, and that was wonderful!! Good price! Lovely wall mural in the Tumwater room & it looked out over the pool. I love this hotel and will come back on my own time. They offer massage/spa and have a great mini golf and arcade also. Room Tip: Rooms were very quiet. Mini fridge/freezer and microwave in all rooms."
POSITIVE,"We traveled to Eau Claire for a family xmas. First we called the hotel to get directions and helped us and when arriving everything continued to be exceptional all around. The personnel were friendly and went above and beyond. The suite was roomy and quiet. The buffet was exceptional with many options. We also enjoyed the pool and game room off of the pool. There was also a fitness room. We were very pleased with the overall experience we had at this location. Paula L Room Tip: We stayed in the suite which had two queen beds, table and chairs and its own door Then the main area had the pull out sofa, tv, and another table. There was also a mini fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee pot."
NEUTRAL,"We had originally booked to stay here for three nights but when we arrived and drove round Chemainus decided to leave after one night as there really wasn't a lot to do or see and the restaurant facilities in Chemainus for dinner were practically non - existent. We had originally booked a suite type room but when we went up to it the bedroom area seemed to be more like a large cupboard and as I am clautrophobic I could hardly go into it much less sleep in it. The staff were very helpful and sorted us out with a different type of room. The room was comfortable enough and clean. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about, the sausages and bacon looked quite greasy and unappetising"
NEGATIVE,"Upon check-in my Internet did not work and only after three phone calls to the Front Desk and four hours did they send someone to look at it. During the four hour wait I was told someone would call me. This did not happen so I was forced to call several times more. The shower's water temperature would begin warm not hot then go to cold so showering [?] was quick and uncomfortable. I called the Front Desk and was told someone would look at it. I returned that evening still a warm to cold shower awaited me. I called again and was told that someone would look at it. Again, the same thing. Upon check-out I told the Front Desk clerk what happened with the shower and she simply said 'Sorry about that'. There wasn't the slightest bit of sympathy in her voice and she even seemed to look at me as if I was going to ask for something like a free night or a lesser bill. She wrote something on a piece of paper regarding the cold shower and said 'Thank you'. This hotel used to be one of my favorite but from sparsely stocked and reused breakfast items, to weak Internet connections, cold showers and poor Customer Service I will add $20/night to my usual hotel budget when I am in the area and stay somewhere else from now on. They have finally convinced me that they do not care about full Customer Service."
POSITIVE,"very clean, easy access from highway, great staff, comfortable bed, hot water,"
NEUTRAL,"The room was large and clean, the bed large and firm, the staff friendly and helpful. Beyond that, the experience went downhill: breakfast, raved about by some, was plentiful but mediocre at best. Steam table eggs and hashbrowns were warm but wet and/or mushy. Bacon and sausage, crisp on the one hand, soft on the other. The TV was standard definition, not what you expect at a Best Western. More important, it was placed so that it was difficult for two to watch from bed and impossible to watch from the sofa. AC typically loud. There are plenty of restaurants in the area but it's a 15 minute drive to downtown Long Beach. Overall, I wouldn't return or recommend it to a couple, like us, traveling for pleasure and staying 4 nights."
NEUTRAL,"Newer BW property. OK property. Don't like the long hall to get to my room. One cart, always in use. Brekfast was average for hotel fare. Room Tip: Get a room close to an outside door."
POSITIVE,"Newly renovated and very clean room. I stayed overnight for the space coast marathon and was very pleased, especially for the price. I am very picky about hotels and when I booked this I was a little nervous, but I have no complaints!:)"
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed 2 nights at the Louisville Inn and Suites while visiting family in Louisville. The hotel was a good value. All the hotels in Louisville are clustered together in a good location. I had an interior room that was quiet and clean. The staff was helpful, breakfast was decent. I needed to check in very early (11 a.m.!) and they accommodated me. I would stay again or recommend to others."
POSITIVE,"I travel for business and was tiring of the excessive charges and surcharges of the premium chain hotels. Searching for hotels in Montreal, I discovered the Best Western Ville-Marie and saw that it received good ratings and decided to give it a shot. It's in the heart of the Montreal business district, and easily accessible to offices, shopping, and so on. Boy, was I impressed! The hotel was very clean and modern, and the staff delightfully attentative and responsive. The beds were a definite step up in quality and comfort over others in this class, and the heating and ventilation systems were quite (a big problem for me). The best surprise for me was the Lebanese restaurant, which surprised me at a BW. It was recommended that I try the fillet mignon shish-kababs, and they were succulent. The wine list featured a Lebanese choices as well, that accented the meal nicely. This hotel definitely hits the mark for business-oriented travelers who need good value but appreciate a fine experience. I was delighted and will definitely return."
POSITIVE,"I AM VERY HAPPY TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL. BREAKFAST IS GOOD, REALLY LIKE THEIR CLEANLINESS WITH THE UV LIGHT AND FRIENDLY STAFFS."
POSITIVE,"From the street this hotel is kinda scetchy, but once you walk through the front doors the atmosphere completely changed. The room was Great and super clean. We loved our stay."
NEGATIVE,Pros: Don't recommend anybody!
POSITIVE,This was my first stay at the Taos Best Western and won't be my last.From the moment we arrived I was totally impressed from the welcome we received to the well appointed rooms.But the kudos have to go to staff who made our stay one of the best ever.
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel location is perfect, our room is clean and the workers are also nice. my only negative feedback is there's this person between the doors of the hotel wearing a cap and a jacket with an airport taxi logo who keep on asking me if i want to go to the airport , I told him the bellman is calling me a taxi , he still insist that its the same price 65 bucks to jfk. When I ask him how come its to expensive he told me he works for the hotel and that's how much they charge. When i ask the bellman if he ( the guy with a gray van with airport taxi sign ) works for the hotel he told me no. The bellman got me a cab for 55 bucks including tolls. How can the hotel let HUSTLERS do that to the guest just like they do at the airport."
POSITIVE,The woman that checked me in was extremely nice!
NEUTRAL,"Never expected to have so much trouble finding a room along this stretch of road. We were glad to get the last remaining non-smoking room -- a king suite. One person at the desk was crabby, the other was friendly and helpful. Elevators old, unappealing. The sitting area of the suite was not so nice -- old furniture, chairs with food stains, old couch. The fold-out mattress was terrible -- until I realized it had been made up upside down. Much better right side up. Several bulbs out, but they sent someone up right away. King bed was very comfortable, nice linens. Bathroom clean but old/worn. Bfast decent, not as good as some. When all was said and done, we had a good night and would stay again."
POSITIVE,The room was very clean. Their breakfast was excellent! The cost of the room was reasonable. I would stay here again :) I recomend it.
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel several times in the last six months. I own several hotels. The front desk staff at the Evergreen Inn & Suites, specifically Ashley and Nicole, are absolutely fantastic. VERY personable and professional. Breakfast is great, and rooms are clean and comfortable. All in all a VERY good option as a place to stay in Federal Way."
NEUTRAL,"Our plane got in very late, beyond the shuttle van's operating hours, and the shuttle driver waited for us, was courteous and had a good sense of humor. The hotel was very close and convenient to the airport. The staff was friendly and helpful at the front desk and at breakfast the next morning. For a convenient overnight stay near the airport, I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Impeccably clean, comfortable, and courteous experience. Very much appreciated after I'd just had the worst night's sleep at a Hampton Inn in Columbia, MO. Made our cross-country trip so much easier! I have back problems, and their mattresses at this Best Western were outstanding - I'd love to know what kind they are to get one for my husband and I when we need a new one! No complaints here! Thank you for such a great stay! Room Tip: Try to get a room with a window facing the mountains - spectacular!"
POSITIVE,"Room was large and very clean. Beds were very comfortable. Had a room in the back with a nice view of the trees in pretty fall colors. The restaurant, Myrtie Mae's in the hotel, was excellent. Would definitely stay again."
POSITIVE,"I stay regularly at this BW Cooper's Mill. It was remodeled after the flooding in Cedar Rapids in 2008. It's amazing to think the water level reached to the 2nd floor! They have recovered beautifully. Rooms are fresh, clean and updated. Very comfortable. Near downtown, yet very quiet. The staff is friendly and helpful, and it's so convenient to arrive and be able to stay for dinner at the restaurant or drinks at the lounge. The size of this hotel makes it homey and comfortable. Room Tip: Higher floors have a great view of the River and downtown area."
POSITIVE,The hotel is in a fantastic location if you want to get to the beach or even take a short drive into downtown L.A. It is also much cheaper than just about every hotel in the area. It is a bit older but was pretty well kept up and was most certainly clean. You can get 20% off a meal at the attached I-Hop by mentioning it to the front desk. (lunch or [?] dinner time) The staff were very friendly as well.
NEUTRAL,the room itself leaves much to be desired. lighting is aweful.
POSITIVE,"Very cute, close to Cabrillo College, and great breakfast"
POSITIVE,Most comfortable hotel beds I've slept on. Very inexpensive and good quality room.
POSITIVE,"My wife and I just got back from spending two days and nights here for our wedding anniversary, and we could not be more pleased with this hotel! The rooms were very nice, the flat screen TV was great, in-room safe, large shower, tall toilet, extremely comfortable bed, and motorized shades with the controls right next to the bed! The ocean-view was amazing at all times of day and night, and it is just a 1 minute walk away from the beach! The staff was very polite, professional, and prompt with their service. The restaurant was a little dark at night when we went to eat, and honestly we found the prices of the food not quite matching the quality, but its a hotel restaurant, and we only ate one meal there ($66 for sea bass, mashed potatoes, a soda and a coffee). Only things I would change would be bundling the price of parking ($15 per day) into the price of the room, adjust food pricing, and have a few more channels on the TV."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed at this hotel for a night, and was very happy with the decor in the main room as shown in other travelers' photos. However, the bath tub was peeling, and we killed 2 small cockroaches during our stay - one in the bathroom, one running on the ceiling above our bed. Although it's a good price for the room size and location, I simply can't sleep well knowing there are small insects crawling around."
POSITIVE,"Nice sheets, very clean, just be aware that it has smoking/non-smoking rooms, so in the morning, you feel a sliht cigarette whiff on the hallway. Othewise, in the room there is no odour at all."
NEGATIVE,"Typical 2** hotel. Very small worn out rooms, though pretty clear. WiFi signal was pure in the rooms we were staid in. We were surprised by pretty good breakfast, not typical for this kind of hotels. It's good if only all you need is just some place to sleep at night in + to have a good breakfast in the morning."
POSITIVE,"Nice warm feeling to the lobby. Very decorated for the holidays. Check in and out was a breeze. Room was adequate. Somewhat cramped - especially the bath room - I've had larger baths in Red Roof Inns. For the price paid, overall, a good value. Be aware, however, that once you step outside your room, there is a terrible aroma in the air. Not your typical farmland manure. This was a bit more noxious. It is the smell from a nearby sugar factory. The end product is certainly sweeter than the product in process."
POSITIVE,"We stayed in the Best Western Old Main Lodge for an overnighter for the football game against OU. Sic Em Bears! Anyway, this hotel, although dated, is not bad at all for the price. The room was convenient, clean, and in a safe location. They provided a small breakfast in the main building, which was not bad at all but not great, but you can't ask for much more at less than $80 a night. Althought the lady at the desk was not overly enthusiastic, she was fairly pleasant. One of the travelers with us left a pillow behind and they were kind enough to let us pick it up on our next trip to town. All in all I couldn't complain and would say that you can't go wrong with this choice."
POSITIVE,"Friendly Staff, Hotel is walking distance to Washington State. The free Tacoma trolley is close by."
POSITIVE,"Came here to see family members and it was good location for us. It's right on the parkway, and close to belk shopping center, and walking distance to the some restaurant. Hotel was clean and staff was really friendly. Breakfast was good and pool was clean that me and my family enjoyed. I will stay here again when I come to this area."
POSITIVE,"Room was quieter than I expected, given the hotel's proximity to the highway; bed nice and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was much better than most--with quite good coffee!! Wow! Staff were very pleasant. Convenient to UTDallas, etc. Good value, nice stay. LIke the ""library"" vibe."
POSITIVE,"cleanness commode keep stopping up was great since I go to coushatta a lot. Actually, the stay was nice and the hotel was very nice, the only problem was the commode keep stopping up, so had had to call for service twice, it actually was like that when we first arrive in the hotel, but over all the staff and the stay was good, I have recommened best western to families and friends in the past."
POSITIVE,"We booked it because of its location to family. A little concerned cause it was only a 2 star. Pleasantly surprised to find it exceeded our needs. The room was great, very very clean. No outside noise. The price was right. The only problem was it was October and the pool was not heated. Aside from the pool, I would highly recommend this hotel. On our [?] next trip, we will surely stay here again. I would give it a 3 star rating to say the least. Thanks to all."
POSITIVE,"This motel was wonderful. Great value. And the beds - superb pillows and coverlet - both are down alternative and luxurious! The room was comfortable and very attractive for a motel, with a nice TV. The staff was great - friendly and helpful. Reasonable rates, too. On the highway, not in the historic part, but convenient for travel. Liked: Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"My husband is a truck driver this location meet all of our needs, extremly large parking lot, close to restaurants and mall. The Hotel itself was big and roomy with lots of elevators. It was extremely clean from walking into the lobby and leaving to ride in elevator to go into our room. The night and moring receiptions was helpful and friendly. We would [?] definitly book here again. From West Texas on business in Massachuettes."
NEUTRAL,"I've stayed at this hotel twice for business. The location is very good if you have business in the Burbank area as it's close to all of the studios and is in a cute neighborhood with lots of restaurants. The room has a mini fridge and microwave, so if you're staying for a few days that's a nice bonus (and there's a Trader Joes up the street) There is free parking under the building, and a free breakfast, which is basic but offers the always enticing ""make-your-own-waffle"" machine. On both visits I noticed a strong, musky smell in the lobby; my room on the first visit smelled like they cleaned it with Axe cologne and I had to air it out by keeping the window open (should've requested a new room), but the second time the room had no offensive odor. Staff is low key, but friendly enough and are happy to accommodate your needs. I'd stay here again."
POSITIVE,"We stayed for just one night but it was very good. We liked that we could access our room from outside so we literally parked our car right outside our room. The room was comfortable and the beds were dreamy. There was a complimentary brunch buffet which was quite adequate and filling! It was very clean as well, for me that is a huge priority! We were also able to check into our room early which was a bonus because we arrived in Halifax very early in the morning. My mother in law had flown a red eye and mt husband, toddler and I had a short flight but we were up at 5:00 am. Good service and very quiet!"
POSITIVE,"Excellent place to stay! Me and the hubby came for our anniversary and it was nice. Good staff, clean rooms, excellent location!!!! Definatley recommend"
POSITIVE,"It's an older hotel but everything is in very good condition. They have taken care of this property and it shows. We had 2 queen beds and they were very comfortable. Each bed had 4 nice pillows with nice linens. Plenty of fluffy, clean towels. The room was large and quiet and extra clean. Bathroom was large with lots of counter space. These people know what a travel wants and needs. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and am glad we decided to stay here."
POSITIVE,"This was a good hotel - spacious room with a fridge and pullout couch which was close to nice restaurants on St. Joseph street. Brief walk uphill to Upper Town, but very doable. Close to Cirque de Soleil show which was great! This hotel worked well for our family of two adults, two teens. The parking was $20 per day with free in/out which was also nice, but we were close enough to walk most places."
POSITIVE,"Got this on a blind Hotwire last minute deal. Described as 3* but seems 4* to us in quality. 2 great queen beds, spacious room, super new and clean. Quiet, luxurious. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Close enough to old city attractions. Great restaurant! Keurig coffee machine. Super TV!"
POSITIVE,"This place was great! Hotel personnel were friendly and helpful especially Patty when checking in! Their free breakfast was the absolute best - not only did it have the usual that Best Western provides, it had sausages, hot biscuits and gravy! Easy to find - just off exit 10 on Interstate 10!"
NEUTRAL,"Chose Best Western for a last minute Big Bear trip. The Good: -Great Complementary Breakfast! Had eggs, bacon, potatoes, with the normal continental stuff, with a family of 4 can defiantly reduce your over all nightly rate subtracting a breakfast every morning. -quiet place -basic hotel room size The not so good: -kind of in a dead area, not close to Village or water -room needs a closer eye to detail when cleaning; cob webs in corner, someoneâs hair on lamp shade -Luke warm hot tub, for a town that has several hot tub stores when you drive around, yours should be in good working order, I over heard another guest complain about temperature and front desk called in but by next day still the same. -they should liven up the game room area, or just get rid of if."
POSITIVE,"Clean, nice size room. Close to I15 freeway and several good eating places. Excellent breakfast."
POSITIVE,Would stay again. Super comfortable bed.
POSITIVE,"Liked: Service, Location, Rooms"
POSITIVE,"It was OK. Wish bathrooms were updated and rooms were brighter.Pros: Friendly and helpful staff and good restaurant. Cons: Dark rooms, wall heating units loud, hot tub broken, toilet didn't flush all the time, and water park a joke."
POSITIVE,"We loved the pool and hot tub, great family spot. The breakfast was awesome, enjoyed everyday of our stay!!"
NEUTRAL,"CLOSE TO LIGHT RAIL GOOD ACCESS TO MUSEUM RESTERAUNTS TREATED LIKE A 5 YEAR OLD WITH HAND STAMPS THEY ARE LUCKY THEY ARE LOCATED NEXT TO THE TACOMA DOME WAITED IN A LINE THAT STRETCHED OUT THE FRONT DOOR FOR AT LEAST 30 MIN UTES JUST TO CHECK IN. EVEN WITH A RESERVTION THAT WAS MADE OVER A MONTH AGO. ONE ELEVATOR WAS OUT OF SERVICE WHICH CREATED LONG LINES AT THE OTHER THE ALTERNATIVE BEING 6 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO LEAVE YOUR ROOM. WE HAD TO HAVE OUR HANDS STAMPED WHEN WE LEFT THE HOTEL IN ORDER TO BE ALLOWED BACK IN THE BUILDING AFTER 9 PM AND WAS ENFORCED BY SECURITY GUARDS CHECKING FOR YOUR STAMPS!! WHY ISNT A HOTEL ROOM KEY SUFFICIENT LIKE ALL OTHER HOTELS?? POOR SERVICE IN THE LOUNGE ,LONG WAITS FOR SEVICE AND ONLY A 3 HOUR WINDOW FOR BREAKFAST LEADING TO OVERCROWDING AND INSUFFICIENT SEATING WHICH IS GREAT IF YOU DONT MIND STANDING WHILE YOU EAT IF YOUR SMART YOU CAN DO IT WHILE IN LINE WAITING FOR THE ELEVATOR. IT FELT LIKE STAYING IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTY."
NEGATIVE,"Positive points :Room and bathroom are clean 200m away from Alexandra Bridge, walking distance from Parlament Breakfast is goodNegative pointsVery small room TV doesn't offer any movies No soft drinks machine in the 6th floor Restaurant and bar close at 9:00 PM Building is quite outdated, looks like neglected by its owner No fridge in the room"
POSITIVE,The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. There is a restaurant on site as well as several other dining choices practically across the street as well several places to shop. My only complaint was that express checkout through the television was not yet available at 5 am.
POSITIVE,"After a long night of driving, I found myself passing through West Kelowna on my way to Salmon Arm. After seeing the Tim Hortons sign from the Highway, I stopped in to get a coffee to keep me awake. Right across the parking lot from Tim Hortons is the Best Western. I figured I'd poke my head in and ask how much a room went for. After walking in the beautiful lobby and being greeted by a young friendly female front desk agent, and getting a reasonable rate, I decided to call it a night. The room had a King sized bed and was nice and comfortable. Room was clean,also nice and quiet and overall the hotel was very clean. In the morning breakfast was fabulous! Bacon,eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, and WAFFLES! After eating a couple waffles, I figured I should check out the fitness centre (summer is coming). It had a nice variety of equipment, and was one of the better ones I've seen at hotels. The pool I didn't use but it had one. Waterslide too. I will definitely stay at this hotel again!"
NEUTRAL,"Stayed two nights over thanksgiving weekend. The first room""s toilet was not working so were given another room that was larger and on the first floor. Bed was comfortable, room was clean (bedspread of first room;s bed was rather garish) with free WI-fi and free breakfast. Small room for breakfast but we wound up with a table. Good overall value for a hotel room in the middle of Brookline, Mass.. Would stay there again. Room Tip: Ask for a ground floor"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel for one night. The people at this hotel real nice and helpful, the room was beautiful and the wine reception was a nice touch. They let us keep the car in their garage until 3:00PM after checkout which is is plus in this area of San Francisco where parking is so expensive"
POSITIVE,"Was in San Francisco on a business trip. I normally stay at business hotels, but a friend had told me about this hotel at a fraction of the cost. The room was pleasant and staff excellent. It was not as clean as I would have expected, but that statement must be measured against someone with a military background and German mother. I would clearly stayÂ at this place again."
POSITIVE,My stay was pleasant. Only thing I didn't like were the trains that passed by quite often. At night I didn't notice them because the bed was so comfortable. I slept great.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for one night while traveling back home from a road trip. This hotel is great. The staff were friendly and helpful with any questions that I had. I stayed in a double queen room, it was neat and clean, I could actually find an accessible plug-in for my cell phone (seems to be a problem with some hotels as you have to move a piece of furniture or un-plug something else in the room). The beds were very comfortable and you have a ton of great pillows. The bathroom seems small but the shower is spacious!! I stayed on the fourth floor and it was very quiet. You have everything in the room but no mini fridge. No fridge would be the only negative about the hotel but then again it could have been the room I booked. I'm planning another road trip in the area so I will be staying here again."
POSITIVE,We planned a meeting with our Lonestar NCVA group at this hotel and wow what great service. It is one of the only hotels downtown San Antonio that does not charge for parking and a hot breakfast available as well. The front desk staff was great and helped us in the meeting room. The rooms are large so plenty of room to visit in the evening. Our handicapped members had great rooms as well. We would definitely would plan another meeting at this hotel. Carol Room Tip: Rooms with windows on Commerce might have a little more traffic noise.
POSITIVE,"Only a short walk to riverwalk, great price for location, free parking."
POSITIVE,"Right off the freeway, in the middle of a ton of restaurants and stores, convenient to everything. Quiet despite location. Good for overnight stop."
POSITIVE,"It looks like this hotel got run down, but they have been working to gt it back up to snuff. Only downfall was our AC went out in the night. I am sure they would have moved us, but our child was sleeping and we didn't want to go through that. They did bring us a box fan. The attached water park is very nice, if not huge."
POSITIVE,Good. Hotel for the price. Clean and rest staff!Cons: Had ants in bathroom.
POSITIVE,Every thing I needed was in the hotel or near it. Wolfechase is a great area to while away the time. I will be back!!!!
NEGATIVE,cheap. rooms not cleaned unless requested. small pool no umbrellas. breakfast poor stay elsehere
POSITIVE,This was our first ever trip to Biltmore and found this hotel to be not only very clean but extremely convenient to Biltmore. The full service hot breakfast was also first rate. Very affordable! Will definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"We booked this hotel mainly because of the price. At that time, we were concerned that it might be a bit far from the center of activities. As it turned out, it was not. If you want a nice, clean, quite hotel away from all the tourists and traffic, and yet very close to to Gaslamp District, zoo, Seaworld, then this is the place. If you intend to spend most of your days in Old town district, then they might be a little drive. The staff were polite and friendly, and the hotel is located very close to the freeway. Room was very clean, with microwave and safe box. While they do not provide free breakfast, they have very nice coffee machine at the lobby where you can make a nice cuppa but you have to be there before 8:45am; or you can dine in the restaurant across the parking lot with 15% discount."
NEUTRAL,"This is an historic in with a lovely courtyard that's right on Front Street in Lahaina. While the rooms are small and very dated, it's worth the money based on location and service by the staff, who are very helpful. Also, parking is included, which is a big plus in Lahaina. Small room and bathroom."
POSITIVE,Really comfortable and clean. No room service but what do u expect 4 a best western.
POSITIVE,"The hotel as well as our individual room were both very well-kept. The housekeeping service came each morning and had no problem coming back to our room after we had left for the day. The staff was friendly overall; however, when walking into the hotel after a long day, we said hello to the staff member at the front desk and they did not respond. I would hope they simply did not hear us, but I find this unlikely since it is a pretty quiet hotel. Also, the breakfast was adequate, just the run-of-the-mill continental breakfast. The pool area was very clean and quiet. Although this may have been because we were visiting during the week. There had been other reviews about the liquor store next door as well: the staff there was very friendly and helpful. It was not loud by any means at night, but we were there during the week. The manager at the liquor store did mention that during game season (specifically football), there are many people who will park their RVs there. This may have contributed to one of the past reviews for the hotel. Regardless, Bubbles is spectacular and definitely a place you should check out... and Best Western, of course."
NEUTRAL,"We got there late at night, and the two guys at the counter were rude. Like either they didn't like Americans or were just plain rude just they way they talked. The room was disappointing because it was not what was shown in the pictures. It was an older room and had an old TV and it looked like dated. The build of the room was fine, but it was a bit [?] dated. The next morning, two other guys were at the counter and were rude as well. There were some ladies that were nice at a different shift but the guys seemed to be the most rude."
POSITIVE,"Location, convenience, great/friendly staff - very helpful. Elevator is slow and they have only 1, poor TV options Good, convenient, easy parking, near the road but quiet nonetheless. Not the Ritz, it is a Best Western......a solid mid-grade hotel.....and delivers on that promise and more at reasonable rates. Staff was great.....convenient location.....pool is a bit small but OK; I have spent more and gotten a lot less."
POSITIVE,"The location is great, the staff is nice and the hotel rooms are beautiful! We come here every year and will be back for spring break in a couple weeks, I can't wait! Location: Mission beach is beautiful, very touristy and the kids love it. Blue Sea Lodge is sitting right on top of it, which is perfect because then you don't have to really plan on going to the beach, you can go whenever! Morning walks, day time swims, moonlight strolls, its all right there! Rooms: The rooms are always clean and totally adorable. They are average size, with nice bedrooms and a good closet. Can't complain! Staff: This is the best staff ever. They are constantly happy and always handing out little toys to kids and fresh baked cookies! When you are walking out the door, they ask where you're going, always have directions available, and 9/10 times have a coupon available to! Coupons they offered us: Sea World, restaurants, a boat trip around the bay (Sea Port Village) and San Diego Zoo (really, if you're going there, make sure to ask for a coupon!! It can get expensive) Seriously, if you are on the fence about this hotel for a family vacation, couples vacation, whatever, book it now!! Booking fill up fast and trust me, you will not be disappointed! Room Tip: They are all nice."
POSITIVE,"Let me just start off by saying I am in my late twenties, very outgoing during the day, and enjoy getting out at night. This hotel was very well kept, has a good helpful staff, and is perfectly situated at the beach. I spent over a month researching the different hotels in the areas based on price, reviews, and location. The price was actually negotiated lower over the phone by about 17% as well as getting a free night of parking thrown in ($10 value). The bars/clubs are about a 10 minute walk away on Garnet Ave. There seemed to be a mixed age group of guests - nobody complained about our 2am return. Our room was in pretty good condition. There were efforts to upgrade some amenities like fridge, microwave, AND a nice flat screen TV, but other amenities were just average... which was fine by me! NO bugs or anything like that. Clean sheets/towels. Room Tip: North facing side of hotel for ""Partial Ocean Views."""
POSITIVE,"Excellent weeks trip,best hotel for service,shuttle to local amenities,breakfast,excellent room and customer service I have no hesitation in recommending and would use again as opposed to other hotels. We saved approximate ï¿½ï¿½1000 planning this trip with this hotel and flights with united when compared to virgin!!!"
POSITIVE,"My family stays here several times a year on our way to/from California. The rooms are big, comfortable, great linens and towels. The check-in/out service can be a little slow if only one clerk is on duty. The on-site restaurant serves great food. On this stay it was evident that my room had not been used for a while. It was like a freezer! The heater did not produce enough heat to warm the room to a comfortable temperature so I resorted to several hot baths to keep warm. Thank heavens for hot water! At bedtime I crawled into freezing sheets with my clothes on and hoped for the best. I had an o.k. night's sleep. I did report the heating problem to the front desk when I checked out and they said that they would have maintenance look at it. I think that because the rooms have outside entries that if they are not used often they just stay cold. If you are going to stay here in the winter time you might want to ask that the management turn on the heater in your room a few hours before you arrive! Room Tip: Check the heater when you arrive (in winter) or, better yet, call and request that it be turned on before your arrival!"
NEGATIVE,Rude people and strange town management is very arrogant .makes sense why no one stays there well overpriced at 110.00 dollars with the only reason can be there is not another hotel in that town. Save yourself the money and the rude looks and attitude drive on down the road to the next town.
POSITIVE,We loved our stay. The hotel was nice and the food was great. Thanks No Pool
POSITIVE,"The hotel is clean and close to everything. They had outside sitting area which was nice for breakfast. The desk personnel were very nice and helpful. They had a pool and a hot tub. The laundry mat was right next door. We would stay here, again."
NEUTRAL,It was just ok...my daughter loved the pool tho. the bed was comfortable.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is very well situated near the beach and Stanley Park. Rooms were comfortable, spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bus stop is in front of the hotel. Good restaurants are nearby. Certainly recommend this place"
POSITIVE,"I did not expect that we would get anything more than basic services and amenities.We stayed thrice over 5 nights in August 2011. We were happy with the Front Office staff in particular ,all of whom went out of their way to help us with our million queries and concerns. The rooms very comfortable and well maintained and the presence of a micro wave was useful.We got help with our heavy bags too,which was really important.Recommend highly !"
POSITIVE,"My husband and I recently spent two nights at this Best Western in Corpus. Located on North Shoreline Blvd., the hotel sits directly across the boulevard from a beautiful harbor. We were on one of the upper floors and had our own balcony with a harbor view. In fact, supposedly, the hotel sits so all the rooms have good views. And it is much lower in price than one would expect for that location. The free breakfast they offered was very good - scrambled eggs, bacon, juice, etc., not just the usual free cereal or toast. Being gluten sensitive, I was quite impressed with the food both mornings. Plus, breakfast was on the 11th floor - with huge windows on both wides overlooking the city and harbor! We had not been to Corpus in ten or so years, and I had forgotten what a beautiful city it is with palm trees and beautiful homes all along the shoreview drive - this bay city which once called itself ""Naples of the Gulf."" Room Tip: If you like to be near the breakfast area, choose a room near the 11th floor."
POSITIVE,Nice motel with very few people stayiing there in the winter.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was a great value and a very nice place to stay. I was in Toronto for a Daughtry concert (love that band) at Massey Hall, with three friends and we were all pleasantly surprise at how nice the hotel was. We stayed two nights. There is a workout room on the 3rd floor which a nice man I met in the elevator told me about. He said he loved it, though we didn't use it. A Tim Hortons in the lobby makes a morning run for coffee and treats an ease. We had a 21st floor view facing downtown and could see the cn tower. Amazing. The room was lovely with free WiFi!! Parking below the building for only $23 a night. The location is a few blocks east of Yonge St. Once on Yonge it's about halfway between Eaton Center and Yorkville. We walked to both. It's a slightly longer walk to Queen St. but that's the only way to get around Toronto in my opinion. I thought the room was lovely - great pillows, beds were comfy and nicely decorated. Only two doubles, not queens, but that was fine for us as we were all small people. A king is available. There is a restaurant at the hotel which looked nice but we did not visit. The staff at the front desk were great. At night there was someone in the lobby to ask to see room keys to make sure we were supposed to be there. I liked that kind of security. When we called the front desk for extra towels they were delivered promptly and a maid in the hallway also brought us some. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Toronto!"
POSITIVE,"For the past five years, we have stayed at least five times a year whenever we go to visit my son after he married a sweet girl from Cartersville.... The rooms have been now remodeled in the past year or so and the beds and the four pillows on the beds are absolutely wonderful,.,.,.,.. The prices are always reasonable and they have now added more items to the breakfast.....Waffles are still my favorite.... I tried the eggs this last time since I am trying to cut back on breads.....Jim, the desk clerk, has been with them since we started staying there and he is such a great asset to this property..... He always remembers us when we come in , and after a tiring trip, it is great to come into a place and start your stay out with a great laugh or too....Believe me, he is so much fun and loves his job, you could stand and visit all day long,.... It is so handy, just off the interstate and you have Cracker Barrel, McDonald's, and The Fruit Jar Cafe, among other places on this exit..... If you ever need a good nights sleep on I-75, stay here, because the rates are the best of all the places and it is always clean.....They have free wi fi if you have your own laptop, and if you don't have one, they have a computer in the lobby you can use free of charge....."
POSITIVE,"We come down to Anaheim Hills quite often to visit family, and we always stay here. We just went back again on January 13th, and as usual, it was a good experience. The front desk is friendly, and the location is very convenient right off the 91 FWY. It was a clean, very standard room with few frills, but for the price, it is always perfect for our needs. Great shower, tiny scratchy towels, pretty good bed, lots of parking, and a fun diner next door with good breakfast and a great bar. We will continue to use this hotel as our go-to when we come to the area."
POSITIVE,"This is an older hotel but from inside the room you wouldn't know it. I accidentally laid the thermos on the bed only partly closed and soaked the comforter, etc. I told the maid and apologized and there was no problem or charges. Some wrote of a moldy smell, I didn't notice but my husband said he did a little but it wasn't bad. My mother who can be critical had no complaints and the breakfast was in the top two of our nine day trip except for weak coffee. We found the rate, $112 with tax for two queens competitve for the time and area."
NEUTRAL,"To be fair, I don't usually stay at 2-star hotels, so this was not the usual accommodation I prefer. A friend and I stayed for the Sarasota 1/2 marathon and we needed simply a bed and bathroom for one night. It was average, nothing special, but served its purpose for our needs. Room and bath were clean. Beds were a little on the firm side, not super-comfortable, but ok. Towels were kind of cheap and crappy (one had holes in it). Toiletries consisted of just soap and one bottle of conditioning shampoo. There is a pool across the parking lot. Our room faced the pool so the location was quiet. Room rate comes with breakfast, but since we were running the race, we did not eat there. Front desk was very friendly and when we asked for a late checkout so we could get back and shower after the race, they happily accommodated. Location is not far from the downtown area and St. Armand's, but you would need a car - it's not in walking distance. Overall, not somewhere I'd normally stay but for the price and location it served my needs."
NEUTRAL,We ask for a quiet room with a view and ended up with a room on the back side with no view and a drunken and foul language party of 12-15 people going on directly outside our room until after 9PM. They were construction works who the desk clerk said had been there for 30 days and she could do nothing about it. We left in the rain for another motel where we could get some rest. Room Tip: Ask for room on front side with a view See more room tips
POSITIVE,"I spent Thanksgiving Night (Nov 24th) here. The rooms were in tip-top shape, the bathroom was very clean and everything was laid out nice. It wasn't noisy as there was little traffic outside. They have a nice-sized flatscreen LCD television, very speedy wireless internet, a microwave, an oversized small fridge (about 3' tall, not the standard 'dorm-size' ones) and everything was very clean. Lots of space to relax. I had a king-sized bed with four pillows and a couch that would fold out. A nice desk and office chair to get work done with PLENTY of electric outlets for your gadgets (on the desk and both nightstands). I had limited interaction with the staff. At check-in at the front desk, the lady was very cordial. At 8am sharp the next morning, housekeeping knocked on the door. I assume it was because the car parked directly in front of my door had already left so I assume they thought I had left. To avoid this, I guess be sure and put the 'Do Not Disturb' card on your doorknob. The only semi-complaint I could even mention is they were out of non-smoking rooms and they had to give me a smoking room. And at $89/night, I thought it was a tad pricey, but I didn't mind paying it."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has more than location, although that's great too. The bus conections to downtown Vancouver are excellent. For about the cost of downtown parking, two people can get day passes at the Shoppers Drug Mart next door and avoid fighting off the aggressive drivers who have no tolerance of confused out of towners. Bus drivers and passengers are really helpful to tourists. We found the king bed to be extemely comfortable and the room fairly spacious. The second floor patio is a nice quiet retreat. The underground parking is a bonus and is included in the room price, not a big add on. The hotel staff's advice to go to Martinis about five blocks away for good food and drink at half the cost of downtown was well taken. Breakfast service at the hotel and at the adjacent restaurant were adequate for staring the day. although as late sleepers we are always more interested in lunch and nearby Broadway has lots to choose from for that. The underground parking area is very difficult to mauever in if you have anything more than a small car. The colour of the walls and their angles creates an optical illusion in some places that makes it hard to know if you are going to hit the wall when backing out. Maybe each angle of the walls should have a different colour. Since we used the bus except on one occasion, this was not as much of a problem for us as it could be for daily drivers. We were underwhelmed by the service at the adjacent restaurant."
NEUTRAL,"I was very disappointed that the breakfast room used all disposable plates, cups and cutlery! I was travelling with a colleague from overseas who commented ""I thought Canadians were more responsible than Americans!?"" Really did not enjoy being forced into a much larger than usual ecological footprint during my stay!"
POSITIVE,It was convenient to where we were visiting friends and an easy onto the TransCanada in the morning to head to Kelowna.
NEGATIVE,I was picking up a friend at Portland Airport and wanted a place close to the airport. I usually stay in Best Western and this one was not up to my expectations. Free wifi was intermittent.
POSITIVE,The room was clean and a good location to Portland. The breakfast was okay but they have a jar of peanut butter that everyone can use. That is a health issue for me!!
POSITIVE,"OVERALL my stay was EXCELLENT-these last two times! I normally ask about dog friendly-ness, but failed to. We did not have a dog show event when we stayed-thankfully. But, I would never have known this hotel was dog-friendly, because the hotel was so very clean! No hint of Dog Odors, and I do have a very sensitive nose! My breathing sensitivities do not allow me to stay in a room that allows pets, but I never had an issue the last two times we stayed at the Best Western-Inn at the Meadows. I WILL ask about dog show bookings-because I appreciate not having to yield to dogs in the hall or elevator, and I sure don't want to hear the pitter patter of paws all night in the halls or rooms next or above me. And I especially don't want to be barked at when I seek peaceful solice in my room. The Staff was very polite, efficient, professional. Room Tip: we were located on 2nd floor above registration area next to elevator, and never heard anything at all-not even the elevator ding."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here 2 nights, did the Oshlkosh air show with my dad for a day. The room was clean, were able to check in early. Pool area looked nice for familys to enjoy. We used the do not disturb sign so the room would not be cleaned and it was noted, we had clean towels haning on the door even though we did not need them. Ok security, another guest propped open an outside door with no one waiting or watching, so anyone could have walked into the motel, guess some people do not care that a motel has security items in place for a reason. Freindly staff. Would recomend or stay here again if in Appleton."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is a good place for the price and it is convenient to Discovery Kingdom and Infineon Raceway. The hotel has been remodeled in the lobby and some rooms, though our room was not one of them. It was very clean and comfortable. I believe all rooms come with a fridge and microwave. The pool/spa are small and usually very crowded and noisy - avoid rooms facing the pool if this bothers you. Vallejo is generally a rough area at night but they have someone watching the cars all night and they watch you come in and out. The serve a decent continental bfast. The staff was super friendly. I've stayed at this hotel several times and it is always clean and does the job."
NEUTRAL,"I'm becoming a fan of Best Westerns from this hotel in Maryland, and one that I stayed in in Tonopah, Nevada. There seems to be a good attention to detail, and in both places the decor matched the place it is located in -- in Maryland nice lace curtains and period style furniture. The breakfast was good enough and the room comfortable. The reason I didn't give it a better grade was that Fox News was intrusively blaring on the tv in the lobby and in the very small breakfast room. I can assure you that this weary traveler found this very disturbing. This is very partisan and divisive, in my view. What ever happened to some good quality muzak?"
NEGATIVE,This was horrible stinky hotel and is not with any of the star rating it has! I won't ever go back. We actually walked in checked out the room and never went back! Ended up paying to stay some where else that night and didn't get our money back !
POSITIVE,Hotel is literally on the beach not next to it. This makes for a great stay but requires lots of maintenance
POSITIVE,"We had the best travel experience of our lives here. We stayed 5 days while visiting our daughter who graduated from Basic training at Lackland AFB. The Hotel was close (15 minutes from the base and 20 minutes from downtown San Antonio) the rooms were super clean, beds were comfortable, pillows were perfect, the staff was friendly, and courteous. Each day we recognized someone going above and beyond to see that our stay was comfortable. Breakfast was great, eggs, bacon,sausage, waffles, biscuts and gravy,cereals,bagels, toast, yogurt, coffee, juices,danish, the whole nine yards!! If there were six stars, that's what this Hotel and its staff deserved. They really cared about us, our parents and brother and sister-inlaw and cousins stayed in the same Hotel and all were just as impressed as we were. You need look no further if you will be in San Antonio, your stay at this Hotel will be great!"
POSITIVE,Pros: The kids enjoyed the pool. Cons: The room service was horrible.
NEGATIVE,"This hotel would be average to good if they had adult swimming hours and limited the screaming children that were on all sides of us.Pros: Adequate breakfast. Cons: Sent to a 1 queen room when we reserved a two, told we were 'upgraded' to get the two bed room reserved."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times as a one-night pre-cruise stay. When leaving on a cruise from Port Everglades in Ft. Lauderdale, our flights alway arrive near midnight. This hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport and 5 minutes from the Port. the staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the price is right (you don't want to spend a lot on a hotel when you are going to spend a lot on the cruise!). There is a McDonald's next to the hotel if you don't want their breakfast, which is free but limited. Just depends on what you want. The hotel offers a shuttle to the Port for a minimal charge. If you are looking for a reasonably priced comfortable bed to get a good night's sleep prior to your cruise, this is a great place."
POSITIVE,My room was clean and comfortable. I liked the large mirrors and the shower/ tub combination in the bathroom. The front desk staff was friendly. It was a great value for the price. Lots of restaurants nearby. I would definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"DEL AMO SHOPPING CENTER AND RESTAURANTS VERY CLOSE TO THE HOTEL, VERY QUIET."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here on a trip that took us across Nebraska (a trip we've done dozens of time) and this is the nicest $100/nt hotel we've stayed at. Spacious (we had a 2 queen room) clean and comfortable rooms. It really felt a bit more like a room at a big city conference style hotel. They had one of the nicer free ""continental style"" breakfasts too. The free wireless was a nice addition. The beds were too soft for my taste in the room we had, but I'd still take my family here again. I saved about $25 by booking at the Best Western website."
POSITIVE,"Five Stars!Pros: Spacious, clean rooms. Nicely furnished."
POSITIVE,"Location, location, location. Very near Time Square and theatre district. You can walk anywhere, and have fun doing it. Rooms are small, a/c worked well and was quiet. Great water pressure in the shower (a huge thumbs up from my wife). Breakfast in the lobby was over priced for what you could get. Staff friendly, for the price and the location - highlyÂ recommended."
NEUTRAL,"I chose the hotel because of its great location and because it was me, my wife and my 2 kids and the room had a sofa bed. The room was ok, but the sheets were dirty, the room had a bad smell, the noise from the street didn't let us sleep well (we were on the 8th floor!) and the shower sounded like a lawnmower. I'll walk a few blocks next time, but I'll [?] stay somewhere else..."
POSITIVE,"The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, especially Suny at the front desk."
POSITIVE,"If you want to go to sleep listening the the Sea and the breakers crashing, the salt air and the view. This is the place to stay. Recommend 4th floor for the view. Nick's Seafood next door is very nice, great food, and a live band at 8:00pm to Midnight. If you like to walk and watch the ocean without crowds the beach front is for you. Try to get a end room and 4th floor as no one is above you and zero noise if any on a end room. Staff is great during our stay. Underground parking and easy in and out. The bed's are really comfortable which is a must. Can't wait to go back and sleep to the sound of the waves crashing again. San Francisco is 30 minutes North on Hwy 1. Half Moon Bay is 30 Minutes South on Hwy 1."
POSITIVE,"I was in Orlando just for fun and to do some shopping. This place offered me all that I needed on my vacations. Breakfast is a little bit weak, but pool and hotel itself was great. I hope to return soon to this area and of course I will stay in this Hotel again."
NEGATIVE,"September 26, 2011 Regarding the Best Western Motel at Lincoln, Illinois. I stayed at this hotel September 23rd and 24th. I cannot believe that this was a Best Western motel. I have stayed at most of the motels in Lincoln, IL; and this is absolutely the worst motel in town. You have to drive through a bowling alley parking lot and then the parking lot of a bar to get to this motel. The exterior doors have no security system operational. Anyone can come and go at any time of the day or night. The room was not cleaned during our stay. The lavatory had coffee strains in it from the previous guest. The towel rack was pulled from the wall, and hanging from one end. The electronic card which opens the door did not work after the first day of our stay. âFortunatelyâ the cleaning staff left the door to my room unlocked, and I was able to gain access when we returned to the room for our second night. I found the desk clerk ârestingâ on the couch in the lobby when I went there to leave a wake up call. The âdeluxe breakfastâ consisted of two pieces of cold bacon lying in a pool of congealed grease, and what might have been powdered eggs. If this is representative of the new Best Western standard, I will never stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I stayed in this hotel overnight towards the end of March. I booked a business plus room with king bed. The room was as advertised and was rather spacious. It was clean and very quiet despite its proximity to the Trans Canada Highway. The hotel has a rather nice atrium. I did not use the pool. I did not have the opportunity to try the Atrium restaurant however I did eat in the pub (Jd's Lounge) located in the hotel (an overdone hamburger that seemed to take forever to arrive). I also had breakfast in the small Coffee Mill Bistro (excellent service, good breakfast and reasonable prices). The little contact that I had with the front desk was pleasant and efficient. I would certainly return in the future."
POSITIVE,Comfortable and Clean. Everyone was pleasant to deal with. Pros: nice staff Cons: little hard to find Location: well maintained
POSITIVE,"Pros: This hotel served a very nice hot breakfast with many options, They had a computer in the lobby which was helpful."
POSITIVE,"Very good accommodations. Comfortable. Sufficient. Clean. Breakfast was more than enough. Exterior is not all that attractive, but they spend more inside the rooms making them very nice, attractive and clean. I would definitely stay there again.Pros: The room was very clean and well-cared for. Cons: The exterior and lobby were not that attractive. Sort of Motel 6."
NEUTRAL,"Everyone was very friendly. Unfortunately, the valet lost my key on checkout and they finally found it in another car (had fallen out of valets pocket) I was 30-45 minutes later getting to the hospital to see my niece.Pros: Location. Cons: Water in room only lukewarm, valet lost my keys for about 30-45 minutes."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel is clean, beds were comfortable and the staff was fine. The wi fi could not be received inside our room.The walls are paper thin and you hear noise all night long. The doors slamming sound like they are in the same room you are staying in and this went on untill1am in the morning and started up again about 6 am. Bring earplugs if you want sleep. The billing is suspect at best. Watch your Credit card statement as others have stated. They add $1.50 per night for the in room safe in the tax section of the bill. When I questioned this the clerk told me I signed for it when i initialed at check in. Deceptive business practice I feel to advertise a price then nickle and dime you with the fine print after your stay. What next, extra charges for towels, soap, lights, and pillow cases....lesson learned . Read the fine print. Room Tip: Try upper level for less noise. Close to Lobby for better wi fi"
NEGATIVE,We found a bug in the bed under the covers. The sink and toilet didn't work well. The beds were very hard.
POSITIVE,"We were driving through town and needed to stop for the night. We like Best Western so we thought we would give it a shot. I'm very happy we did. The place was very nice. The rooms were clean, breakfast was good, and the staff was extremely friendly. Hopefully we get to come back this summer"
NEUTRAL,"This is the most economic option but it is an older hotel that is being improved slowly. The complimentary breakfast is as good as any you will get. The daytime staff is excellent. It was quiet, i felt safe and felt my car was safe. The drive to DMC is short-- You can follow I35 access road to Oaklawn and turn east and there are many nice restaurants. The quality of bedding improved and the TV's have been upgraded since my last visit. The constant roar of the fan when you turn on the bathroom light remains- The price found on Expedia including an AAA discount was $10. more than last time."
POSITIVE,"Well organized and wide selection on menu... spacious area to enjoy your morning choice including outside patio dining area, Fresh fruit wonderful choice... Thank you to staff, friendly and helpful :-)"
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel & very reasonable price. This is a brand new hotel right outside of Bryce Canyon NP. I see no reason to stay at the lodge in the park since they have great lodging about a mile from the entrance. The breakfast was very good, with a lot of choices. There is a HUGE area to eat (which I though why would they have so much seating) but he realized it in the morning when a bus load of people were at breakfast. BCNP in general was a lot busier than I expected. On our trip we went to several national parks including - Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon (North & South) so buying the America the Beautiful pass that covered the $25 entrance fee at all the parks was great!"
POSITIVE,"There seems to be quite a restricted number of places to stay at when visiting Bryce Canyon, but luckily, this is an excellent hotel. I would just say that you can hear the footsteps of the people in the room above, but maybe, we had a very noisy neighbour!"
POSITIVE,"We decided to stay here because it was dog friendly. The hotel is easy to find because its right off the main road going into homer. the front office person was polite and informative. We were immediatly given a room and were pleassantly surprised by how comfortable and clean the room was. The beds were great and they have free wireless in the rooms. The rooms also have small refrigerators, microwaves and a new flat screened TV.. A breakfast is included in your room rate and it was good, with eggs, sausages,, potatoes, muffins and all the other breakfasts food, Overall, I thought it was a good place to say. Pets stay for an extra 15.00 a night, but its worth it. They have a great staff working here.............................."
NEUTRAL,"This is a standard hotel, kind of what you'd expect.....unfortunately we were given an incorrect room number by reception. This was only sorted after 3 visits back to reception via the slowest lift in the states. The room was large and clean, again, what you would expect. Bryce is gorgeous but the hotel is in a strange location, it was all a bit 'disneyish'. There was a fake train ferrying people from one strange restaurant to a western show.....not very us. Points off for arrival problems and hotel location."
NEUTRAL,"When my wife and I had arrived at the hotel after a long 10 hour drive, we were ""greeted"" by a woman who seemed to be holding a conversation with a co-worker that must have been more important then getting me my key. Needless to say, when we arrived to our room my wife and I were exhausted so we wanted to go straight to sleep. There was either food [?] or blood stains on the comforter, and stains that i don't know what, on the sheets. Instead of the standard two pillows for a king size bed, we got 4 tiny pillows. The Curtains did an awful job keeping the sunlight out as well. This made it near impossible to fall asleep and stay asleep. The following day I needed to Fax something and was told it would cost a good amount of money to fax. Luckily i was not charged, i don't know if whoever told me it would cost money was mistaken, or if whoever helped me to fax it forgot to charge me. So that was nice. If you ever do decide to stay at this hotel, do not order the Italian food that is provided. I know this has nothing to do with the Hotel, but they were terrible. On the day of my departure i carried all 6 of my just under 50 lb bags to the lobby where we were told we would catch the 1100 shuttle to the DFW Airport. We left at about 1125. I put in 4 out of my 6 bags in to the shuttle, my wife put one in, and another passenger helped with the last. The ride to the Airport made my pregnant wife and I sick. But i guess that's our fault for sitting in the middle. I do not recommend this hotel because it seemed unprofessional and not very customer friendly. It seemed as if the employees did not enjoy their job and acted as such. They get a paycheck whether I'm happy or not, right?"
POSITIVE,"We chose this place after reading other reviews from tripadvisor. It is a 5 stars for location, value for money, and good service. This is our 1st time staying at Bestwestern after being a seasoned Marriott member. We are very pleased with the experience. There is a great hot breakfast with plenty of selection. The room is very spacious and clean. Strongly recomended this place. Also recomended folks to visit Bryce during off season. September and October are great months to visit."
POSITIVE,"We make it our priority every year to visit th Ocean Sands. The people that work there are so friendly and kind. It has the best ocean front views and is in the middle of North Myrtle Beach. It feels like home, Our kids can't wait to go again!"
POSITIVE,Stay Here its a Great Hotel
NEUTRAL,it was satisfactory nothing wrong. nothing really great either
POSITIVE,Nice Hotel
POSITIVE,"We weren't able to drive all the way to Pigeon Forge, TN due to my husband's work schedule. We had gotten a late start and decided to stop in Commerce, Ga. to spend the night so that we could get an early start the next morning. We had never stayed at this hotel before and actually made the reservation on line before leaving home. The hotel was a little hard to find as it is off the road, but was well worth the hunt. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was HUGE, breakfast was good, and the staff were nice. All in all, this was a great choice."
POSITIVE,"Room was very clean, comfortable, and pleasant. A little hard to find but well worth the effort. One of the best values for the money I've ever stayed in."
POSITIVE,This hotel is the best if you are flying out of St. Louis. The fly and stay rate is sooo much cheeper than airpoft parking and you can take the 24 hour airport shuttle which is included in the price. The BEST beds and pillows ever the most comfortable. Even spoke with staff about buying pillows from them they said they get that all the time about theÂ beds. The shuttle was great right there when we called no waiting even at midnight ! Place was clean and worth every penny will stay anytime am in the area.
NEUTRAL,"The location of the hotel to down town was decent, but the room was one of the worst i've stayed in for a while. The accomodations are on the older side, but the biggest issue is the noise. You can hear everyone and everything. After hearing everyone coming back from parting in town I was very frustrated with an ice cold shower."
NEGATIVE,"This was the most filthy hotel I have ever seen. Dirt and trash abound from the door. So many better choices nearby. It felt like we moved into the slums for one night. The only truth in the hotel's name us ""Denver."""
NEUTRAL,Nothing specific otherwise.
POSITIVE,"Very large clean modern rooms. Hotel has been recently built and rooms are up to date with large LCD screen TV (36 inch we think), very large desk, corner sofa, coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. Our room had two standard double beds which were really comfortable. Room looked out over the interstate but was really quiet. We enjoyed their free breakfast buffet. We would stay here again in the future!"
NEGATIVE,I specially booked a hotel with jacuzzi to be able to relax inbetween flights. I was very disapointed that is was not in service. that was not mentioned in the booking!
NEGATIVE,Air went out and it was unbearable!Pros: Location. Cons: No air.
NEUTRAL,This hotel was clean and decent for the money we paid for it.
POSITIVE,The hotel was great and the price was even better
POSITIVE,"The hot tubs! that there were always children in the hot tubs =( close enough to universal to walk! The hotel was way more up-to-date and current than prior reviews made it out to sound. It's simple and quick to get to Universal. Not so much to Disney, though it's possible for an extra few (kinda expensive#. The restaurant was ok but the breakfast portion was way overpriced for the quality of food #that could have been included in a normal continental breakfast)."
POSITIVE,I was very pleased with Best Western. The rooms were very clean and affordable. Very close to all attractions. And just a few miles away from where we needed to be next day at the hospital. I do have just one complaint and that is $2.95 for a bottle of water that is in the room. For the price a couple of bottle of water should be included.
NEGATIVE,We needed to change rooms because the Toilet did not work and also the A/C made loud noises all night
NEUTRAL,"The suite we received was spacious, but a tad dated and darkly lit. Sadly, we found a straight pin and a hairpin stuck in the carpeting in the room. When my wife mentioned it to the lady at the desk, she didn't acknowledge the issue at all and didn't apologize or promise to look into it. As for quiet, there was a dull roar from the Interstate all night long. It's not overly loud, but it is definitely not ""quiet"""
POSITIVE,"Hotel is located close to a grocery store, and several national restaurant chains. There is a river trail close by for getting out into nature after being in a car all day. Lobby is in the hunting lodge motif, which is perfect for the northwest. Staff had my check-in ready to go since I'm a BW member and my room was in a good area of the hotel (travelling solo) where I felt safe. The room seemed a little dark, an addition of another light would have helped. They offered soup and sandwiches late afternoon and freshly baked cookies at 8pm. I didn't even need to leave the hotel after check-in. It also has a laundry room and business center where you can check email, print out directions etc. Room Tip: first floor rooms seemed to have a lot of traffic going by them...so second or third floor would pro..."
POSITIVE,The room was very nice and up to date. Colors in the room were nice. Breakfast was good. Proximity to where I needed to be was good. The bedspread looked like it needed washing.
POSITIVE,"We have not seen hotel like that . It was a BIG WOW.....! We normally visit KC Legends once a month for family vacation. We have stayed in all the hotels near legends, but this one by far is the best in location,amenities,services and friendly staff. Rooms have in room water bottled system, big 43 inch TV's, Bath & Body works amenities in bathrooms. Pool with slide. Kids had a blast. Wife had massage at thier spa services. And had good time in the bar- lounge they have. Thank you Best Western KC Speedway. Room Tip: Front side rooms face Livestrong Soccer Stadium & Nebraska Furniture Mart. Back Side rooms face..."
POSITIVE,We stayed at the Best Western Holiday Sands right after Hurricane Irene hit. The Hotel is showing a bit of wear & Tear and because of the hurricane they had power issues with there rooms. The Suite we got was dated. But the room was clean and more than enough room. They have a great beachfront area on the Chesapeak Bay and a nice deck & pool area. The pool was closed because of the hurricane. The breakfast in the morning was stanard. They do need to redo their rooms though.
POSITIVE,I was pleased to stay here before my cruise. They had free transport to the cruise dock and even offered an option for only $8 (I think) to be picked up after the cruise and either taken back to the hotel or to the airport. So convenient. The room was nice and had comfortable beds and pillows. I would definitely stay there again.
NEGATIVE,"The indoor pool is closed, but they don't bother to tell you that prior to checking in. A bunch of guys sitting in the parking lot drinking beer."
NEUTRAL,"West Yellowstone is a small town that exists only as a portal into the Park. ALL businesses in town have a short season and leverage that location by charging prices that would be unacceptable for value received in other areas.In my opinion, my motel room in West Yellowstone was about 33% more than the perceived market value. Lodging in the park, if available, is a far better deal."
POSITIVE,"Super close to everything downtown. Great place to stay for hockey/football games. The arena, stadium, and all the night life was within walking distance. Nice staff and breakfast was good. There is also a quicky mart on the front of it if you forget anything. I would absolutely stay there again. Pros: Super close to Bridgstone arena and all the bars on the strip. Cons: Weird light switches. And make sure to ask about parking, it was worth it to valet but the charge to park on-sight was a suprise, not bad though, $10 Location: It was really close to the highway and also close to the capitol building, art museum, country music H.O.F., and convention center"
POSITIVE,"Q's is amazing, especially for breakfast. The Corner Bar is fun all day & good food. Service was very good. It's a great hotel. Nice Looking Hotel. The bar was great. I would recommend this little event to all tourists. hotel decor is very elegant and beautiful. This is a must-see for little children or for people of all ages."
POSITIVE,"To be honest I can't believe some of the other reviews that have been posted. The room was very nice. The staff was VERY PLEASANT. You could tell they were trained to provided the best customer service possible. They always had a smile on their face, and you knew that they would do anything to make your stay pleasant. The room was wonderful. The beds were very comfortable, and well the HUGE HD TV was just the icing on the cake. We will definately visit the East Texas area, and the Best Western of Marshall will definately be the place we stay."
POSITIVE,"The toiletries - yummy! no a/c pleasant Best Western Hotels are well represented with this site! Everything was in excellent condition. Minimal rooms available for pets and those are upstairs. Refrigerator, coffee, great toiletries in the room. Found that I was warm over the early morning hours - no a/c. Would recommend to friends and family without hesitation."
POSITIVE,"Close to the airport, fairly effortless shuttle bus service, Ease of check-in and check-out, efficient staff, clean room, comfortable bed. No room service, really just a nice place to sleep near the airport. Not particularly cheap."
NEUTRAL,"The shuttle service was very accomodting. That made our trip less stressful! Also, it was close to airport. It would have been nice to have more food places to eat on the same side of the street. Crossing that street was very busy and dangerous. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Clean, comfortable. Close to the airport but not too close. Staff friendly and helpful. Good value for money."
POSITIVE,This is a great little hotel with such great people. Nothing is too much trouble to make you comfortable and happy. Room Tip: Most of the rooms are the same with the exception of bed. Some have a king or two doubles and some had regular beds and a pull out. Some of the rooms have a frig if this is important . See more room tips
POSITIVE,smell to room on arrival. cured with some fresh air from window. hotel is kept too cold. maid always left the ac on max.
POSITIVE,"My corporate headquarters is only a block away and the price was right. My room faced the courtyard and the curtains were sheer so the light was pretty bright all night. Also, I didn't like feeling that people could look in as they were walking by. Either get less sheer curtains or make the drapes closable. Thanks"
POSITIVE,We had a one bedroom condo and it was absolutely perfect. Great location close to Tin City and 5th Avenue and the beach. Plush greenery around the pools with hot tubs with bridges and flowing water over the rocks. Perfect environment. Continental breakfast was great outside. Walking distance to Harold's Tiki Bar. Would definately stay there again. We [?] are from the East Coast of Florida and enjoyed the different scenery of the West Coast.
POSITIVE,"Recently stayed at the Best Western Airport Inn in Calgary overnight with my husband. He stays at this hotel often when he is in Calgary. I was surprised at how good it was because from the outside it does not look like much and is actually kinda sketchy looking. Dont worry though once you are in your room the beds are great, the rooms are spotless and the flat screens are great. We stayed in room 333 and the king size bed was very comfortable, They also supply 4 king size pillows which were also very comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was really good as well, With toast, bagels, yougurt, boiled eggs, make your own waffles and cereal as well as juices, milk and really good coffee. The staff were very pleasant and helpful as well. Wireless internet is free and worked well on my Ipad. I would recommend this hotel and we will stay their again, the value is incredible."
POSITIVE,Have stayed here numerous times over past two years and have always enjoyed an extraordinary meal every time. We have dinned in some of the finest restaurants in Toronto to Las Vegas.... the chef at the Governor's Inn should be commended for his expertise in menu options .... fabulous preparation and presentation. the finest quality of fresh local seasonal ingredients with the utmost perfection in flavors and quality.... what a perfect place for a talented chef to call home... the most beautiful beaches..... small picturesque lakeside community... the farm fresh options for ingredients and the freedom to arrange daily menus based on his creative flair... Such a hidden little secret... a must to enjoy.... !! We will continue to spend many a weekend here as hospitality of the entire hotel speaks for itself... simply wonderful. Mr and Mrs M McWilliams
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very nice. Had clean, COMFORTABLE beds. We traveled to Phoenix with a tour group and were assigned a room with two queen beds that were wonderful. The room was clean and attractive. Well appointed with coffee maker and hair dryer. No fridge or microwave. Several restaurants within walking distance. Nice hot breakfast in the a.m. with enough seating for about 30 people to have breakfast in a clean and attractive area. We did not have time this trip to use the pool. Staff was wonderful. We had a couple that were unable to walk to the restaurants due to health concerns, and one of the staff drove the couple to the restaurant and picked them up afterward. I call that extraordinary service. Nice stay. We would stay there again.l Room Tip: Don't book a room facing the busy road. Although, the traffic noise was not bac. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This is a good hotel! The location is convenient, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The restaurant is very good as well! Wonderful free breakfast! We also ate lunch and supper meals and were very happy with both the service and quality of the food. We will definitely stay at this spot again!"
POSITIVE,"Great place for a reasonable overnight stay between flights. They've got some remodeling in progress but it's not at all offensive to the guest. Pros: Price Location: Close to O'Hara, food next door and a mall just down the road."
POSITIVE,"Great staff, Great location to everything needed."
POSITIVE,I check the review prior to picking this Hotel and honestly don't understand why anyone would give this Hotel a bad review. From arrival to departure we had a excellent experience. Hotel staff was friendly. The hotel was clean. The breakfast food and facility was GREAT! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone.
POSITIVE,"An except of a letter I sent to the GM: I was recently in Port Alberni and had occasion to make use of the facilities of your hotel. While camping at Sproat Lake, I needed to make a conference call with the Executive Committee of the organisation I run in Hong Kong. Your staff were friendly, outgoing and efficient! They facilitated my making my call and I was also the recipient of your hospitality at your restaurant. The quesidillas were first class! Your director of sales and the front desk staff were wonderful in accommodating me. Unfortunately, I don't get by Port Alberni too often. However, my parents live in Sidney and had occasion to visit after I forgot my Blackberry charger and your team once again came to the rescue. [Since returning home], I have been talking up my visit and that your hotel was great in helping me get business done halfway around the world. Room Tip: Did make use of the rooms on this visit. See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,This hotel is very noisy - both from street noise and water running from other rooms. The breakfast is also marginal. It is low priced - in this case you get what you pay for.
POSITIVE,Nice and very clean rooms--Good Breakfast--Nice to have a hotel that allows pets!!
POSITIVE,"helpful staff not much parking space nice very pleasant. we enjoyed the stay, it was a pity we couldn't stay in the area a bit longer."
POSITIVE,"the bed love the location the beds are showing there age ,,very saggy,,, The cont. breakfast was great."
NEGATIVE,"I had a very bad experience with this hotel. I requested a late check out and for which I would pay . I was told by the hotel staff it would be okay to check out late. However, when I returned from a bussiness meeting I found my luggage in the lobby and was unable to get access to the room. I would not recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,The jacuzzi (hot tub) suites are AmAZING. Fresh towels at our door every morning even though we post the privacy please sign up. Absolutely love this hotel. Book in advance to save more!!!
POSITIVE,"All the staff were extremely, helpful and efficient. Customer Service abounds at this hotel. Each hotel room is laid out well and rooms are very spacious. If we are ever in the area again, we will most certainly stay here and have also recommended this hotel to friends for their families when visiting. Thanks. Jean Snyder-Kull"
POSITIVE,"Granted, this isn't a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it's not what you're paying for. This is absolutely the best option in the price range! This is the 2nd one I stayed at and again: clean, friendly staff (they go out of their way on service actually!) and an outstanding value - better than the recent HI Express and Hampton experiences I've had! And it's a short walk across the street into Macy's at Mall of America and to fabulous food. Bonus: shuttle service is really well done, easy to and from airport, they'll even ""check"" your bag for the shuttle in the AM while you head to your all day meeting until you need it for your evening ride to MSP! Highly recommend, especially for biz travelers."
POSITIVE,We always stay at the Tuscan Inn.. we love everything about this hotel. The service is excellent...
POSITIVE,"We could not fault this hotel at all.The staff were great particularly the manager Ed, the wine in the afternoon fabulous and the tea & coffee in the morning much appreciated. Our room was just lovely, 2 double beds for three of us and great views of Coit Tower and the Pyramid building. We wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we are fortunate enough to go back to San Francisco again. Also we were there for a week and bought a weekly MUNI ticket for the cable cars, trams and buses for $27 and it was definitely worth it."
POSITIVE,"We generally travel 1st class when wer'e on vacation, but decided to give Tuscan Inn a try with all the great reviews. (Plus, the place we stayed last time, Fairmont Ghiradelli cost $600+/night now.) Tuscan Inn didn't let us down. Why we loved this place: 1. Location - Tuscan Inn is located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. It was so convenient to walk everywhere ... Fisherman's Wharf eateries, shopping, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, cable cars, Ferry Building, downtown, etc. Getting to/from Napa/Sonoma was a breeze. 2. Rental Car - We needed a rental car for just 1 day (during the day) and didn't want to pay for overnight parking. Both Budget and Dollar are right next door. 3. Cost - it was the cheapest 3-star hotel in Fisherman's Wharf, and it even included a nightly wine reception. 4. Clean - While the rooms are a bit dated (i.e., peeling wall paper, tube TV, a little rust in the shower, worn towels, etc.), the room was spotless. Every day we could count on housekeeping cleaning our room and bringing clean, fresh towels. 5. Comfort - Aside from the occassional street noise, the room we received was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. My husband and I had some of the best sleep/naps ever. 6. Service - From the valet to the reception to housekeeping, everyone met us with a smile and hello. Tips: 1. Arrive early to the wine reception or you will NOT get any hors d'ouerves. 2. Turn your A/C or heat to low to avoid the loud ""kapow"" when the unit kicks on. 3. Except where marked for cleaning, you can park on the streets at Fisherman's Wharf for FREE between 7 pm - 7 am. 4. Skip the long wait & $$ at Pescatore and go to IHOP a block away. They have good, quick service and good, hot eats. Room Tip: Ask for an accessible room - our bathroom was HUGE!"
NEGATIVE,Small room for a family with only a small double sofa bed for the 2 kids to share. We found pier 39 a bit tacky and so location although great for fisherman's wharf was a bit wasted on us. If I were you I'd save money by staying downtown & just go to the wharf for a visit.
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed the hotel tremendously. Continental breakfast was very good. Service was excellent. Had a repair that needed to be made in the bathroom and after notifying the front desk, it was fixed immediately."
NEUTRAL,"This was just a 1 nighter stay over until we could get to Napa. we've stayed at this hotel maybe 3 times in the last 10 years. The main reason we stay here is it's proximity to the Buena Vista bar where we got their awesome Irish Coffees (coffee with Tullamore Dew whiskey and a dollop of whipped cream) and looked out at the Golden Gate Bridge. The rooms are VERY small but were clean and functional. It's a nice area to have as a 'home base' for any San Fran vacation because of the close proximity to cable cars, Golden Gate Bridge and everything else San Fran has to offer."
POSITIVE,"09/18/2011 Recently, my friends & I stay 3 nights at this hotel & we were very happy with the hotel. It was very clean, attractive, comfortable beds, good price & value & the hot Continental breakfast was great. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends. In fact, I would recommend this hotel chain. SAB"
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this Best Western again, after an initial good experience, and it didn't let me down. The accommodations, customer service, breakfast, and comfortable beds were all top notch. I will continue to stay at this location, when I visit my family."
NEUTRAL,"Room was cleaned upon arrival and cleaned everyday on a timely manner. Continental Breakfast was good and saved us time and money. Wish they told you that internet price didnt include taxes, my bill was fifty dollars more then exspected."
POSITIVE,"Nice property, great service from all staff but the young lady that helped us mostly was fantastic, okay breakfast with wide selection of foods, relatively quiet being next to freeway, a little trouble sleeping as light from the TV remote had to be covered up, same with light on clock next to bed...little things that could easily be fixed. No problem staying there again!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. The hotel manager (Dennis, I believe) was phenomenal - friendly, accomodating, and helpful. They let us checkin early without notice and volunteered helpful info about location as well as things to do. The hotel is conveniently located and the staff was friendly. The free breakfast is nothing fancy but adequate. We would definately return."
POSITIVE,"We loved this hotel. The staff are friendly, the rooms are comfortable & spacious. They have opening windows & the mini fridge was so handy! The pool area is fantastic - views right up the mountain. Sitting in the spa looking at the sun setting was wonderful. Resturaunts and the village are within walking distance. There was a little Mexican resturaunt [?] about 10 minutes walk up the road (on the same side as the hotel) which was great. I think it was called Amigas or something like that. The hotel also has 2 resturaunts on site - one pricey and one cheaper."
POSITIVE,Cons: Walls were thin. I could hear people talking very clear in the next room and in the hallway.
POSITIVE,"Like other reviews say, this place is located smack bang in Chinatown and Little Italy! It's also a stones throw from soho shopping with 2 subway stations very close by! We originally caught the bus and subway from the airport, but as we had so much luggage and no escalators/elevators at the station, I will definitely recommend catching a taxi or shuttle to/from the hotel. The reception can actually book a cab to JFK for $55 through a deal. We booked a minivan through Dial7 as we are travelling in larger groups. Breakfast here is interesting. There are boiled eggs, MYO oats, an awesome waffle machine, fresh fruits and juice as well as your usual continental stuff. There are so many different foods sold in the area so we only had breakfast there for one day. Hugh at reception helped us check in earlier which was very much appreciates. After an extremely long and tiring flight, and bad experience with some surprisingly rude people on transports and streets, we were keen on a nice shower and change of clothes. This hotel is simple and comfortable! We will definitely stay here again and I will highly recommend others to do so too! It is the turnaround to the start of your trip to NY!"

POSITIVE,Loved having the IHOP so close
POSITIVE,Great little place to stay â cheap and cheerful. The kitchen was a bonus because we donât really enjoy spending a lot of money on restaurants. My wife asked about groceries and the front desk lady recommended we order groceries by FoodStore2Go online. It was a great service and saved us a trip to the store. The weather was pretty bad while we were there but we were close enough to the Atlantis resort so we went over and enjoyed the property. Overall a great little place a little old but arenât we all haha.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was low-key & very quiet...perfect for getting a good night sleep. My mom & I had lengthy Dr appts in OC 2-days in a row so we needed to stay. This hotel was convenient for fwy access and close to the Block for food & shopping. The room was spacious, clean & comfortable."
POSITIVE,"I was really surprised by the quality and variety of food available at the complimentary breakfast. The freshly-made waffles were terrific! I had been expecting the typical, scant ""continental breakfast"" you find everywhere else, but was very pleasantly surprised by the Meridian Best Western. The staff was also friendly, courteous and professional."
NEGATIVE,Hot breakfast. Parking and location. Parking lot was horrible. Bathroom fixtures were junk and the shower head sprayed more on the walls and the curtain than anywhere else. There are better hotels for cheaper in the Allentown area.
POSITIVE,"The hotel looked like it had been recently renovated. All areas were clean and inviting. Check in and out easy. Room had frig, microwave, coffee maker, and iron/ironing board. The bed was clean and comfortable. Breakfast room was large, clean, and had booths with individual TVs. Breakfast was above average with many items. I would highly recommend this hotel for any purpose."
NEUTRAL,"Not a bad hotel overall, but we were kept awake throughout the night by periodic noise from the toilet. It was as if every time someone flushed a toilet anywhere in the hotel, the sound reverberated through our bathroom! The TV was ancient, with bizarre color variations. Pros: Pleasant staff, comfortable Cons: Noisy toilet, antiquated TV. Location: Very convenient to the highway, gas stations and fast food restaurants. Quiet in spite of that."
POSITIVE,Decent clean standard motel with necessary facilities
POSITIVE,"Overall, the hotel was good, but the elevators were ridiculous. Stay on the first floor if you can and avoid the one glacial speed elevator. Otherwise, plan on the stairs."
POSITIVE,"We had no problems when we visited and booked this hotel. Management worked with us because we had an extremely early flight into Myrtle Beach (7am) and they allowed us to check in early and get set up. Staff was friendly on all shifts that we checked in with them. The room was clean, we booked a room with Jacuzzi tub and it was worth the bucks after walking around the beach and going to the Mall and Tanger Outlet. Was clean, the AC worked extremely well, and had a microwave and coffee maker in our room. No problems and had no drunks or any other people around making a mess or noise. Nicely tucked away off of 544. keep your eyes out or you could miss it the first time when driving. Breakfast bar was good food, nothing fancy, but did have a waffle maker. No complaints and was exactly what I needed for this trip. Room Tip: Get a Jacuzzi it's worth it!"
POSITIVE,"good value, very comfortable room, easy to get to airport."
NEUTRAL,"Cheap price threw Hotwire.com the Hotel looked very nice in the lobby when i arrived at my room it was dirty and had to call the clerk to send someone to re clean the room once they did that the roomed looked nice and the hotel does have penitential the hallways are so small and the rooms r on the smaller side. This hotel was nice for the price but it should be a 2 star because there is no way the regular price should be $69 i paid $54 and that seems like a lot once you see the hotel pro-its downtown and cheap for downtown cons-really not a 3 star hotel but a 2 star Liked: Location, Value Disliked: Service, Food"
POSITIVE,"Whilst touring Florida we ended up booking a night here, mainly because the hotel was convenient from a stopping viewpoint. From things I'd read, I sort of expected Jax Beach to be slightly run-down, so we approached with low expectations. Wow!! Were we wrong. This is a lovely, modern hotel and the area is nice. The staff greeted us friendlily and the room was large, modern, comfortable - everything you could hope for. Breakfast was adequate and, after contemplating FionnMcCools and the Pier, which are both on the doorstep, we chose to walk the couple of hundred yards to the Crab Shack - a great place to eat, with good food, a great atmosphere and a waiter who actually explained things to you (pretty unusual these days!). I'm not sure I understand any of previous reviewers concerns about security - we certainly saw or heard nothing to suggest this was an issue. All-in-all, I would be happy to recommend the Oceanfront to anyone visiting the area."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was nice, clean and the staff very friendly. I would stay there next time visiting Clemson. Hope we win next time! War Eagle!"
POSITIVE,"modern, new appliances, granite tops no central heating in the boonies - angel camp I love how the rooms had granite tops and new mini-appliances (microwave and fridge). Everything was clean (and I'm want my room sparkling clean). The towels were folded nicely with decorations like in nicer hotels. They gave us 2 sets of lotions, shampoo, and conditioner. The room had 2 sinks - one outside the bathroom. You can change the spray type of the shower head. The beds were comfortable and clean (smelled fresh). The breakfast by the lobby consisted of reheatable breakfast sandwich and the usual (waffles, breads/bagels, cereal, yogurt, and fruits). The coffee came out of a machine, which was different. The only complaint would be that it wasn't central heating. However, I was not bothered by the noise while sleeping with the heater on. The balcony looks out onto the balcony, but since it was freezing we didn't use it."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel was good value for our money. Located outside of downtown Omaha ... not an issue since driving around the area is easy and it took about 5 min to the old market area by car. Hotel room was clean & roomy, bed comfortable, a/c worked well, parking was good. Biggest complaint was the hot water ... need to let it run at least 5 min before it gets [?] warm. Breakfast consisted of cold cereals, oatmeals, some fruit, pastries, breads and waffles one morning. OJ & coffee weak."
POSITIVE,"We had a fantastic stay. Patty at the front desk was so helpful guiding us to the best places to eat and see. Breakfast was warm and inviting, especially the Texas waffles. Rooms were clean and quiet. The stay was like a home away from home. Will be back for another visit."
POSITIVE,"Clean, basic accommodations - pricey during the gem show. Restaurant was good for breakfast but just okay for dinner, as they ran out of several items. Room Tip: There is no elevator so if you have difficulty with stairs then get a first floor room"
POSITIVE,"Clear, convenient, helpful staff"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here in March 2010 (not 2011). Our room was a standard room with a king size bed. We arrived @ 5am. We were very sleepy people since we were driving a packed Uhaul from MI to AZ. We also had a 20 lb miniature schnauzer. The room was very nicely decorated, very clean and it had no smell, which is what I like. It was cold at 5am in the morning. The heat was turned on and it warmed the room up very quickly. The bed had ample pillows. Those pillows were very plump and very soft. The bed itself was very, very, very comfortable. The tv was in proper working condition as we watched the news. No complaints about this room at all. There were no issues with our Ernie mini schnauzer. The front desk man was very quick to check us in and sympathetic about our 16 hour drive. We were very pleased. Given the opportunity, we would stay @ this hotel again without looking at other hotels as options. Room Tip: We have a ground floor room behind the lobby. Quiet."
POSITIVE,"My family of 4 (2 adults, a 5&7yr old) thoroughly enjoyed this hotel! The location is beautiful with nice views from both sides of the hotel (the marina on one side and the ocean on the other). The rooms were a bit dated, but clean and HUGE!! There was a kitchen area with a fridge, microwave, kitchen table and chairs, tonnes of space in the bedroom area, and a nice bathroom area. The room also had a nice balcony with some chairs on it so we could sit and watch the boats go by. After spending a few days in Anaheim where we were nickel-and-dimed to the max, it was such a relief to get free internet and free parking at this hotel (exactly how it should be!). The front desk staff was extremely helpful and nice. The outdoor pool is heated to 83 degrees and the hottub to 103, and we used both. This hotel is not luxurious, and it is spread out over 2 or 3 buildings in a 2-story motel style. That being said, the price was fair and we felt we got great value for our money here. There is a certain character at this hotel, being right on the marina on a little island, and the neighbourhood seemed very safe and pleasant. There's a kids playground across the street and just down a bit. Just a note that this hotel is within easy driving distance to all of the San Diego attractions, but you will certainly need a car. I didn't see any shuttle service to any of them and none of them are within walking distance."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel would have probably gotten the top review from us if it weren't for the hard as a brick beds. Pros: The setting is great. Roms are spacious and well appointed with nice decor. Fairly clean and well stocked. Pretty quiet - you can hear normal hallway noise and when someone is loud outside. The fog horn and seagulls. I am a stickler about the bathroom. We are a tall family and appreciate when the shower head is not hitting me in the belly button - thumbs up there. Cons: Back to the bathroom. The towel rack that was mounted to the inside of the shower wall fell off into the tub. Luckily no one was in the tub at the time. And the handle to turn on the water came off in our hand. (The staff was informed of the needed repairs on our departure) Then there is the fancy bed. You suppsedly can adjust the firmness with a knob on the side of the mattress. Either ours were broken or they don't work properly, because no matter what way we turned the dial, the mattresses were hard as rocks. Not a very good night sleep. Room Tip: Depending on your view choice - harbor vs marina, in the Casa Marina building you do not want a first floor room to view the harbor. You get a view of a shrub that blocks the cars in the parking lot."
POSITIVE,"We booked a block of rooms for my son's wedding at the Best Western Island Palms, San Diego CA in the Point Loma/Shelter Island area and everyone who stayed there gave it 5 stars. Wide selection of room choices, breathtaking views of the marina, bay and downtown San Diego, very clean rooms, friendly and efficient staff, and very quiet. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever used, even my 12 year old nephew remarked about them. Very large rooms, choice of either facing the marina or the bay and both were outstanding. The pool and spa areas overlooking the marina had breathtaking views. Family members used the shuttle service to the airport and they arrived on time and were very efficient. I live in San Diego and plan on returning just for a weekend get-away. Close to the airport, and an easy drive to the downtown area, Old Town, Balboa Park, and Coronado. I would highly recommend this resort without any hesitation."
POSITIVE,"We are a family with kids aged 2 and 10. There were quite a few downtown and Gaslamp hotels on sale at the time I booked, but we decided on this hotel due to its unique location that offers a bay view frequented by both gigantic carriers and small fishing boats alike. Very San Diego. The Gaslamp area was good for wine and dine, but with kids we do think this area is safer. The bonus of this location is its proximity to the airport, which is handy as we never know what the traffic situation is anywhere in southern California. We are upgraded to an Island Palms one-bedroom suite with kitchen facing the bay, from a Del Mar junior suite. Our room is double the size of the guestrooms on 1st floor, therefore I think those guestrooms are pretty small. The bay view is as good as the marina view, but as the bay facing units also face the car park, some noise cannot be avoided esp. in the morning. During night time, it is okay. For our unit, the walls are actually stucco-like, which in my opinion is not very upscale. But all in all, the other things like bed comfort, cleanliness and shower pressure, are all adequate. The pool area at the main building is not crowded and a pool will guarantee some fun for the kids, something that most downtown hotels do not have. In my opinion this is rightly a 3-star property based on the condition of the rooms, but with this expectation in mind, you will be pleasantly surprised at the location and its great value compared to other pricier alternatives such as Paradise Point or Dana. Room Tip: Try to switch to Marina or Del Mar if you get an Island Palms room facing the parking lot See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"I usually stay at Hotel Circle on my frequent trips to SD. They must have had a convention or something on my visit as this was my fourth choice before getting a vacancy. I stayed here with my family about 15 years ago. It was kind of poignant seeing the same swimming pool where I think our 3-month old daughter first went into a pool. Today, she is one of the top swimmers in our High School district. BW Shelter Island offers many scenic vistas. It was neat going out to the balcony and watching a Navy cruiser transit the harbor. The room was nicely appointed and clean. I also liked their gym. My only two gripes was no washer/dryer machines (I like to come home with clean laundry)."
POSITIVE,Wow what a nice place to stay before the cruise. The drivers were outstanding. Pointed out the local attractions. Very well done on customer service. We would for sure stay here again.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here after a long drive from Vancouver on our way to Jasper. We were 4 adults and 2 children and had booked a 2 bedroom suite, one with a queen bed and the other with two double beds. It's cheaper than taking two separate rooms although the suite was small with one small bathroom. Both rooms had 2 flat TV screens; however, you cannot watch them independently as they are connected to each other. One channel at a time for both TVs. Nice lounge area with free coffee/tea/hot chocolate. Usually Best Western hotels have continental breakfast included but this one had a full service restaurant attached to it. Breakfast was OK. Reasonable prices and good service. After a long drive from Vancouver, it's a good place to rest before starting your trip to Jasper National Park."
POSITIVE,"I hate to say it but I never liked Best Westerns! I hesitated to book here because I always felt they were sub par and I prefer B and B's. Well, I am now a fan of the Best Western Plus chain. This hotel is located right on the Columbia River which is why I choose it. I will admit it is located right off the highway exit and there is a Starbucks and McDonaldâs in the same parking lot, but our room faced the water and we never heard or felt any tourist or parking related noise. Once we entered our room the focus was always on the water. We chose the west side of the facility, second floor facing the water. This was based on other trip advisor recommendations and it was the right thing to do. They are renovating the east wing and when we walked through that side it did seem more dated and dark. Make sure you ask for the west bldg. We also upgraded to a junior suite and it was fantastic. Very roomy. A separate living/ dining area with a fireplace. The bedroom was huge and the bed was very comfy. It had a set of slatted double doors which was great for privacy. Both rooms had a flat screen TV and sliding doors with another large window above it for a fantastic view of the river. Each room had access to the private balcony. One warning, if you sleep with the window open you will hear traffic on the bridge that crosses the river. The hotel provides earplugs complimentary.We did not need them as I found it interesting to hear and watch the traffic. And it did die down considerably at night. Our room included a kitchen area with a microwave and refrigerator and a large dining table. We hated to leave the room. However we did, every day, to enjoy their on site restaurant and complimentary breakfast which was very good and very filling. The waitress remembered us each morning and seemed genuinely interested in our travels. We liked the food so much we went to dinner one night and had such a great meal we took leftovers back to the room and had them for dinner the next night. You also get a coupon for 1/2 off the second entree. They have a great bar and everyone you encounter is very proud of their hotel, and the Hood River area. We stayed 3 days and could easily enjoy another week. Room Tip: Coose the west side bldg and get the upgrade to a junior suite and the river view, it makes for a great experience."
NEGATIVE,"I wasn't expecting the Ritz-Carlton, but this was way below my expectations. The staff was accommodating, but not really very friendly. The room needed to be seriously upgraded - worn carpet, tired furnishings. Not really anything horribly wrong, just blah. Towels thin and worn - and you won't find any extras for washing your hair. The bathroom was tiny and not well-kept, which is real sore point with me. We've stayed in a lot better rooms for a lot less money. Not in a nice area! Room Tip: I doubt that there is one. Find another hotel."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is clean and comfortable and the continental breakfast was good for a continental breakfast. The best thing this hotel has going for it is one of their Managers, Bobby Shook. He is courteous and doesn't hesitate to jump in and help out to do whatever it takes to make the guests happy. We have done repeat business here because of his service. Pros: Bobby Shook, Manager, was awesome. He was a jack of all trades and worked to ensure guest comfort and satisfaction. Cons: Some times the housekeeping didn't show up until late in the day. Location: Convenient location. We had to go to the Mayo Clinic and it wasn't too far away...."
POSITIVE,"Our stay at this hotel was a pleasant experience. The room and linens were clean and there were no odors, still looks brand new with appealing design."
POSITIVE,"First time staying at this hotel and we shall be back. Staff was very friendly, pool was clean and breakfast was good but could have used some fruit among the selections. Could think about extending breakfast til 10am for vacationers hwo sleep in a bit. This hotel is in a great location close to Sedona, Camp Verde and Jerome. Check for coupons at Roomsaver.com. That is where I got a great rate for this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Went to a graduation. Hotel was just a few blocks away from the location of the ceremony and just around the corner from the restaurant we had our celebration dinner. Our Grandson enjoyed the pool at the hotel and we all were very happy with the hot breakfast. Great place, perfect location, will go there again."
POSITIVE,very nice ocean view at this hotel and the breakfast was great very good price for the location this isnt a fancy hotel
POSITIVE,"My stay at this hotel was extremely positive. Just the location of the hotel on Shelter Island warrants serious consideration as a hotel to stay at when visiting San Diego. The original Best Western here bought out a neighboring hotel and merged the two. Thus, the hotel has both a tropical vibe and a Mediterranean vibe. It is nicely settled on a thin sliver of island flanked by the main port of San Diego and smaller Marianas. This guarantees that any room will have a water view. The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was very good (although there are better restaurants down the street). The front side of the hotel has one of the best vistas of San Diego and the naval station (we routinely saw large naval vessels heading out to/from the sea). The rear side overlooks several large Marianas.Its only a 5 minute drive from downtown San Diego along the harbor (although it may seem farther). The place even has complimentary bike rentals so that you can bike the length of the island. You may even see the occasional sea lion that peruses a fishing pier out in front of the hotel."
POSITIVE,"This was my first trip to San Diego and our stay exceeded our expectations. The hotel was immaculate and the views was breathtaking. Every staff member at the hotel was friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.... Pros: Close to hotel, located at the most beautiful marina... Views were breathtaking and conveniently located to everything Location: SHELTER ISLAND"
POSITIVE,"This place was great!! Everything was clean and the beds were incredibility comfortable, the staff was very friendly and helpful!! The breakfast was wonderful, with the waffle option AND French Toast, sausage, fabulous scrambled eggs, plus all the other usual breakfast options - cereal, yogurt, etc. Plus, there was a Denny's right across the street for an quick and easy dinner. If I find myself in that area again, I'd make sure this is where I'd stay!!"
NEUTRAL,"I was returning with wife sister and 2 yrs old kid to Orlando comming from DC. Pick up Raleigh to stay because of a friend of mine that told me this was a very quiet town. THe town was really quiet, at this hotel the staff was really polite at the front desk but they gave us a room at the south building and the accommodations were really old and outdated to be a best western but that was just bearable, I found really unpleasant bumps and door slamming at 2 am in the morning my sister wife and me were really uncomfortable with those noises. Besides all of this the breakfast was really nice."
NEUTRAL,After hotels.com sent me to the wrong hotel..........I was supposed to be booked at the tualip best western. I drove to the first hotel only to find out it was the wrong one and had to get back on the road and head to Everret where they at first gave the the wrong room number and we ended up trying to enter someone else room. location of the hotel was [?] not so great the room however was very clean and quiet.
NEGATIVE,The hotel was convenient to Disneyland as we had hoped but that is about it. They advertised queen sized beds in kids suite and we in fact got full sized beds. They also advertised two bathrooms per kids suite and we got one small bathroom. Not at all what we thought we were getting. Very close to disneyland which was a plus. Parking situation could [?] be better at the hotel as well. Overall it's a two (2) star hotel not much more. Breakfast is a joke. Better off walking two and q half blocks to IHOP to get a quality meal. Staff was indifferent to us our whole three(3) day stay. Maybe would stay again if Portofino kids suites are sold out. Get what you pay for!
POSITIVE,It was good for one night. The staff were not as accomodating as I would have liked. The breakfast was okay but lacked instructions on how things worked and if you needed hot water for chocolate or oatmeal it was not available. It was inexpensive and good for the one night. Nita
POSITIVE,"Employees Great employees and price, good location and place to stay"
POSITIVE,"The hotel is a good value and has a convenient location in one of Brooklyn's best neighborhoods. The subway, eateries and coffee shops are all a walking distance from the hotel in a safe neighborhood.The hotel front desk is rude and the doorman indifferent to some patrons, so do not expect much courtesy from the staff, to be expected from some in New York.But overall better to stay here than much more expensive Manhattan."
POSITIVE,"For my business, the location for this hotel is very good. I feel that the value for the money was also very good."
POSITIVE,"Very convenient to Plymouth tourist sites, accommodating staff, nice breakfast bar, comfy bed--and they care about recycling!"
NEUTRAL,"Liked: Rooms, Service, Location Disliked: Value"
POSITIVE,"pool was open 24 hours, Internet was free , free breakfast Could use a little more parking. Worked great for us easy on off freeway , local Starbucks close by away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Great place to stay bed was very nice room was nice. Staff was helpful slept great everynight shower was great good water pressure. Great experience."
POSITIVE,"The front desk, housekeeping and adjacent restaurant were all fine. The location was very convenient for me, but the area was a little sketchy. I would recommend and stay there again, though."
POSITIVE,Comfortable room. Clean. Friendly staff. Good value. A friend and I make an annual one night trip to Annapolis and have stayed there the last 4 or 5 years in a row. Will be there again next year.
NEUTRAL,"I was surprised that a Best Western was ranked #2, but decided to stay here with my two teenagers anyway. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and all seemed well at first. My husband and I spent some time in Champp's watching the NCAA tournament, the kids swam for a bit, but found the pool crowded and boring. Worn out from our day of sight seeing, we wanted to go to sleep early, but couldn't because it was so NOISY in our room! That continued until about 11:15, when the pool area finally emptied out! My husband turned on the A/C and we all turned in. He awoke at 2:30am and realized the A/C wasn't working. Thank God the window opened! In the morning, I couldn't get the bathroom light to turn on. Mentioned both problems at checkout and was told we should have called maintenance when we realized the problem, even though it would have woken up the whole family. Strange experience, that's for sure! The hotel gets a three for the staff - if it wasn't for that, it'd be lower."
POSITIVE,"What more could you ask for? A good rate, a good location, a friendly greeting, a nice quiet room, a VERY comfortable bed, and a good breakfast."
POSITIVE,"Convenient to highway, lots of places to shop or eat nearby. All was good."
POSITIVE,"We only stayed one night as we were in transit through Calgary. Our flight did not arrive until late and so we found ourselves checking in at 12.30 am. Even so, the staff were bright and cheerful and welcomed us with a friendly smile. We were in our room quickly. The bed was very comfortable and the facilities met all our needs. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. The buffet was good value and the food well prepared and presented. Checkout was uneventful and we were on our way as smoothly as we arrived. Overall a positive experience and very good value when the cost is considered."
POSITIVE,Annual trip to Saratoga to the races. Stayed 3 nights. Rate was good and hotel was running more smoothly this year. Think this is the 5th year we have stayed here. This year was a good year. Convenient location. They are putting an outdoor swimming pool in. Hope prices do not escalate because of this.
POSITIVE,Very clean and nice for a family to stay. Close walking distance to and from Disneyland.
POSITIVE,The only ever so small issue is that the roll away bed that we needed in the room was not in there when we arrived and we had to take it to the room but it was ready right away for us to take it up to the room. Great Room for the price.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here in Wilkesbarre for our swim meet. It was right next door to our pool and 1 block from public square that had restraunts shops and dunkin donuts. Check in went really smoothly. We noticed a lot of renovations in progress from last time I stayed here it was a positive sight to see. Also. The people were all so friendly and helpful all over the place because our lunches were in a different part of the building. Our room was awesome. We had queen beds that smelled good and had extra pillows in the room and extra blankets indiviually wrapped so we didn't have to ask the front desk, very convinent and unusual to find in a hotel. In the room was ihomes, huge flat screens, fridge, microwave, nice comfy chairs, and a rubber duck LOL! We all thought that was so cute. After our breakfast which was awesome we left the day and came back later to a nicely refreshed room and dinner. There was a nice work out center for us to with a flat screen.All in all our weekend was awesome, and Genettis renovations are looking great! Can't wait until next time we are back!"
POSITIVE,"The staff is very friendly, with mostly gay managers. It's one (long) block from the heart of the Boystown bars/clubs/restaurants and there are plenty of GLBT friendly restaurants and bars on the same block. The continental breakfast is limited compared to most Best Westerns, but the WiFi connection was good in both our rooms, and overall our rooms were clean, quiet and spacious. I'll probably only stay here on future trips to Chicago."
NEGATIVE,"stay anywhere but here, when I arrived, I used the bathroom. As I was washing my hands I noticed that there was excrement smeared on the toilet tank, below the handle. Then I took a look around and began to realize how dirty it was. Yes they gave me another room. At best I could describe it as threadworn. But what I really disliked was the head of housekeeping calling me a liar, when I discribed the room. To date there has been no return call from the manager. Really,...I mean it, stay anywhere else."
POSITIVE,"Absolutely worth an adjustment in your route to stay here with your furry children. Friendly staff, very clean, quality furnishings & linens, free wi-fi, good hot breakfast. Great Value. Choice of better quality chain restaurants for dining. Only neg - close to airport so we heard a few planes. Will definitely stay here again with pets."
NEUTRAL,"Great location near the Space Needle, plus The Funhouse nearby is a fantastic venue for local music with great acts passing through regularly. The staff was super friendly (hey, it's Seattle man) and the room was both spacious and affordable. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a no frills stop in the Emerald City."
POSITIVE,The property public spaces and my room were very clean. The staff was outstanding
NEUTRAL,"Clean hotel with very courteous staff. Wonderful location oceanside and within walking distance of water taxi, fishing charters and the beach restaurants and shops. Recommend to all"
POSITIVE,"This is not the fanciest hotel but it is always clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant on site provides complimentary breakfast which was very nice, homey food. The pool area is relaxing and clean. I could pay more for a fancier hotel but the accommodations here are more than adequate and I can stay longer to visit with what I saved in hotel costs."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here on New Year's Eve. The hotel entrance is really nice an modern although it does involve lugging your bags through some narrow doors and up a flight of stairs (there isn't an obvious lift anywhere). Check in was very smooth and the desk staff very polite and helpful. Our room was upstairs and miles from reception which was a bit annoying but one of those things I guess. The room itself was small but clean and had everything you could need except an iron but these are available from reception. Unfortunately the rooms aren't as nice as the reception would suggest but fine for an overnight. We didn't have breakfast so I couldn't comment. We did have coffees from the bar which were very good and the servioce again was excellent. Overall we had a pleasant stay, what you'd expect for the price, nothing exceptional, I'd stay again. Room Tip: Get a room close to reception"
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I arrived Feb 17. We had a room on the 3rd floor and is was clean. Bathroom is very small but OK. Again it was clean. New bathtub tile, but sink, wallpaper area needed to be redone. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Dinner at Savory was good, also. They do need a PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED sign because it's not clear where to go. Some customers sat, waited, and left because they were not waited on. The waitresses were moving quickly but couldn't keep up, it seemed. We'd stay there again."
NEUTRAL,"Location Parking and outside entrance In the heart of downtown Billings Upon arrival, I truely do no believe that this hotel is 3 star but 2 1/2 star is closer to reality. Room entrance is from the outside parking lot in an area that can have an undesirable element although patrolled by security. Rooms are fine and clean and towels are excellent. I would stay there again but there are better places in Billings."
POSITIVE,The hotel was clean and quiet. A short drive over the bridge gets you to the historic district. Beach access was directly across the street. The breakfast had a good selection. Would definately stay here again.
NEGATIVE,"Made reservations through priceline called hotel and confirmed with hotel and requested non-smoking room. I called and confirmed with hotel. Everything was confirmed ready to enjoy vacation. When i arrived at check in I was made to wait in line with others who were all told they had no rooms left and if we wanted we could go to another hotel They were quick to cancel my reservations but I still have not received a refund YET! DONT BE SURPRISE IF YOU DONT HAVE A ROOM WHEN YOU GET THERE Disliked: Service, Value"
POSITIVE,Arriving exhausted after a 16 hour trip from the UK..reception checked us in speedily..the room was adequate rather than sumptuous..but this was the least expensive hotel we stayed in during our visit. .Continental breakfast offered one of the best choices. two weeks later we stayed again at the end of our vacation..we were immediately remembered ( a nice feeling) .Later my wife was taken ill and required emergency hospital treatment..the desk called 911 and later helped when we needed to vacate quicly in order to catch our flight.
POSITIVE,Outstanding service. Always.
POSITIVE,"Each year I travel to Topeka with the Kansas Silent Film Festival and stay at this same hotel. Raj Gupta and his friendly staff always see to it that our needs are met and he goes above and beyond the ""call of duty"" to give us the best hospitality. The rooms are very clean, the linen is always fresh, and the Continental breakfast has fresh food on it each time I visit, no matter how long my stay is. Thank you! Room Tip: Although stairs can be a hassle, upstairs rooms are best. This was my first time staying in a downs..."
NEUTRAL,I did not have enough time to experience the hotel ammenities but i will say the pool was very nice. It has a fountain in the middle of it.
POSITIVE,"The cleanliness and room accommodations exceeded our expectations based on reviews we read. The staff was very friendly and always ready to answer any questions that we had. Being only 3 blocks from bouborn street was a plus. The only recommendation that we would make is that the parking fees be stated up front so as to not be a surprise.Pros: Great location, and great service. Cons: We were warned about our safety walking after dark."
POSITIVE,"The queen size bed is too small for two, you can sleep but it's not the confort you expect from an hotel like this"
NEUTRAL,"Good proximity to the beach, Restaurants nearby, conveniently near the historic town of St Augustine"
POSITIVE,"I stayed here when passing through on a business trip. I paid a little more than I would have liked at close to $70 but it was a nice, quiet hotel that felt really safe. The front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful and I was impressed that the property was so clean. The rooms were fairly standard, looking like almost every other hotel room in this price range. They bed was comfortable and the AC quiet. There was a little fridge and the standard amenities. Bath was clean. My room faced an empty field so that made it extra quiet. I was happy to see the windows actually opened as well, so I could let some fresh air in while I did some work in the evening. There are a couple of fast food type places near by and it is across the street from a lake. It was a little expensive for an off season hotel compared to other comparable ones on that route and the ""hot breakfast"" was dreadful: reheated frozen egg patties and sausage that I am pretty sure wasn't actually meat. I couldn't get mine choked down. There were cereal options though. That said, i would happily stay here again and recommend it because I felt safe and was able to get a nice quiet night of sleep. Room Tip: Ask for a room facing the back furthest from the highway for a nice quiet night."
POSITIVE,"We shared an appartment with some friends, it had great rooms, and a nice livingroom. The bathroom vas a bit old, but clean. Great breakfast, but the eating area was a little on the small side. Nice staff and a short walk from fifth. ave."
POSITIVE,I found this place a couple years back when we were going to be bringing my husband's grandmother and aunt to the city to sightsee. There were 6 of us (2 children). I searched for hours and days and stumbled across this hotel. I was so impressed!! We get to New York City about once a year and this is the only place I will stay!
POSITIVE,"On arriving in New York I was so excited to see the hotel and the 2 bedroom apartment we had booked at the Best Western, I had seen all the reviews on trip advisor previously and had high expectations! I Was NOT disappointed!! The welcome was warm and inviting, we arrived at 2pm an hour before check in and this was not a problem and was promptly checked in. Our apartment was on the 5th floor and when we walked in we was hit by how spacious it was it was lovely. 2 large double rooms one with a queen bed and one with a king bed. A spotlessly clean apartment, nothing to fault at all! The kitchen had everything you would need if you wanted to stay in and cook one night and a very nice touch of a hamper in the fridge (water, coffee, milk, crisps, popcorn). The bathroom also had some nice toiletries and there is a hairdryer there so no need to pack one! The staff were all so helpful no question or request was too much. Breakfast was continental style, fruit salad (on request) cereal, muffins, Danish pastries, bagels, toast, eggs... The best thing of breakfast the waffle maker! Genius idea and one everyone seemed to enjoyed! I note that people have commented on the noise, there is no doubt it is noisy but this is not a fault of the hotel, it's a city and it's always loud due to sirens etc. But the hotel across the road ( not naming any names!) they have their linen collected from times between 2300 and 0200 every night and that is the only thing that woke me every night due to the banging and crashing of the dust cart! But hey it's the city that never sleeps! Will recommend this hotel to all my friends going to New York. It is central to most things only a 10 min walk from the Rockefeller centre and Times Sq 5th avenue and St Patricks cathedral! Tour hop on off busses stop on Lexington avenue at junc with 49th which is where the hotel is so very convenient. Metro is the best way to get around and there is one of these across the road on 51st st two roads up! All round perfect location! Perfect hotel! Perfect holiday!!!!"
POSITIVE,"I love this place; it's hard to imagine going anywhere else now! When we arrived and saw the property we were speechless. We've stayed at places that claimed to be âocean frontâ, but this place is on the beach. The view from our room was amazing. For the price I thought there had to be something wrong but I was wrong. The room was great; the staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant has an ocean view and the food was excellent! Room service was great and the prices are fair. The aquarium is about 10 minutes away, we could see it across the bay from the hotel and when we went there we could see the resort. The pool, hot tub, and pool area are clean and welcoming. We had neighbors in both of the rooms next to us but never heard them through the walls, which was surprising because one was a family with kids. We're already planning two more visits to this resort - a family vacation with our teenage and adult children and granddaughter, and then another romantic getaway. After returning home from this trip I received a survey via email. I completed it and in response received a personal email from the Manager, Hugh Hedin, thanking me. I figured it was an automated response but when I read the email I realized it was written by a person! That's never happened. I feel like the staff at this resort all actually care about customer satisfaction and happiness. This was the cherry on top of an already wonderful getaway! Room Tip: I've only stayed in an ocean front room. The entire wall facing the ocean is comprised of huge..."
POSITIVE,When you walk into this BW you will think you are in a 5 star hotel. The lobby and gardens are absolutely beautiful. The ocean views are the best. The rooms are always clean and well appointed. The beds are extremely comfortable. Only minus is the resturant. The food was bad but there is plenty of other choices in the area to make up for that. I will stay here again.
POSITIVE,We stayed in adjacent rooms right on the beachfront. Waves crashing all night.... ah what a wonderful sound. Good friendly place to stay. Room service food was good too. Recommend this place. Brownies tea/coffee on arrival. How good is that!
POSITIVE,"The check in/ out was quick, easy, and very professional. We were helped with our luggage by a manager, Juan Ramirez, we felt very special. Juan was friendly, going out of his way to make us comfortable asking if he could make reservations in the restaurant, or if he/ his staff could bring us anything from the kitchen. The room was clean, and the huge TV won my Mom! Also the house keepers were almost invisible, but there with extra towels, which were the big fluffy ones, making our birthday trip very enjoyable. The ocean was steps away, birds across our window, a wonderful stay in a beautiful place! Room Tip: Ocean view, 2nd and up for the water, and the pelicans are eye level."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed in the handicapped room on the first floor--not requested--just assigned. the floor was so slippery after one shower that I almost crashed...could be really dangerous if your really were disabled. The hand held shower was impossible to switch from hand held to the shower head. We tried and tried, but, not possible. the breakfast room was hard to find. Breakfast was okay, nothing special."
POSITIVE,Great for the price. Convenient
POSITIVE,"This was my second stay at the Bedford Inn and I will be back whenever my travels take me through PA. Definitely the best pet-friendly option in the area. The room was spacious, yet there's also a cozy feeling, like you're in your den at home. The bathroom had two sinks which was really nice because I was traveling with someone and we could each spread out our stuff. Obviously this is not a high-class place, but it's comfortable, convenient, and clean. It's very nice to be able to walk a few feet to the restaurant, especially when the weather is bad. Dinner was delicious and reasonably priced...pints of Yuengling and BBQ ribs. The breakfast buffet and coffee were included in our rate -- a very good deal. (I will keep coming back for the French toast sticks.) My travel partner enjoyed chatting with the friendly staff while I walked my dog around the grounds. One more plus: there is ample truck parking if needed."
POSITIVE,"Great quality, great staff, good prices. We'll go there often.Pros: Convenience to restaurants/shops on Yonge/Eglinton."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for 3 nights-wish it could have been longer! The view from the very smart bedroom was of the beautiful beach and to wake up to see this every morning was a real treat! The restaurant was pricy, but the food great and the staff friendly and knowledgable. The grounds are beatifully maintained: one morning we watched the gardener as he laboured long and hard to remove a dead plant."
POSITIVE,"Don't be fooled by the exterior of this hotel. It looks like a high rise apartment and likely was at one time. The hotel staff are competent but the service wasn't exceptional You need your room key to go up the elevator which I like the added security. I've stayed in a few rooms including queen bed with a bathroom, sitting area, and a kitchenette with burners, microwave, and fridge. The other room was a 2 bedroom, bathroom, full kitchen with a stove and full sized fridge. The living room was big, with a sofa and tv. The larger room also had a tv. I really liked that there were temperature controls in both bedrooms and the living room. You can see into the office building across the street through the sheer curtains. The breakfast is enjoyable but you need your room key to get in. There's a selection of bread, english muffins, and pastries, fruit fresh and fruit salad, eggs, potatoes, and sausage (or bacon), cereal, waffle makers, selection of juices, coffee, and tea. The gym is in the basement and not heavy traffic. There are 2 treadmills, elliptical, bike, and weight machine. The free weights are in the sauna area. There are vending machines around, if you crave a late night snack. The location is close to restaurants, Safeway, and about a 10 min. walk from the train station. Room Tip: The 2 bedroom is great for up to 4 people if you don't mind sharing the bathroom. It's good value as typically cheaper than 2 rooms."
POSITIVE,"This property use to be a Days Inn, nowit is a BEST WESTERN PLUS!! Thank goodness. This property has been remodeled, updated, refreshened and ready for all of us to stay in a very comfortabl room. Mattresses are simply amazing! Room is very good size, with ample electrical outlets, microwave/ frig, flatscreen tvs an just overall everthing you would need! KUDOS to the staff here! Keep up the GREAT work and I will definately return to this property in ALTON, IL."
POSITIVE,Convenient parking near motel room. Updated bath fixtures. Comfortable bed. Pool area looked nice. Second door inside to hallway and pool area. Refrigerator / freezer in room.
NEUTRAL,"Hotel was fine but our group was very disappointed in the shuttle provided by Best Western from the airport to the hotel. We had to call 3 times before we were finally picked up at the airport. Each time we were told the shuttle was on it's way. We waited about 40 minutes and the driver seemed ""not quit with it"". His driving was very sporadic-once he just sat a what appeared to be a service entrance for the airport as if he expected the gate to open and let us in- which didn't happen. He than backed up and went a different way. He didn't appear to be very alert. Our flight arrived a little after 10:00 pm and we didn't get to the hotel until about 11:30 to 11:45."
POSITIVE,"excellent! The room we reserved and paid for in advance through Expedia was not available when we arrived because, they told us, they were 'overbooked'. We were then given an option of 'same-sized bed (King), with City View (parking lot) or two double beds with ocean view. We accepted the ocean view with two double beds. The staff worked with us as well as they could, given they had eighteen more reservations than they had rooms available. As a matter of fact, the hotel's own website said there were still Ocean View rooms with King beds as we sat in room 642. One wonders what would have happened if we had arrived later than we did. Would any rooms be available? If you are going to go out of your way to tell me my reservation is not refundable, you should have to play by the same rules and provide the room we reserved. It's not like we were Joseph and Mary arriving on a donkey, only to be told ""there is no room in the inn""."
NEUTRAL,"View of the bay Beds...too small and not comfortable. Felt like I was in the ocean. Convienent to many areas... airport, Tampa, Clearwater, St. Pete. etc. Hotel was at a great location and offered many amenities. However I was disappointed in the comfort of the beds and the overall decor. The decor should be upgraded. Pictures of the fitness room were decieving and was smaller than anticipated. Greatest asset was the view of the bay from the room and fitness center. One early morning someone tried to gain access to our room, thank goodness for the safety lock and they couldn't enter. Still am curious who was trying to enter the room. Staff was very friendly and issued new keys."
POSITIVE,"In town for a conference at the convention center. The drive was pretty much a straight shot with heavy traffic only once. The hotel was better than I expected for a Best Western but they put me on the city side, rather than the water, even though the hotel was nearly vacant. There were some minor maintenance issues (with the slider and adjacent wall paper) but it was clean, no bedbugs, and the staff was low-key and cordial. I don't know that my wife would care for it but it was fine for me and half the price of the in-town places."
POSITIVE,"Excellent place to stay and the price was reasonable. Could have been less noisy around 10pm but it wasn't bad. I would stay there again. Room was clean, shower worked well. plenty of space to hang clothes. The desk with the pull out was great for my laptop and the internet access was high speed. I don't think anyonw would be dis satisfied if they choose to stay here. The staff was very helpful and gracious."
POSITIVE,The front desk young woman went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable with our accommodation. The historical downtown location fit our itinerary. It was easy to get to other parts of Yuma as well as Mexico. The hot breakfast was made to order. We extended our stay another day. A good choice.
POSITIVE,"We stayed for a weekend with my son and daughter. Loved the hotel!!! Rooms clean, spacious and with a full kitchen. All the rooms are ocean front, what else can you ask.... The hotel staff amazing, everyone was very nice. Very close to the town so you walk there... Will go back again for sure :) One of the best hotels I have stayed on, feels like home away from home Room Tip: first floors are always the best ones! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Everything was wonderful! Property was clean, staff was friendly. And the location was perfect. Far enough from Times Square / pier that the beach was quiet but close enough to walk to all the restaurants and shopping. The breakfast was nice, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, muffins, yogurt and was constantly being restocked. The room was fantastic, full size fridge and drawers were stocked with utensils, including a wine bottle opener! King bed was comfy, bath was clean and shower had good water pressure. We loved the ocean view balcony (standard in ALL rooms). I can't think of anything issues! I was worried about noise because our room was directly across from the elevator but we didn't hear a sound. Thank you owners & staff for a wonderful vacation."
POSITIVE,"BEST WESTERN PLUS CottonTree, Sandy Utah We stayed three nights here in October, 2011. It is a 4 story hotel a short distance from Highway 15, but we were not bothered by traffic noise as long as the window remained closed. We had a fourth floor room across from the elevator, but were not disturbed by any noise from it. We had an average Best Western room with an average size TV. The room did not have a frig or microwave, but we called the front desk and they had a combination frig/micro sent to the room. The air conditioner took a long time to start. We thought it was broken, but it finally started. The maid forgot to leave coffee on the second day. A full, hot, breakfast is served in the lobby. It was very well done, but a separate room would have been much better. One thing I liked was the fresh pastries. They are very seldom part of the breakfasts served at hotels of this kind. Two sizes of waffles were offered in addition to eggs and breakfast meats. Four kinds of coffee were available and several types of juices. Lots of fresh fruits were also available. There was one computer in the lobby for guest use. The Internet connection was horribly slow. One of the desk clerks said they had three new ones on order, but was not sure when they would be installed. He said he was going to âwork onâ the computer to see if he could correct some of the problems, but it did not improve while we were there. It reminded me of the dial up connection I had on my first computer with four megs of ram. Slooowwww. Several restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel. We especially liked McGrathâs fish restaurant, which was about a block away. We ate two lunches there and they were both excellent and reasonably priced. This is a nice place to stay at a reasonable price and not too far from Salt Lake City or the mountain canyons. We were there to see fall tree color and made several trips into the mountains from this location. Driving up to the higher elevations took less than an hour."
POSITIVE,"Would like to see plastic dishes, a pitcher for drinks and a table on the deck. Otherwise a great place to stay."
POSITIVE,"Best value for money, big rooms, free internet, free breakfast, free parking, free shuttle to metro, great friendly and helpful staff. What more can you ask for. We have just come from the Roosevelt NY and best western place kicks their butt!"
NEGATIVE,Location Very basic accomodations; looks much better on website
POSITIVE,"Room clean, comfortable, a little overheated, great location, and a good breakfast."
POSITIVE,"I stay at the Best Western in Denison at least three days a week, i have stayed at many area hotels and the Best Western is by far the nicest, most comfortable that i have found. I have never had a complaint. The exercise facility is extremely nice and you will always find a hot breakfast. The staff is top notch, and always smiling, when i come in after a long day at work they always make me feel at home. The rooms are very spacious and always clean. The Best Western in Denison is my choice of area hotels and i highly recommend this hotel to everyone.N.Hale"
NEUTRAL,Shuttle bus was very useful. TV programs. We were expecting breakfast or at least coffee.
POSITIVE,Overall good experience.Pros: Employee(concierge) extremely motivated and helpful. Cons: Looked a bit run down.
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at the Best Western Riverside Inn in Macon several times, and have always found it clean and comfortable. I appreciate the convenient location, just off I-75, and not far from downtown Macon. The staff has always been friendly and helpful, and the free continental breakfast is a good way to start the day before hitting the road."
POSITIVE,"Just a great setup with brilliant accommodation! Set in a relaxed area of Paradise Island and close to the beach, I would recommend this hotel to everyone"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I were very satisfied with this hotel, particularly considering the rate charged. We would stay there again without hesitation."
NEUTRAL,"I stayed at the Best Western Plus Barons when I was in town on business. It was as you would expect, a Best Western, so nothing special and nothing wrong either. My room was clean and the free internet in the room was essential for my business needs, but I can't give the hotel a high recommendation because of the seemingly high price of $129 per night. Maybe Ottawa is an expensive place to stay, but this seemed too high a room night price for what I got!"
POSITIVE,"This is the best value for money hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a lot.Very clean,extremely pleasant and efficient staff,Nice sized comfortable rooms and superb value for money.Will definitely stay again next time I am in Orlando.All the complainers should go elsewhere,I would like to look in their homes."
POSITIVE,"A typical county town best western. Beds are comfortable and the breaky is typical continental style. Not noisy given it is on main street, but our room was at the back. Room Tip: Get a room at the back - not facing the main road."
POSITIVE,"Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel and would stay there again. My family and I stayed 5 nights in one room for a skiing week. The room with two queen beds was very good size and the beds had very good linens. Like others have said, the included breakfast was ample with eggs, sausage, waffles or pancakes, cereals, breads, muffins, fruit, juices and coffee. The breakfast room did fill up quickly at 7am on busy ski days. The underground parkade (love that Canadian word) was very convenient. The hotel is about a four block walk to the heart of Banff Avenue shopping and restaurants, so location is very good. The first night we stayed, there were at least three rooms close to us with dogs, so if the occasional bark or allergies are issues, ask for a room away from dogs. We never heard any barking during sleeping hours. Knowing that Best Westerns can vary widely in quality, this was a very nice experience. I would compare the quality directly to a good Marriott Courtyard (only with breakfast included) btw - our stay was also using points and a free night voucher, and the correct number of points were deducted. Also, from BW to Sunshine parking lot was less than 30 minute drive."
POSITIVE,"All things considering the area and for the hotel class it was a decent stay. The room was clean and comfortable. the area was great-close to the highway (right at the highway) shopping and eateries around the corner-The pool area was cool... Flat screen TV but DO NOT expect to be able to hook up any video (HDMI, Video, etc) to it as there are no ports for it.."
POSITIVE,They tried to charge me almost 30 more then booking cost
POSITIVE,We used the Best Western Oglesby Inn for our trip to Starved Rock State Park for a wedding. Our room was very clean and comfortable. In fact shortly after checking in we were called by the desk attendant to make sure our room was to our satisfaction. The hotel was full so it was a little crowded at breakfast but satisfactory.
POSITIVE,The only complaint we had was about the hangers! They would not hold anything - plastic clips would let loose and everything would fall down! Replace the hangers with more substantial ones.
POSITIVE,"We wondered if we had made a mistake when we drove into the area of this hotel. However, the hotel tuned out to be an excellent choice. Pick up at the airport by the hotel shuttle was quick, as was check in. We heard a woman ask if rooms could be rented by the hour as we were leaving the reception area. Rooms are entered from the outside and we walked to our room with some tredidation. However our room was exceptionally clean and recently renovated. Flat screen TV, microwave and refrigerator, free internet, quiet and effective air/heating system, quiet room in spite of facing a busy street and being on a flight path to LAX, and very comfortable bed made out stay very enjoyable. Three water sprinklers in the main room and one in the bathroom as well as a smoke detector showed concern for safety. Hotel shuttle bus was very accomodating, taking us back and forth to the car rental lots. Breakfast was very good - the usual waffles, fruits, cereals, yogurts, pastries. We went back to the hotel for the night before an early morning flight and were delighted to find fresh coffee and an assortment of muffins and pastries in the reception area well before the start of breakfast. The shuttle to the airport was waiting (less than 10 minute ride), and we were treated courteously by all. The only drawback we found was a lack of eating places within walking distance. We ate at a Roscoes Chicken across the street and the food was good, just not much variety. We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family!"
POSITIVE,We found the room to be very clean and well located. We had a view of the beach from our room and we were across the street from Kroger grocery store. Also on the other side was a mexican food restrurant. We were within walking distance of other restruants and activities. Pleasant stay. Good breakfast included.
NEUTRAL,"Very nice older lady at the front desk that helped us check in near midnight even when we had no reservations. Room was very small but tidy. Bathroom was too small and the halogen lights on ceiling were low and were emitting very strong heat! Felt like a heating lamp! Otherwise, location was not bad. Price was abit high considering our small room but was good enough just to sleep in. Hallways need upgrading. Breakfast was not bad! Nice eating area, but may need renovation instead of directing overflow to a different room down the hall! Probably would come back if necessary to stay in alderwood. Best Western is always a safe bet so far!"
POSITIVE,"Television, microwave and fridge were all older, but they worked. The room was CLEAN. Really clean. I've stayed in hotels which were much newer that weren't nearly as clean as this one was. Staff was friendly. The continental breakfast was o.k.. Nothing amazingly special, but it was there, and it was o.k. I'd definitely stay there again."
POSITIVE,Could have more items. There was no hot sauce even after asking front desk. Had to go to store down the street and buy some. TV system needs to be updated. There was no menu on screen to look at. Just had to click through channels. Plenty of hot water. Bed was comforable. Would use the hotel again.
POSITIVE,"I got the Tuscan king room for a sizzler rate . It was excellent. Also tried out the sauna and steam outside. Jacuzzi in room is good too. Clean rooms, flat TV with Cable. Had problem with wi-fi internet but the hotel manager gave me an ethernet cable so that worked out okay. location is good.noise levels were very low. Breakfast was much better than [?] other continental breakfasts elsewhere.Highlight were the waffle-maker.overall really good for the price ."
POSITIVE,"Great location for visiting ALL the wonderful wineries in the Dry Creek and Alexander Valley. Start the day with an awesome breakfast and be at the wineries upon opening. After a day of tasting, relax in the pool and comfortable pool area. Head on out at night to one of the MANY fabulous restaurants in Healdsberg within walking distance. Great location [?] and a great price too!"
POSITIVE,"Excellent experience, good neighbourhood, 10 minutes from downtown Charleston across bridge, excellent breakfast, reasonable price, will stay here again."
POSITIVE,The room was nice sized and in decent shape. The only complaints I had were the Whirlpool was smaller than I expected and it didn't have a stopper when we first got to the room. We had to call down for one. We also found hair on and in the whirlpool and the room seemed a bit pricey for it's location to me as well.
POSITIVE,Great place to stay for the cost! Everything looked good and was good. Appreciated the continential breakfast with many choices (was so much better than a higher price competitor was).
POSITIVE,"As a diamomd bw member I liked the added amenities-free breakfast, upgraded room and bonus points with stay."
POSITIVE,Easy access. Large clean room. Quiet and the beds were comfortable. Have stayed here twice and will again. Room Tip: Easy to get to and easy to get back on inter stater. Elevators are convenient. See more room tips
POSITIVE,"Had an enjoyable stay the staff was always very helpful and friendly the facilities were clean the rooms especially are well taken care of, and the complementary breakfast was awesome."
POSITIVE,"I used this hotel for overnight between planes. Room was clean, reasonably appointed and bed was comfortable. Next door is a good Italian restaurant which was handy so I did not have to look for a place to eat. Continental breakfast was included and was satisfactory, nothing special but did the trick when you just want to eat and get back to the airport quickly. Staff friendly, check-in and out prompt. Close to the airport with good shuttle service. I will stay here again when I have to stay near the airport."
POSITIVE,"We recently went to and from Los Angeles with an overnight stay in Toronto. We booked the Best Western Plus Hotel, Toronto Airport directly on-line with excellent results. This was the hotel on Eglington West - note that there is another Best Western nearby on Dixie Rd. They provide free airport shuttle (10 mins) between 4 am and midnight. The staff members were very friendly and helpful. There is a business centre available for e-mails and printing boarding passes, as well as an exercise room with whirlpool, and laundry room. The establishment is very clean throughout. They also offer free breakfast in the morning. There is a private restaurant attached to the hotel where we had a very pleasant meal. It is called Michele and offers an Italian menu at reasonable prices. The room was excellent. Very roomy with all amenities and an excellent bed; it is very quiet even so near the airport runways. The room included a microwave oven and a large bar fridge. Of note, you need to book the morning shuttle to the airport on arrival as they are very busy in the morning. We left off on the first shuttle and it was full with other people waiting. On our return north our flight was cancelled and we had to skip our stop at the hotel. We will return next trip as it is first class."
POSITIVE,"Spending the might in Mojave was not at all on my Bucket List, but when wild fires forced us from our home, and all the hotels in Tehachapi were filled with fire-fighters (bless their hearts), our closest option was the Best Western in Mojave. I did not have very high expectations, frankly. Having said that, you can probably guess that I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all, the lovely young lady in reception was smiling and cheerful and quite sympathetic to our plight. We had spent the previous night not sleeping at all in our van and I asked her if we could get a room well away from the highway. (Highway 14 gets very heavy truck traffic.) She was able to accommodate our wish and we had a room (407, I think) in a part of the hotel that is actually a separate building from the main one. The room was very clean and was as well appointed as any BW I've been in. There was a fridge in the room and a microwave. The WiFi connection was very good. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this BW. We had a nice breakfast in the hospitality room, with hot foods including waffles, sausage, and bacon, as well as the usual fare. Perhaps it was because we were so exhausted, but I slept very peacefully and never once heard traffic noise from Highway 14.. There are also train tracks on the other side of the highway and I didn't hear one train either. Don't be put off by the looks: this is a very nice place to spend the night. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the highway, in the separate building at the back of the property. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"In September when returning our son to university, we stayed at the Best Western. We have stayed at this hotel several times over the years (when it was the Ramada) and have always enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice and large and clean. It is close to the university and to the mall and has a nice complimentary breakfast. The only thing lacking is a dining room. We had dinner in the small bar which only holds a few people. Another plus is the discount when one is staying because of bringing students to university. We will definitely be making reservations to stay there again in December."
POSITIVE,"This hotel grew on me. We arrived after 20 hours travelling to find that the agents (not the hotel) had messed up our booking so that rather than the room with 2 beds that we'd requested we were shown to a quite small double. However the hotel were happy to move us to one with 2 queen beds, as well as a fridge, microwave and coffee maker, this was much more comfortable for a 7 night stay. I liked the facilities - the laundry room was really useful with 2 washers and 2 dryers. We used the penthouse gym (with the adjacent roof terrace) every day and although we didn't borrow bikes they were available to use for free. We loved the White Spot restaurant and went there for breakfast and dinner. Although it's not the hotel restaurant it may as well be as it's attached and opens into the hotel lobby. The free shuttle bus is 'on demand' and will take you to wherever you want to go downtown - so we had arranged a transfer to our cruise ship (for the next week) but other passengers were just using the shuttle. The area is a little run down but I never felt uncomfortable or worried and within 2 minutes walk it becomes much more swish. We loved Vancouver. I'm sure there are better hotels, but they'll come at a price and this was more than adequate for our needs."
POSITIVE,"The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends."
NEUTRAL,The location worked well for visiting our daughter at college and getting around San Diego. The wall heater/AC did not work but the weather was comfortable during our visit. Always nice to have a free breakfast and free parking.
POSITIVE,"I found the staff helpful, the motel clean and quiet, and the morning breakfasts were well prepared. This motel was just a hop and skip from the convention center and to other attractions. would definately use it again."
POSITIVE,"The Longbranch hosted our two-day Toastmasters convention in November 2011. It was a nice location for a group of our size-- about 80 people. The staff wasy helpful and accommodating during the planning stages of the event- were very willing to work with us on special setups for displays, seating arrangement, etc. The dining servers were prompt, friendly and attentive. The nice thing about this convention center is that they have various sizes of meeting rooms, from seating for 25 up to probably 125. In one of the larger rooms there is a nice stage, which was very handy for our speech contests. The food was tasty and the portion sizes were satisfying. The sleeping rooms were clean and quiet-- ours was close to the convention rooms-- others were farther away in a separate building reached via skywalk. But I think the hotel made great efforts to give our attendees the closer rooms. There is a nice pool and exercise room, and a substantial breakfast buffet. My only complaint about this hotel is one I have at many convention sites-- no recycling program. Lots of plastic cups, paper and cardboard in the waste baskets. So overall, this is a good place to have a small to medium sized convention. You'll have the full attention and assistance of the staff. Room Tip: Let the registration desk know if you want to be near the pool or exercise room."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel just appears to be a little tired. No on site restaurant or bar. Regular pool is outdoors, which it didn't say. They hadf a guy there trying to sell condo's next door, who was a little pushhy."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed 1 night during our last day in Florida, we appreciated the roomsize, easy access from the free parking area at the hotel, free WIFI, easy to find the hotel from way 95. The Continental breakfast (included) was better than we expected. Staff was nice and friendly. For the price paid we will reccomend a stay at this hotel."
POSITIVE,"The room was very nice, clean, and affordable."
POSITIVE,"Modern facility with courteous and helpful, friendly staff."
NEUTRAL,"room was updated and renovated. clean room. Front Desk stuff was nice. breakfast area was okay. but we enjoyed what they offered. simple continental breakfast with waffle maker! its conveniently located close to airport and its only 5 minutes drive to the strip too. but there was noise problem, and airplane noise woke me up early morning... I will recommend this place for people leaving to airport next day. without noise, it was pretty good for what you are paying."
NEUTRAL,"My biggest complaint was that you could hear every footstep from the person staying above your room. It was very, very annoying when you are trying to get a peaceful rest and you hear clomping above, which you can do nothing about! Probably won't stay here unless I get a top floor room. Then I would."
POSITIVE,"This is a great place to stop for the night if you have work to do. Internet connection is fast and stable. Room is small, but its clean, and the bed is comfortable. Verizon has 4G in this area, but the connection wasn't very good. Internet connection in my room was good on wifi, and the room is wired, as well, though I would have had to have my own cable or would have been required to have a $25 deposit for a 6ft piece of CAT5e. Walking distance to Outback, a sushi place, and a bowling alley that has 40 beers on tap. Not bad! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location"
NEGATIVE,"A nice motel, but our ground-floor room was very damp, probably due to flooding during the 2004 hurricane."
POSITIVE,Very clean and spacious rooms. Staff were very courteous and our room was prepared in time for our arrival.
POSITIVE,Perfect for the avid snowmobiler. Hotel is located right on the trail.
NEGATIVE,"The hotel is extremely old and run down, the rooms are not very insulated so the entire stay I was constantly hearing the rooms around me, I could clearly hear conversations happening in the next room even with all doors closed, granted the woman was raising her voice, it still was clear. Doors slamming at all hours of the night and the ENTIRE hotel stinks like cigarettes and cigars. Even in my ""non-smoking"" room, the smell of smoke was very heavy. Beds were super uncomfortable and the staff couldn't care less about your happiness. I go to Columbus every year for the Arnold Classic and I will NOT be staying here again, nor will I recommend anyone of my many friends who go every year to stay there. There are PLENTY of other hotels in Columbus to stay at. Pros: Nothing Cons: Everything Location: Only positive thing is there is a gym and pool right next door that is free if you stay at the hotel. Not worth staying there again just for that."
POSITIVE,Price was kind of high.
POSITIVE,"I thought the hotel was decent. I first stayed in a Best Western Suites Hotel near DC on a layover and was very impressed. Best bang for the buck. The LAX location wasn't in tip top shape, but it was good enough for a one night stay. Hotel staff was very friendly, shuttle was timely. The only gripe: If you rely on the Internet for your job, and youÂ are a business traveler. Don't hold your breath. Complementary wireless is only good if it actually works."
POSITIVE,"Pros: The hotel staff was very friendly, recognizes repeat customers, and is very helpful."
NEGATIVE,"We were extremely disappointed from the check in moment onwards. We reserved 2 rooms with 2 names (as suggested by the Rep that took our reservation) and when we checked in they couldn't find the 2nd reservation because of the way it was entered in the computer. The bathroom had an empty toilet paper roll - there was no kleenex in the room so I let the front desk know and he said he'd bring it right up. We never did receive it. The bathroom had dirty stain marks in it. The website said it was 5 minutes from Muckleshoot Casino, but it was approx 10 - 12 minutes. We used the shuttle to go to Muckeshoot and when we wanted to come back to the hotel, we had to wait over 25 minutes. The front desk staff were not professional at all. They had very little professionalism but were friendly. The complimentary buffet was very poor quality. Overall it was a disappointment and we will not stay there again and will also tell everyone we know not to stay there."
POSITIVE,"We've stayed at this Best Western 5 times...twice over Christmas with other family members in nearby rooms. Staff members have always been helpful and courteous and our rooms large, clean, quiet and nicely appointed. Even my sister's pet friendly rooms were in good shape and fresh smelling and the pet rate was reasonable. The on-site restaurant is a plus for our family because we're all breakfast eaters. We're happy to pay a few dollars for freshly prepared sausage and eggs or a stack of hot cakes with good quality coffee and juice instead of feeling obligated to eat cold cereal and packaged pastries because they're ""free."" As others have noted, this is a nicely landscaped, established property that features comfort more than glitz. Compared to several other Santa Rosa properties, we think it's a find, which is why I'm on the site now to reserve for Christmas 2011. Room Tip: We like the rooms at the back of the property because they've been quiet. Those by the pool are pleasant. Avoid rooms close to the front of the property and be sure to be clear if you can't handle stairs. There are no lifts to the second floor."
POSITIVE,"Our love affair with the Mezona began several years, when we drove into Mesa without having made advance motel reservations. Being from Minnesota and recently retired, our plan was to stay in the area for a month or so. We looked over a couple of other motels, before deciding on the Mezona. We were going to give it a try for a night or two, and then move on if we didn't like it. That was ten years ago, we are still coming back, and would not consider staying anywhere else. The number of returning guests have become our good friends, and we look forward to seeing and spending time with them each year during our stay at the Mezona. The entire staff is friendly and courteous. We love the spacious rooms, complete breakfasts, and the nearby restautants and museums. It's a great place to stay. Room Tip: We always choose the poolside rooms, either upper floor or downstairs and never been disappointed."
NEGATIVE,"Everything was fine until we went to bed, the fitted sheets became untucked and it was like sleeping on sandpaper."
NEUTRAL,"When we arrived at approx 10:30pm our reservation for 1 King bed at $97 could not be found. There was a vacancy so we were offered 2 Queens for $115. In the morning when we checked out they had found our reservation and we were offered the $97 rate. We were only partially pleased in that they had found our reservation, but it was not for the room/rate that we had reserved. The staff need training on looking for reservations for booking.com."
POSITIVE,Convenient to Opryland and downtown.
POSITIVE,"Will come back again!!Pros: Clean, nice, good location. Cons: The breakfast is the same everyday."
NEGATIVE,"Hotel was clean and comfortable but service was lacking. Had to hunt for plug ins for the vehicle, not many available. TV remote did not work, so left a note the first day (stayed 4) and the following days but it was never fixed. Last day did not get maid service. Called front desk when I returned to my room at 10 pm and asked for more towels but they never came."
NEGATIVE,"The room was ok for the price. Location is not that great. From the reviews we expected the breakfast to be good. But the milk tasted bad, fruit was stale and atleast few days old and pancakes were dry."
POSITIVE,Good value for the money near my conference venue All was up to my expectations
NEUTRAL,"The location was great. Quoted a great price by booking ahead but was dissapointed when checking out. They were helpful with directions when needed. Quiet and rooms very soundproof. Our booking #221380304 for 2 rooms quoted prices of $63,20 each night for each room. When room #2 checked out their bill totaled $366.63 and our room was $96,89. I'm not getting the difference in cost for the two rooms booked at the same time for the same price. No added charges for room#2 was added. We only stayed 10/07 and 08 (2 nights) Best Western said no problem checking out 1 day early.Not sure if this is a issue with booking.com or the hotel. Also just wished breakfast area was larger to handle the guests."
POSITIVE,You cant't get much closer. To Six Flaggs than this. The drawback it is along side the Freeway. Rooms facing the freeway can be noisy. It was clean and well maintained.
POSITIVE,"Pros: Spacious rooms, excellent continental breakfast and good location near highways. Cons: Room smelled like feet."
POSITIVE,This hotel is obviously older and has been remodeled. There are cheaper places to stay in town but we've heard from friends that they are not the best. We've stayed at this hotel three times and will stay again.
POSITIVE,"This is great only a short walk to the beach and ""little venice"" which is not very well known for a visitor. Easy free parking and very helpful and friendly staff. Would certainly go and stay again"
POSITIVE,"I admit I'm a bit jaded and I don't usually stay at Best Western Properties. But my client booked this hotel for me on a recent visit to LA. This is a great find, and I'll stay here again when in LA, even with my family. The staff is really friendly, breakfast is good, the rooms are clean and cheerful. Not to mention free parking and wifi."
POSITIVE,"We had a wonderful stay. The staff were very approachable and friendly. The rooms were spacious and clean. Outdoor areas close to the rooms made our stay with another family very social and relaxing after days sight seeing. As I work in the industry I was very impressed that the entrance and many rooms (no hand held showers) are wheelchair accessible. The design is such that you would not notice that you had an accessible room. The complimentary breakfast and arrival cookie are a lovely touch. The only down side is the location, for a visit to LA it is a long way from a lot of the sights (but everywhere is in LA)."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel for a great price. The front desk staff was very friendly and willing to help us with directions around the area. We enjoyed the continental breakfast as well. The rooms were updated and clean. We had a king size room which faced the street which was a bit noisy but, not too bothersome. We loved the location of the hotel which is very close to many nice restaurants and shops. We are definitely planning on staying here again! Room Tip: King room faced the street. A little noisy but, didn't keep us awake."
POSITIVE,"I just wanted to take a moment to tell you about the great service and hospitality we received from the Maintenance guy Rudy. If all companies had an employee like him, the world would be a better place. I just canât say enough about how he went above and beyond on anything we asked of him. I will certainly stay there whenever we come to Marina Ca to visit my mother near the Inn. Whenever your ready to leave there you have my number, you deserve to get paid way more for what you do."
POSITIVE,"Overall a great little place to stay. The hotel had recently had a makeover and some renovations. The beds were pretty comfortable and the TVs were good. The location and small parking lot would be my only complaints, but overall a great little place to stay.Pros: Newly remodeled lobby with nice flat screen TVs in the rooms. Cons: Location was hard to get to and the parking lot was small."
NEUTRAL,"Please up grade the bathroom lines, the towels were small, dingy, scratchy and thin. Not at all the usual standard on a Best Western member."
NEGATIVE,"Close to Newark Airport with Shuttle service to and fro. Reasonable price. The first room we were assigned smelled so bad of body odor that we had to ask for another room. The food in the restaurant was nearly inedible, I.E. my wife's chicken was processed much like a patty and rolled into a wrap, my hamburger deluxe was frozen and tasted it. Also, if you are driving from the nyc area and are trying to find this hotel - good luck!"
POSITIVE,The ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and nice. They did't have fake smiles they were real and were ready and willing to help me. I was in from out of town and they were more than willing to answer any questions I had. They made my hotel stay a wonderful one.
POSITIVE,Excellent Hotel. Best Beds and pillows found in our world travels. Very freindly staff and great hotel overall
POSITIVE,The hotel is older yet very clean and well maintained. I had a wonderful stay there and the breakfast was fantastic!
NEGATIVE,the worst Best Western we have ever stayed at. Overpriced. Needs reno.
POSITIVE,"Comfort Lower quality soaps and toletries Good spot since it was convenient to downtown Madison, the airport, shopping and resturants. The king bed gave me a great sleep which is abnormal when I travel. The price of the room was reasonable and the included breakfast was bonus."
POSITIVE,The staff at this hotel were fabulous very accomodating and were there to assist in any way that they could It may the stay very pleasurable.The only one thing that we did experience is house keeping knocking on all doors at 9am and earlier each morning. For travellers this was a little hard to take as it was hard to sleep throughOther than that is was very enjoyable.
POSITIVE,"My wife and I came to Florence for a NYE party and just needed a place to crash. It was very nice for what we needed. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The room was large, with a couch and mini refrigerator and microwave. The continental breakfast was good with the basic breads, pastries and juices. The only issues that we had was that our shower clogged."
POSITIVE,"I am the mother of an 18year old and we traveled by ourselves to this great location. The lodge was close to all bus connections to the mountains and shops,we felt very safe and the staff at hotel were very friendly.The lodge was warm and beds very comfortable and cozy.The breakfast was very good and adequate for our needs.Pros: Loved the location close to bus to go to mountains and felt safe. Cons: No drying room for smelly boots."
NEGATIVE,"I spent two out of three reserved nights at the Best Western Inn in Chickasha, OK last weekend. Two days with NO hot water, 4 calls to management, finally broken plumbing forced me to check out and end my trip early. I checked with other guests in the building and they were complaining too. Awful, terrible, just drive on by! Room Tip: Sleep in your car at a truck stop rather than stopping here. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"For those like us who don't think of Best Westerns as upscale, this property will completely change your mind. Located behind a Ruby Tuesdays, gas station, and Waffle House, it is, quite literally, a hidden gem. Stepping inside, you would think you are in a W hotel or other fancy property sporting modern, clean, minimalist decor. Our room was huge and well-appointed, with dark wood furniture, separate sitting area with a large sofa and large flat screen TV, and an incredibly comfortable bed. The hotel is new and well-kept, and even has a new hotel smell. The fitness room was well-equipped and the indoor pool was spotless. The front desk staff was very friendly. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The complimentary breakfast isn't that extensive, but is adequate, and the sitting area was being cleared and cleaned continuously. Plenty of parking and easy access to I-70 and charming downtown New Bern (we had an amazing dinner at Chelsea's, which never disappoints). Excellent value for the price. Highly recommended."
POSITIVE,"The room was very nice, the bed was comfortable, there was no ambient noise from the hallway or parking lot, the staff was friendly, the price was good for the quality, the breakfast could use improvment . . . but it smelled like cat pee.. yuck"
POSITIVE,"The staff made this a stand-out--from the new and eager-to-please evening clerk, to the morning clerk who printed out some essential files for me when the lobby computers were down, to the housekeeper who cheerfully refreshed my room despite having to work long hours overtime. The hotel had been completely full the night before my arrival--an event of some sort--and all staff members, especially the housekeepers, were exhausted. The place did not smell as good as it looked, and the grounds needed attention, but I suspect that this was not the usual condition of the property. On another night this property might have warranted an ""excellent"" (for this class of accomodation) rating. The staff certainly were five star folks! Room Tip: Some interior rooms have pleasant view of courtyard. On the far end, the view is of the pool."
NEUTRAL,Nice Simple hotel for good value. Close to the big mall and airport. Easy access to everything. Room was clean. Shower was awsome.
NEUTRAL,I have been staying atVPI for some time and I really enjoyed the underground parking. Now they charge for it. As a result I may relocate!
POSITIVE,"It was a nice location close tot he sea. Great for walking along the coast. Fre car park and hifi. Great breakfast, used the Featgers Bar for meals. Good experience."
NEGATIVE,Stayed there last month. Horrible experience!!!! Hair on bed sheets that I didn't even bother sleeping in. Called front desk for toothbrush and fresh blanket & sheers and it never came. Called the front office several times throughout the night and not a single answer.. Bobby pin found in between the sheets. This hotel is a JOKE
POSITIVE,"Welcoming staff. Upgraded us to the beach side. Close to everything- Wharf, Cannery Row, Aquarium, downtown. Nice and quiet. Great lounge."
NEUTRAL,"The location at the beach is just perfect! There are a few things I need to mention here: 1. Too bad that the pool and hot tub are facing the parking lot rather than the ocean. 2. The breakfast isn't as great as the view you get from the restaurant. The potatoes and eggs from two out of four breakfast plates were cold. 3. Surprisingly, they don't rent [?] or sell surfboards or body boards and the next rental is far away. 4. I was really surprised about the additional 15$ parking fee I had to pay at the check out. The staff didn't mention it at all while checking in. They said it should be noted in my email reservation, but it wasn't. They gave other arguments for the parking fee which didn't make sense. Since this is the last impression I got from the hotel, It leaves a bitter aftertaste."
POSITIVE,I have stayed at this Best Western several times. It's half way to my brother's house and very clean and friendly. Tonight Bobbie at the front desk was especially nice. It was a long day on the road and she was very helpful!
POSITIVE,We went fir the outlaw races and the convince of location was great
NEUTRAL,The hotel is definately not new but their is an ongoing effort to present a well maintained face to the hotel. Overall a good value with everything needed for my visit.
POSITIVE,Liked everything about it with the exception of the bathroom.Pros: Loved the bed room very spacious. Cons: Bathroom didn't look like it had been cleaned...toilet was nasty.
POSITIVE,I would stay here again. If you coming in later like I was need some place clean then it the place to stay. Great breakfast that morning.
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Heritage Inn hit the spot as a beginning to a 5000 mile roadtrip. Even though it is a large property with 2 floors, there were lots of entrances so unpacking the car was a snap. The recently renovated room with a built inn cabinet for the fridge and microwave was very soothing and relaxing. A good hot breakfast buffet was available with someone refilling the coffee cups. It was only a short drive to do some shopping. And the indoor pool area was was lovely with lots of greenery. In short, not in a scenic area along the Missouri River but it hit the spot!"
POSITIVE,Our stay was nice. Great restauraunts nearby and a walking path. Pros: Close to shopping and places to eat Cons: Stairs Location: Close to freeway
POSITIVE,"What a wonderful surprise. We weren't sure we'd selected the right place to stay, based on Internet searches. But when we arrived we found a neatly prepared room with a large private bath. It got better! Out the door we walked 100 ft. to River Street where we spent our mornings and evenings shopping and dining. Two blocks away is the City Market, great food, live music and horse drawn carriages. We loved it and plan to return to do it all over again."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at this hotel while visiting family over the Christmas holiday. The rooms were very spacious, staff was amazing and breakfast was very good! I look forward to staying with you the next time we are in town!"
POSITIVE,"This is a lovely lovely inn. It has all the charm of a bed and breakfast, but the convenience and privacy of a hotel. The owners are very friendly and warm and call you by your first name. They seem genuinely interested in knowing your experiences including where you went to dinner and whether it was any good. The breakfast is outstanding as are the home made cookies after dinner. I give it my highest recommendation!"
POSITIVE,"We picked this hotel because of the price and only the price. Best Western has never disappointed me in the past and this time was no different. The room was small but we didn't visit Flagstaff to sit in the hotel room. The bed was comfortable and the decor was nice. The woman at check in was less than friendly but everyone else we came across who worked [?] there was nice. The breakfast room was better than expected too. The only disappointing thing about the hotel was the pool. They boast about an indoor pool which we were excited about. What they don't mention is that the pool is in another building, separate from the hotel. So yes, we could've gone swimming but we would've had to walk back through the cold and snow, dripping wet, to get back to our room. So we skipped the pool. Other than that, this hotel was better than what we had anticipated for the price we paid."
POSITIVE,This is a great hotel. The room was clean & the bed was very comfortable.
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here from Sept 9th 2011 for 3 nights as part of our 30th wedding anniversary celebration. Our corner room with king size bed (very comfy) and city view had a safe, mini-fridge, microwave, LCD TV, small balcony with two chairs and free wifi. The bathroom though small was clean and modern. The free breakfast offered in the lobby area includes waffles, cereal, toast, fruit, hot/cold beverages. There is a small pool, nice to sit around after a morning down at the beach which is a leisurely ten minute walk away. Complimentary coffee and lemonade is provided in the lobby as are beach towels, newspapers and wifi. We have stayed in Aqua boutique hotels in Waikiki before and I would say this is one of their better hotels. The price was reasonable and I have nothing to moan about!"
POSITIVE,"My family stayed at the Coconut Waikiki and found the rooms to be very comfortable (best hotel bed I have slept in, and I travel ALOT!). We had the larger room (408) and the two bathrooms were great to have for a family. There was also a little kitchenette, in-room safe, and you can get towels from the Front desk for the beach. What was great was the breakfast down in the lobby every morning - cereal, little pastries, bread for toast, fruit, eggs, sausage, and waffles. When we came back from the beach in the afternoon, there were 2 or 3 kinds of ice water, juice or flavoured iced tea for guests, which was perfect! Close to buses, restaurants, and 7 minute walk to the beach. Very friendly staff, computers and a printer in the lobby to print bus routes or boarding passes, and eco-consious (air conditioners and tv only work when you put your room card key into the slot next to your hotel room door - figured it out day 2!). Room Tip: Larger rooms are on the street and a bit noisy - if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed at this hotel because of recommendations of a friend. This hotel has great staff, a decent free breakfast, and easy access to walking along the canal and catching buses. Comfortable beds, good tv, computers and beverages in the lobby 24/7 was a nice plus. Good sized"" in room"" safe. Super clean and well renovated, but can still smell ""old"". The cons would be: pool is small and not much sun hits it, so didn't use it, our room was very small and had no dresser, the air conditioner was placed on floor level that blew cold air on the side table, and cut in and out several times a night and was noisy (we didn't complain). the coffee maker was in the bathroom and the plug in was on the opposite wall, which was inconvenient. If you want to spend more time at the beach, then stay closer as it was a long walk every day. I think the hotel should limit children on using the computers for playing games, as sometimes it was difficult to get on them. We won't be staying here again, but neither will we be going to Honolulu. Room Tip: Ask for an upgrade if they have them. Also ask to be up above the 7th floor as it is quieter."
POSITIVE,"excellent value,nice continental brekkie included, mountain/canal view is ok...other side is crappy condo.view.(room 610 where we were)..... but rooms were great..good bathroom..good beds..very clean and well maintained...easy 15 min walk to beach..5 mins to shopping...would definately return...very very good staff..good free wi-fi...well done coconut waikiki"
POSITIVE,"I had reservations regarding this hotel, but it turned out to be very nice, clean & we had a great time walking around the area & to the ball came at Wrigley Field. It is a very beautiful & quaint place. Hard to spot by driving by as we missed it the first time. Love the vines crawling up the front of the building.Pros: Very clean. Walking distance to locals & Wrigley Field. Nicely decorated. Good breakfast food. Cons: We liked it all but thought the steps coming in could be a little dangerous, but all in all it is very nice."
NEUTRAL,"Fairly close to downtown, reasonably priced, good parking, room with all needed facilities Too far from city center for easy cycling"
POSITIVE,Very impressed with staff and comfort.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for the start of cycling the P'tite Train du Nord trail. Very comfortable, clean. Helpful front desk staff."
NEUTRAL,"The room was clean enough and the building was not in terrible condition but the location was not what I would suggest for a weekend tourist. Not walking distance from the action of downtown and no close sites to make the distance worthwhile. Should not be advertised as a ""Downtown"" location- ""midtown"" at best."
POSITIVE,A very enjoyable stay. The location was beautiful with chocolate lake behind the hotel. The restaurant on site was well priced the food was delicious and the serve was friendly. They also have a chocolate lab on site who is the mascot for the hotel and he is friendly and sweet. The room was clean and comfortable to allow myself to unwind and relax at [?] the end of my day. The hotel is also very close to downtown Halifax and is near very beautiful parks on the waterside.
POSITIVE,"I'm checking out this morning after a 5 night stay. As usual it's all good. This hotel serves up a good conti breakfast from 6:30-9:00. The hotel is across the street from Super store. Within a block there are a number of places to eat at. The parking here is very good. Plus easy access to the highway. The staff here are friendly and always with a smile. Good job Northgate Inn. ""I will be back"" Room Tip: The baked ravioli at 'Little Georges' is amazing!!"
POSITIVE,"Great view, very clean, nice room, great staff. Heated pool was a little on the cool side. Breakfast provided was excellent!"
POSITIVE,"Pros: The price, the clean room, the friendly staff. Cons: The mattress on one bed was not good. the other bed was fine."
POSITIVE,"As I drive to Atlantic Canada, my first stop is in Edmundston. I've stayed at many hotels in Edmundston, and Riviere-du-Loup, and this is by far the best of the bunch. The lobby is nice, although I am not a fan of the decor. It resembles the decor at the Days Inn in Edmundston. I believe it is owned by the same person / family. The room was big and clean, with a nice sized bathroom. I really like the fact that you can open the windows to get some fresh air. All the modern amenities are available in your room. The breakfast was very good with lots of choices. It is located right across from the hospital. Edmundston is not a pretty town, but I was very pleased with this new hotel ! Room Tip: You can ask for a room on the ground floor and park your car right in front of your door."
POSITIVE,size of room cleanliness air conditioning did not cool whole room
POSITIVE,"Pros: Friendly staff, beautiful pool area, love the birds. Cons: Major smoking all over room walkways, ashtrays along all walkways, so intense it comes into the room."
POSITIVE,"If you want a nice hotel with great amenities in a quiet location of NYC, stay here. You get a refrigerator, free wifi, continental breakfast and warm cookies. Near the South Street seaport - very quiet location - don't hear the subway or honking of horns. It's about a 15 minute walk to the nearest subway stops - but multiple stations on various lines so easy to walk to. About 1/2 mile from Chinatown and great restaurants. Great view of the Brooklyn Bridge. One of the favorite hotels in NYC - away from the chaos that you find in most areas in NYC. If this is your first trip to NYC it maybe too far from a subway stop - but I highly recommend this hotel and location. Friendly staff too."
POSITIVE,"We travel to NYC about once a month from North Carolina and Seaport Inn has become our only place to stay in the City! We have been staying here for a couple of years now and the location, staff and terrace rooms are fantastic! Suheidy Estevez has been at the front desk each time we visit and always remembers us by name, where we like to visit, my husband's favorite cookies and has a true heart for serving others. While I mention Suheidy by name, I have to say that every member of the staff at this quaint hotel is fantastic!!! The Seaport neighborhood is wonderful to walk around after working all day. There are great little restaurants, wine shop and activities going on. The Pier is nice for an early morning walk and/or Tai Chi. We look forward to our next visit... next week! Room Tip: Terrace rooms are fantastic! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"The staff is excellent and the rooms are old, but well maintained and furnished. Best of all, the property is clean. The internet was fast, the bed comfortable, and everything worked well, including the shower, which was great. I ate in the restaurant and enjoyed the cob salad. Although I like the Comfort Inn around the corner is newer and nicer, the price is $25 more. The location is excellent as it is across the street from the airport. Give it a shot."
POSITIVE,I will stay there again.They should invest in some extra pillows though..but overall it was great!!:)
POSITIVE,"My wife and I just got back from our annual winter escape to Grand Marais. We've stayed at the Best Western a few times, but I thought I should finally write a review. We've always found this to be a very welcoming property. Rooms are clean and well kept, the continental breakfast is quite nice(although the summer addition of the Worlds Best Donuts is even better) and the location is great for convenient exploration of the town. After multiple stays at the best western, I can definitely recommend it as a great base camp for a stay in GM. Staff are friendly and helpful, the views of the lake are great, the beach out front offers great rock picking, and the HUGE hot tub is a great place to retreat after a day of skiing along the Gunflint Trail!"
NEGATIVE,This Best Western should not have a Plus designation. This property games the new rating system by offering a breakfast at an adjacent restaurant that does not meet the standard of even a most basic breakfast served in the most basic hotels. Room Tip: Insist on an updated room (in back) which was only offered upon request.
POSITIVE,"Nice big, clean room with all the usual amenities, good wireless connection ( free), straight across the Georgia Southern University campus. Highly recommended for attending a conference at GSU. I was particularly impressed that I was given a lower price upon arrival than the one I had reserved the room for online!"
POSITIVE,"I was a great hotel and would love to stay there on my next trip.Pros: Location, my coffee pot did not work."
NEUTRAL,Good location across the road on beach. Near some good restaurants and easy drive to the city of St. Augustine.
NEGATIVE,"This hotel has potential with nice staff in the restaurant/bar, but not clean at all, the bathroom needs maintenance.Pros: Location. Cons: Not well-kept, not clean, toilet paper in the hallways, cigarette butts near the entrance."
POSITIVE,"At Priceline prices, the Hotel was great...clean, well kept,felt secure. During a summer trip I could see the pool & adjacent green way as a great advantage.Pros: The hotel was clean and looked well kept.small banquet rooms had unique architectural features. Cons: Front desk staff NOT as friendly, though competent, as restaurant staff."
POSITIVE,"Excellent staff, so friendly, 4th floor amazing sunsets. Full views of the bay, walking distance to all resturants and dock bars. Indoor heated pool and Hot tub. Free fresh popcorn 24/7. I will always stay at that Best western."
POSITIVE,"Free internet, free breakfast, free gym, free pool, very convenient."
POSITIVE,"Hotel Gregory is showing its age, but it's nice enough for our needs and the price is acceptable."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here Dec 26 - 31st. Check in was quick and efficient,. While the room we received was a clean and a 2 queen bedroom as we requested I went down to front desk to ask if a room with balcony was available, the woman at the front desk was very accommodating and changed our room immediately with no problem. The room was larger, which worked better for us since we were a party of three adults staying for a week. Pool was great first night - but problem with the heater on the third night was worked on immediately, though it wasn't a permanent fix. We talked to the front desk on Friday night and he sent out a maintenance person who worked for a good 15 minutes until he got it running. We were impressed that it was worked on right away. Housekeeping kept room clean daily, fridge was good temperature. Air conditioner didn't cool things as much as we wanted, but it could have been us Seattleites not used to the warm temperatures in December! The beds were so comfortable as were the pillows - I meant to ask what type of mattress they were before we left. Big Belly Deli and Cappy's were great restaurants within easy walking distance. The beach, with many surfers, is across the street just beyond the front yards of beautiful homes. We rented car from Enterprise, they pick you up and drop you back off at your hotel. The bus was easy transportation to Huntington Beach."
POSITIVE,The best Best Western I have ever stayed in. Breakfast was a ittle repetious but decent. Balance of facility was very good. Convenient location.
NEGATIVE,"I suppose this hotel gets lots of guests who are in Madison for UW hospital or for a convention or football game. I am from Madison and my husband and I have stayed at many hotels as we return almost every year for our anniversary. This hotel by far the worst we have stayed at. The only reason it is a 3 star hotel in my opinion is that they have a restaurant. We didn't eat anything at the hotel so I can't comment on that. Service was rude...we waited nearly 15 minutes to check in. Mind you, there were THREE people at the front desk and only one party ahead of us. Our room was mediocre at best. The beds are flimsy, the tub drain was clogged. It also smelled like an ashtray. Apparently they keep the nicer rooms for the Highland club...if you buy a standard room, it will NOT be one of those. Those are the rooms with pillowtop matresses and updated bathrooms. Interesting as those are standard in all rooms in the other 3 and 3.5 star hotels we have stayed at! This is one of the oldest and most poorly maintained 3 star properties I have stayed at in the area and I have no idea why the rates are so high and why it has gotten such good reviews."
POSITIVE,Had a wonderful and relaxing time in New Orleans and the Best Western was great. The Continental breakfast was the best. Thank you for a good and relaxing time with you and your staff.
POSITIVE,"The Landmark Best Western French Quarter is a lovely, updated hotel, but several blocks away from the main attractions of the French Quarter. My room exceeded my expectations, as New Orleans in the neighborhood seemed a bit rundown. Most importantly, my room was clean and quiet, so I didn't mind walking a bit. The common area (breakfast) seemed a bitÂ crowded and chaotic, but I was there at a busy time. The Front Desk was helpful and friendly."
POSITIVE,"Being right next to I-95 even on the ""quiet"" side we could hear (and feel) the traffic, but actually, ther is nothing anyone could do about that. Everything else was very good - clean, friendly, easy...'thought the square eggs at breakfast was a little weird, but maybe that's just me..."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here to be close to VIR on our third trip to Danville. Pleasantly surprised with the hotel. It seemed brand new - very clean and nicely appointed. The staff were very friendly and remembered us throughout our stay. We had one of the larger rooms with a sitting area. I would ask the hotel to consider placing some type of room divider between the seating and bedroom areas - the room was plenty large, but even though there were 2 TVs, you couldn't have 2 people watch then on different channels because they were so close together with no divider. The room would also be large enough for a small table and chairs to be placed in the room. Very nice, full breakfast (really - great variety including bacon and eggs and healthy choices like fruit, yogurt and cereal bars). The pool was extremely clean and large enough to turn around in - a pleasant surprise for a hotel. The exercise area was small with 3 machines, but it had enough variety for my workout and also offered the option of a free pass to a local fitness center. The rooms were not extremely well insulated - it was a bit noisy but it could have been because our room was near the stairway. The helpful, friendly staff really help make this place, but the rate, amenities and condition of the hotel were excellent too. Overall, we will definitely come back here next time we head to VIR! Room Tip: The larger rooms are very nice. Try for something away from the stairs or elevator to assure quiet. The front of the hotel faces the roadway (route 58) but is far enough back that noise was not an issue."
POSITIVE,We stayed here because we had a late arrival into the airport. It was a good place to stay for just one night. It was clean and had a breakfast. It worked out for what we needed.
POSITIVE,We found this hotel to be very convienent for our stay before and after our cruise. Our only complaint was the air conditioning was very cold. We finally turned it off completely to be comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel when we arrived early. We would stay again.
POSITIVE,"This was our family's favorite hotel on our trip to Washington. It was decorated so nicely, very clean (cleanliness is very important to me), extremely friendly staff, a lovely location, etc. If you're in the area, this is an excellent place to stay. You won't be disappointed!"
NEUTRAL,"We arrived late in the evening and found all in order, with the exception that there were absolutely no amenities; no kleenex, no shampoo, conditioner or badly-needed hand cream, one soap at outer basin (but none for shower), no glasses or ice bucket, and no wash cloths! Comfortable bed and good night's sleep --- but no amenities, which we found sorely-lacking. Definitely atypical of the many wonderful Best Western hotels we normally stay in."
POSITIVE,Great staff and wonderful room! Sat in the lobby by the fire in the morning while the rest of my family slept in. Very peaceful. Pros: Nice lodgey feel. Location: Look forward to visiting in the summer. Great location...close to Glenwwod Hot Springs and the Fairy Caverns.
POSITIVE,"Great rooms, about what you would expect from a good chain hotel, good value for money with breakfast included. I liked that the rooms were adjacent to an inside hallway rather than face directly outside, in the cold weather that feature was quite insulating so I didn't need to use my room heater at all despite the freezing outside temperatures. Helpful staff, especially in the Aspen Lounge. I would stay here again when I am in Los Alamos."
POSITIVE,We spent one night before the cruise to Mexico. The hotel was very nice. The staffs were helpful. We enjoyed the walk to the marina and waterfront stores. They have a shuttle that takes you anywhere within 5 miles. They took us to our cruise ship at Long Beach. I would stay at this hotel again. Nice hotel.
POSITIVE,"Opened the door and it smelled clean. Clorox wipes proved it was clean. One of the cleanest hotel rooms we have stayed in. The bathrooms are a bit small but the sink is outside the bathroom, a definite plus. Best of all there is a restaurant, Captain's Quarters, next door that served an outstanding salmon, shrimp, and scallops combo, and bacon wrapped shrimp on creamy grits with sausage and cheese. We had to get the manager to compliment the waitress, and the chef. The lady who cleaned tables actually CLEANED the tables thoroughly. It was a pleasure to see staff really doing a wonderful job. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here in December, 2011 on a trip from CT to FL. After a long, horrible day of driving on I-95, we stayed this motor lodge and were very happy with the accomodations. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was very comfortable, allowing us to get the rest we needed to complete our trip. The staff at this BW were friendly and helpful. Also, the complimentary breakfast was good with a nice selection of hot and cold breakfast foods. Better than most that we have experienced. This is a great place to stay during your travels along I-95 in the southeastern US. I would stay here again and recommend it to others."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is located on Grandville in the heart of downtownVancouver . Its location couldn't be better for what i paid for the room. I originally booked a courtyard room (means.... i have to walk up 3 flights of stairs, and room didn't have a microwave or a frdige) but i saved $35! Once i arrived they immediatly upgraded my to a standard room for no extra charge. Rooms are very clean plus they have a balcony. Excellent for dest staff. I""d definetely stay there again. Room Tip: book a courtyard room and they usually upgrade u to a standard room"
POSITIVE,"we stayed at this hotel for 2-3 days and it was really nice and comfortable stay. Although property was a bit old, room was very clean, big and had everything needed. The staff was friendly and helpful too. If i ever go to Vernon again, i would definitely stay there. Thumbs up!!!!!"
POSITIVE,"After being evacuated out of my first hotel because of hurricane Irene and checkin right out of another because of bugs, i was so grateful for bestwestern. The rooms were spotless and i had a great sleep. Then to awake to breakfast down in the lobby. Where the food was great. Then off to the pool/fitness area where it too excelled in excellence. Then as checking out printing off tickets the zoo in th business area. It trully was a great hotel, even if i did use then alot while writing this. GREAT HOTEL!! <3 It and their service!"
POSITIVE,This Hotel is situated by the ocean. Note not all rooms have a good view and none have a real balcony. Its view or partial view only. The hotel is clean and has good linnen and bed. It was a one nite stopover on the way home and it is 9 miles to SFO an easy drive and a way betetr stay than near the airport whre there is no view. Room has flat screen T-V and a small frige. The hotel had continental breakfast and it was good. Would stay again.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is really good and the rooms were clean. Being a gold Member with Best western rewards, I was offered a free upgrade to a suite and the room was really nice with the Microwave and refrigerator in it. It was really convenient location being very close to the Time Square. Overall and really nice Best Western plus hotel and affordable and good place to stay. The breakfast offered was really good and the staff was fantastic. I will definitely stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"Seriously, what the hell is wrong with this hotel! Totally not value for money. Damn small room, noisy air con, small bed, small and dirty toilet, felt like I was cheated of my money! Location is so-so. I certainly stayed in better ones at the same rate. Try room mate grace instead. Honestly, I felt more like a prisoner rather than a guest. It's that bad. And the worst thing is the housekeeping people leave their working station/trolley just outside the lift lobby of every level. Totally regret to the max!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel like we have done many times before. The room was small but when I'm in New york City, I don't plan on spending too much time in the hotel room. Nothing to complain about as others did, the hotel staff were very nice to us."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel very well located near Times Square. With modern common areas, great decor and refurbished rooms. However, not all rooms were fully refurbished and redecorated. First I was put in a small room, which at first sight had been restored, thanks to the new wallpaper and modern decor. However, the bathroom was not redecorated, seriously in need of work. The sink taps sometimes just lay cold water, while other times the water only came out hot. Everything was old. Poor air conditioning, too old, whose temperature I could not regulate and the noise was unbearable. A few days after arriving (and with very negative temperatures on the street and as air conditioning that didn't work properly) I tried to turn it off (despite the cold) but the situation only worsened. The noise grew louder and I had to ask to fix that. Although initially seem that the situation was resolved, the air conditioner started to make noise again and pour a lot of steam water (like a sauna). During the night, when I finally had fallen asleep, I began to feel a few drops of water falling on my body. The air conditioning released so much steam water that allowed water to accumulate on the roof, causing rain in bed. Faced with this situation, I went to reception and demanded immediate change of room. The new room had an air conditioner that worked properly and the room was more spacious. What made ââme realize that I had initially been assigned a lower bedroom category than the one that I've paid (Deluxe queen room). That's why I was surprised by the small dimensions of the room ... Because of this confusion, I can not recommend the hotel. When returning to New York, surely I will choose another hotel. And another area of the city. After two times in New York, both times in Times Square, there are other quieter, beautiful areas, and equally well located, where to stay."
NEUTRAL,"We arrived here via Priceline for the Veteran's Day weekend. We asked for an upgrade and rec'd one, but not complimentary as noted by the other review. The upgraded room was okay. King bed, pull out couch, jacuzzi tub...Our friends had another room and it was small, but we are quite used to that in NYC. After all, you aren't there to sit in your rooms, you are there to sleep (very little) and shower. This hotel is a great location to Time Square/Broadway. My only real complaint is the cleanliness of the room. It needed a good scrub down and dusting. The shower needed some clorox clean up and the room needed some murphy's oil soap! Not dirty, per say, you could just tell it needed a good scrub down. On the plus side, the bed and pull out couch were comfortable. Another plus, most of the staff were very nice. I would stay here again. However, it won't be my first choice. I won't use Priceline again for NYC. The last time we did, we got the Millinneum Hotel/Broadway and it was very nice. I just don't like taking chances. I really like the Comfort Inn Theatre District - 44th street."
POSITIVE,The location to the airport and the city. We were on the 5th floor - right across from the elevator. It was very noisy due to traffic on Harbour Drive as well as the ice machine and pop machine cooler. Had a much quieter room 2 wks before.
POSITIVE,From the minute you walk in to the minute you live you feel at home and there is nothing more you can ask for out of a hotel.
POSITIVE,"The rooms are large and clean. Newly remodeled bathrooms. Great breakfast. Friendly staff. Everything was great, then you layed on the bed!!! It was hard as a rock.... Woke up soooo stiff then ate a great breakfast. Give and take?"
POSITIVE,"Hotel needs updated, while we were there we saw many new mattresses being delivered. The one bedroom suite was huge, but the sleep sofa was in terrible condition, luckily we didn't need to use it.I think they are working on some updates. The location was perfect for us,close to the beach, shopping,restaurants and movies."
POSITIVE,This hotel was easy to get to. Great value ...close enough to the beach. Would recommend.
NEGATIVE,Clean large room overlooking the pool. Would stay there anytime. Can't beat the price.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was convienent to stores and restaurants. Our room was large and clean. However,the pillows were horrible. If we stay there again,we will bring our own pillows."
POSITIVE,"We had to have our house fumigated for termites and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. I originally thought I needed to try to check in before the 4pm check in time and they said they would call around 9pm the night before to see how it was going. They did call around 9:15 and said someone checked into the room they had for us but we could use one in the front of the hotel if we wanted but it was closer to the street and not as quiet. We opted to keep original reservation. When we checked in we have a very nice 2 queen bed room on the 3rd floor on the back side so it was very quiet. They have an elevator and stairs so that was nice. Room was very nice and clean and had a microwave and refrigerator. The hot tub was not working and they said it would be fixed the next day and would call me when it was done. They took my room number and called around 4 to let me know it was fixed and to give it about an hour or so to heat up. Everyone was very friendly. When I came back to my room after it was cleaned it smelled very nice so that was good. The beds were pretty comfy and lots of pillows. The free breakfast wasn't anything to write home about but most of them aren't. They had egg patties, sausage, hashbrown patties, bread, bagles, little muffins and cereal and of course orange juice, apple juice and coffee. I would stay there again with no problem. Room Tip: Ask for a room on the back side as it's very quiet except for people going in and out of the roo..."
POSITIVE,"After hours of traveling, all you want to do is check into a nice hotel and get into a comfortable bed. The Best Western at Potomac Mills was definitely that haven for me. It was comfortable, inviting and clean. The staff was friendly and informative. The breakfast buffet was fresh with plenty of choices. The location was perfect with a great deal of [?] restaurants around and shopping within walking or driving distance. I would highly recommend the Best Western at Potomac Mills if you're traveling in the Woodbridge area."
POSITIVE,Staff were very friendly. Check in was quick. Very relaxing atmosphere. Great on-site restaurant.
POSITIVE,"When heading to Bradford, PA. the Best Western Plus Bradford Inn should be at the top of your list for hotel accommodations.The Best Western is a well established hotel in the Bradford area (meaning not brand new) but is well maintained. They were actually doing renovations to the lobby area during our stay.The room was well equipped with a nice flat screen TV and a Micro-Fridge unit and everything was clean and working.The teenagers in our travel party also enjoyed the pool.I will stay there again upon my return to Bradford."
POSITIVE,The girl at the desk was so young..but after speaking with her i realized she was so mature and so incredibly nice. Southern hospitality at its best. The room was convienient and breakgast was phenominal.
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, beautiful modern rooms and great ammenities. But the best part was the Bed -the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on (and I have a sleep number bed at home)! I travel alot for business and I will be sure to stay in this hotel every time I'm in Southern Utah. Great night's sleep - great value!"
POSITIVE,Clean inn but old - needs updating in the rooms and hallways. Very friendly staff. Room is a bit small for 3 adults and 2 kids (and a dog) ... had trouble fitting rollaway bed in room. Nice access to center courtyard. Very nice breakfast and lots of room for seating. Indoor pool is very nice. Great value!
POSITIVE,"It's cheap compared to the hotels around it. It's also pretty clean and the rooms are nice. The service was so-so, but I usually don't care about service. One problem encountered was that the maximum temperature of the water wasn't very hot and that kinda bummed me out because I wanted to take a relaxing bath."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel many times in the past. I visited solo recently and it was my first visit in 3 or 4 years. The staff was super helpful, as always. The lobby was clean and neat. Making reservations was a breeze. Did not use the pool, but looked at it, and it was very clean. Went to my room upstairs. It was very clean, and the housekeeper did an excellent job. Free WiFi was wonderful. The furnishings are showing a little bit of wear, but that is to be expected. I like how they have the blanket in between two flat sheets, so they can wash the sheets each time. Very sanitary--great idea. The only thing I would complain about, has nothing to do with the hotel service. There were some workers outside in the parking lot early in the morning, who had apparently stayed the night there. They were outside at 6:30 laughing and talking loud. This hotel has sealed windows and even with the air on I could hear them and they woke me up. Very rude behavior, as not all of us need to be up by 6:30. The breakfast was wonderful, the area was kept very clean. Cereal, Jimmy Dean biscuits, and waffles were available, along with bagels, juice, and more. I love this hotel and would recommend to a friend. Room Tip: Ask for the third floor--top floor and seems the quietest."
POSITIVE,"Nice pool and jacuzzi; good size room with mini fridge and microwave; fantastic breakfast; soup available in the evening to ""greet"" you when you get back after a long day ""waterfall hunting""; what else can I say? This was probably our favorite motel stay---would come back in a heartbeat!"
POSITIVE,close to coal valley.....where we were going. nice breakfast. desk person VERY helphful. we needed instructions on how to get to where we were going and she was V E R Y helpful...
POSITIVE,"No surprises: an old -historic?- building rehabbed into a dining room/meeting space w/ a modern hotel wing attached. A few minor quibbles (footboard sticks out too far into the room, bathroom ventilation is poor) but overall a good experience. Location is a few blocks less ""downtowny"" than I was (for some reason) expecting, but still very walkable; and proximity to I-37 and St Paul Square/old SouPac station is excellent."
POSITIVE,"I was in town for a conference at the Marriotts and stayed at this hotel. The room was wonderful; clean, large, comfortable and within easy walking distance of the Rivercenter at a fraction of the cost. The staff were very helpful and the free breakfast was a bonus. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it without reservation."
POSITIVE,"There are few selections and few differences, but the staff here make this hotel stand out. Very friendly and will go out of their way to make sure that not just your hotel experience is great, but your whole time in Whitehorse is!"
POSITIVE,Very clean place to stay on our move to Georgia. Oustanding on allowing our pooches to stay!!! Highly recommend for any stay!!!
POSITIVE,"The location and price. We had to move from our assigned room because water from a leak was seeping into the room and soaking the carpet. The management did move us into another equal room. No refund was given for the inconvenience, however."
NEUTRAL,"The room is clean. Complimentary hot breakfast is nice. Wireless internet works well. But we can smell smoke, coming from the hallway in a non-smoking room. A guy was knocking our room door like 3:00 AM for no reasons."
POSITIVE,We have stay a few times and have always enjoyed our stay.Pros: Clean and the staff is so nice.
POSITIVE,"this hotel surprised us in every way. we were looking for something cheap for a short (12 hour) stay during a 2 day road trip. the price was very reasonable, so i didnt expect to get much for it. we were surprised to see such a nice room, impeccably clean, with all sorts of amenities, including a fridge! the best part was the pool, which was huge and [?] clean, and the whirlpool was nice and hot! we have paid more for a day pass to a local pool for the day than we paid for that stay. oh yeah, breakfast was included!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at 4 hotels on our vacation. This was the best of the bunch. Big clean room. sitting area with couch, desk chair. Fridge, coffee maker. One of the better ""included"" breakfasts we've had - even an Omelet station. Very convenient to Mt St Helens & to Seattle. Friendly staff."
NEGATIVE,The first room had the remnents of the privious occupents on the rug and in the tissue box. The second room provided had dried bloody mucus on the shower curtain. Will never stay there again.
POSITIVE,This hotel was clean and comfortable. The only major complaint that I have was that there was no ice machine on the second floor
NEGATIVE,"We stayed here Labor day weekend. By Sunday I noticed that my wrists and hands were itching a lot and asked my spouse if he was having any problems. By the time we got home I was itching a lot, arms, neck, torso, etc. I did not even suspect that the hotel had bugs until I happened to go on the National Bed Bug Registry and another person got bed bugs from this same hotel in May 2011. DO NOT stay here. I feel crawly and now will spend a ton of money on extermination because this filthy hotel rents bug infested rooms."
POSITIVE,"This is one of the nicest Best Westerns I have stayed in. Has more the feeling of an independent small hotel than a chain. Rooms look new and modern. Has a nice outdoor seating area for having a drink. Bear in mind that it's a bit of a drive into the center of Cleveland, if that's where your business is."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel for a kids chess tournament nearby. This hotel is conveniently located next to two freeways and yet it's relatively quiet from the freeway noise one would usually expect. Compared to most other Best Western hotels, this one seems one level higher with its own restaurant and conference rooms. The hotel also has a gym and an outdoor pool. We are a couple with a 10-year old child and stayed in a room with two queen size beds. The room has almost everything we needed: TV, small refrigerator, microwave oven, iron & board, hair dryer, coffer maker... The only drawback is there was only one chair. The best part is the hotel offers good complimentary hot breakfast excluding meat which costs extra. The hotel also has a Chinese buffet restaurant next door (but not very good food though), a McDonald's restaurant next door, a Subway restaurant and a CVS pharmacy across the street. The hotel is located in a safe area with some office buildings in the neighborhood. It's easy to find and easy to get on and off the freeway. Room Tip: There are two types of rooms. One with a kind size bed and the other with two queen size beds. If you have a small kid to share the same room, you may want to make sure you book a room with two queen beds. See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,My husband and I were in our room asleep when someone walked into our room saying it was there's. Our room was over booked!!!!! The manger was unhelpful and said that if we wanted to check out then we could but that's the only way we could get our money back. My husband is an iraq war veteran and almost attacked the person walking into our room but realized he was safe when I told him where we were. I will never stay here again! Our room key worked to all the doors down the 2nd floor hallway.
POSITIVE,"This hotel is an old building, visibly worn but clean and maintained. Slight musty smell in the halls. Very little noise from the airport, our room faced it and I only heard one airplane take off - again, very faint noise there. Restaurant had decent food at a reasonable price for breakfast. If you don't want to stay in a casino, this place works well."
POSITIVE,"The staff The view I feel its a good choice being about equal distance from downtown n.o. and the airport. From the time I first walked through the door, every staff member I encountered was very friendly,courtious,and helpful. The room was very nice and even had a fridge&micro. Very large h.d. tv,very comfy beds and even though it was right by the freeway,I never heard any traffic noise. A nice feature was access to upper floor parking right out of my room. I had a great 4 day stay and would no hesitate to stay again. Easy freeway access and plenty of food and shopping close by."
POSITIVE,"Older but remodeled motel. Very good rate, nice service and well-appointed room. Very clean, good bed frig and comfortable furnishings."
POSITIVE,Cleanliness and friendly staff.
NEUTRAL,difficult to adjust room temperature due to central heating and air conditioning.
POSITIVE,"This is a great place. I've had the pleasure of spending time at this establishment all four seasons. The place is great, but the area and grounds are even better and a little different each time. I love seeing a picture of the same location during all four seasons, and this place is no different. Supper accomidations, clean, and priced right. ""Mountain Air"" makes you feel alive and great any time of the year. I'll be back! Room Tip: Rooms or cabins. There's no wrong place. I perfer the country view of the back rooms and I'v..."
POSITIVE,"The rooms are clean and you get like 7 pillows (King bed). Small things like shampoo and soap were missing. I think that you can request a microwave and mini fridge, but rooms don't have it otherwise. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast is good: eggs, bacon/ sausage, pancakes, cereal, oranges, bananas, apples, coffee, tea, bagels, muffins. Didn't use the pool or the complimentary bike rentals because it was Winter time. The heated tub is in a separate building, but didn't go either. I did use the gym passes (Colorado Athletic Center...very nice) that can be either free or have a discount depending on your room rate. In my case they were $7, instead of the regular $15 one-day- pass rate. Location is South Boulder, like 2 minutes away from the highway (US-36). Right next to the hotel you can find: Outlook Hotel, Housing Helpers, Vic's, gas station, church, senior apartment complexes."
NEGATIVE,"They gave us a room without a bath. When we asked for a room with a bath they gave us the excuse that ""price line"" customers get either a smoking or handicap room. Priceline had nothing to do with it. I got a suite in Chicago for the same price as this handicap room in Fredericksburg Tx. It also smelled of FeBreeze to cover up the fact that 100% of their rooms are pet friendly...just not people friendly.... I will never stay here again. Room Tip: Pet Friendly but not People Freindly"
NEGATIVE,"The hotel carpeting and appointments looked as if no one had upgraded the space in a long time. It was a flight and a half of stairs to get to our second-floor room, and there was no elevator. The scrambled eggs for breakfast were as dry as sawdust but the coffee was good. We returned to Kanab a few days later and stayed in a much nicer place."
NEUTRAL,"Cannot beat this location. Arrived on a 1am flight. The hotel clerk was courteous. Breakfast was so so. Could be helpful if you bring soap, they provide one tiny bar."
NEUTRAL,Convenient to Interstate and surrounding area. Noisy location. Clean room. Friendly staff. Good restaurant (Beef O'Brady's) in motel.
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here for 2 weeks on business - working at the airport. Rooms are clean and comfy, though the breakfast is a bit on the light side. Extremely small gym, so hope it isn't busy if you feel the need for a workout, although the swimming pool is decent enough. Internet wireless connectivity was a bit ropey, with constant resets being required to connect."
POSITIVE,"Clean, inexpensive, stunning new decor, what more can I say? Excellent location if driving from FL to NC about half way, highly recommend this hotel."
NEUTRAL,This Best Western is close to the airport so you will hear the jet engines of the planes. This I expected but what I did not expect were the noises from the trains nearby. Transportation was provided to and from the Ontario Airport. Clean rooms. Overall a nice hotel stay.
POSITIVE,Great place to stay. Great breakfast. Slept well. Friendly people. Pros: breakfast Cons: liked everything. Location: convenient.
POSITIVE,The only downside to our stay was the partying that went on in other rooms on our floor for two nights lasting until 2:30. It was Spring Break. Security did come to break one party up. I loved the location and the staff was awesome!
POSITIVE,"I'll tell ya, for the money you can not beat this hotel. The room was well appointed, clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable. I normally stay at one of the Hilton family of hotels and I actually enjoyed this hotel more. I particularly enjoyed the in room coffee, it was very tastey. If you can live without the fancy lobby and long hallways this is [?] the place for you."

POSITIVE,"The room was spacious, clean. Was perfect for studying - very quite area. Perfect location - close to evrything in Columbia. Also the service was fantastic :) Im staying there next week again."
NEGATIVE,"We were supposed to stay for 6 nights on a business trip but we left after one night. It was too late to cancel the reservation when we arrived in the evening. The location was good (we thought) right across the street from Upper Canada Mall. There is an independant restaurant attached to the hotel (didn't try it). We pulled up and could smell weed right away, heard very strange yelling going on from the second floor of the outdoor access rooms. There were very sketchy looking people in the lobby when we were trying to check in. The carpet was worn and the room smelled stale. The fan and AC were very loud and when it kicked it it made a god awful noise. The in room fridge was room temperature (disappointing since we had something to refridgerate). The staff were great about letting us check out next morning without problem, but I wouldn't stay there agian. We moved to another hotel in Markham we had stayed at before, even though it was further away."
POSITIVE,"This was my first trip to Boston and did not know the location at all. I was impressed with the staff, everybody was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and happy to answer all the questions. The rooms are nice and comfortable, small improvements needed here and there. Excellent housekeeping, good food, fresh coffee throughout the day at a reasonable price. What more can you ask for? Front desk girls went all the way and beyond with directions and useful tips when visiting downtown Boston. Great management! Keep up the good work!"
POSITIVE,The beds here are very comfortable and the rooms are very quiet. The only shortcoming was the lack of a microwave.
POSITIVE,"Had a great one night stay at this hotel. Even though we didn't check in until 7pm we took advantage of the pool and had an evening swim, towels were already outside by the pool which was convenient. the restaurant on the other side of the parking lot offers a 20% discount to guests. which we also took advantage of and had a late night snack..food wasÂ ok. parking was easy and the hotel is right off the fwy which is great, there's a walmart about a mile away too! anyway i wish we could've stayed longer. the staff was really friendly and accommodating. i would definitely go back and recommend it to friends =)"
POSITIVE,"Great staff! Rarely have I ever known the names of hotel staff but everyone was so friendly that it was easy to remember them! Excellent job Kimberly, Chris, Jose & Charlene! Rooms were clean, nice sized flat panel TVs (especially in the breakfast area). Nice front lobby. Used the business center and worked great! Mall and several restaurants are nearby. Everything was clean and well taken care of. First night there was a small bag with water and a couple small snacks on the desk. What a nice touch! Did I mention they have a pillow MENU!?! You can choose from a variety of pillows. Some are in the room, a three other choices are available at front desk. Used the feather pillow and loved it! They provided a special shuttle service that was amazing and was very helpful to get around!! Arranged a taxi for me to get to DFW and it was one of the best taxi experiences I have had...very fast & friendly! Good work everyone...it shows!"
POSITIVE,"My family stayed here for only one night on a UP color tour. We found it was both a classier hotel and a cheaper one than most in the Mackinac City area. We had to cross the mighty Mackinac Bridge for $3.50 to get there but that was our intention anyway. It was within walking distance to the downtown area that had the usual touristy stores, fudge shops, both high and low end eateries, museums and ferries to Mackinac Island. The Best Western compound is quite large, with at least 4 separate buildings, with most rooms having a full or partial view of the lake. Check-in was a breeze, the room was clean and the balcony was a nice touch. The breakfast bar had the usual bagels, muffins, cereal, scrambled and boiled eggs and sausage, juices and coffee and tea, but it was well-stocked and the eating area was spacious. The indoor pool was in great condition and it opened early and stayed open late since it was in the front office complex. Two disappointments were an amazingly too-soft bed and a shower curtain that didn't quite reach down into the tub so water got all over the bathroom floor. I ordered our room online and got better prices with Expedia than any other hotel search."
POSITIVE,Over the years we've stayed at several motels and B&B in St. Ignace. The BEST WESTERN Harbour Pointe Lakefront motel is by far the best experience. The staff is very pleasant and willing to go the extra mile to make sure your stay is a pleasant one. The rooms are clean and we've noticed updating such as flat screen TVs and new air cooling and heating units installed recently. We will return..! Room Tip: Stay in the building nearest to the water to get all the lake has to offer (view). See more room tips
POSITIVE,"This is a nice property, convenient to the freeway. Amenities are good--business center, etc. Clean. Very quiet. Room could use update--e.g., flat screen tv standard these days at this hotel's price point. Room service did not come the one morning of my three day stay during which I did not leave the room early."
POSITIVE,"Although we had low expectations due to a previous stay 10 years ago, we were pleasantly surprised to find newly carpeted and decorated rooms and hallways. Beds were comfortable, pillows fluffy, room immaculate. Our hotel choice was dictated by its proximity to a family gathering just blocks away. If there were New Year's celebrations we heard nothing thanks to the great controls on the room air conditioning fan. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Self made waffles, varieties of fresh fruit, hard cooked eggs, bagels, donuts in addition to varieties of dry cereals and instant oatmeal were hardly a dining experience, but the area looked out at a garden/pool, counters and tables were clean. Room price was probably slightly inflated due to New Year's eve. A previous reviewer described the area well. We also noted that the security guard was a welcome sight. Except for the ballpark and LitchfieldPark airport, the area has little to offer. Room Tip: Interior hallway access rooms on the second floor are the best."
POSITIVE,"The Hacienda is like a Mexican Resort you would find in a super upscale part of Mexico... We rented 2 rooms for my son's graduation from boot camp at MCRD... Checked into the Hacienda and was greeted with a beautiful lobby. Ice water with oranges and a super friends hostess Natalie. Anything we asked for they jumped to help. The rooms were clean, pool clean, everything including old town was right within walking distance and more. Great for kids and families... We had a part of 10 and did fine... The hardest workers were the shuttle guys Brandon & Brendon... they were awesome and helped out more than you could ever ask for A+... The cost per night was reasonable and parking was easy and fair... Only the night woman Barbara was needing a little adjustment (being a little nicer)... But over all this place rocks for location and service. We'll be back for future visits..."
POSITIVE,"Very confortable beds. The lady at the reception was very helpful in resolving a booking issue (that was caused by the hotel). Good value for the money paid to Hotels.com. However it seems below the level of other Best Western Hotels and needs some renovation. The price on the Best Western site is too high, if you use it for your booking you could be [?] disappointed."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I will use the park n fly option, again. Great deal. Attractive room and features (pool & spa). Lobby was decorated for the holidays, and a cozy place to wait for any reason. Note: the charming room included a chilly but attractive bathroom. Neighborhood isn't a destination in itself, but the hotel feels safe. Enjoy a great night's sleep [?] before you fly!"
NEUTRAL,"The shuttle from the airport was prompt. When we arrived and attempted to check in we were told they coundn't find our reservation. After a long time, they finally said someone else had checked in under our name. They did find us a room but no other explanation was given. The rooms are dated but decent. Our sink was filthy and hadn't been cleaned but [?] the remainder of the room was adequate. There is a train that passes frequently right next to the hotel. Bring ear plugs! Breakfast was muffins, bagels etc. We spent one night on our way to Napa. This place was nothing special but got the job done."
NEGATIVE,First of all I went there because of a 4 start rating. We showed up at 230 and were told check in was at 3pm. So we waited with two toddlers and then checked in at 3pm but was told there were no clean rooms and had to wait until 330. One person at the counter. I originally asked for 2 queen beds but was told there was none and had to use a couch(inside [?] bed) and queen bed. In our room there were no wash clothes or towels in the bathroom. No garbage bags in the room either.
POSITIVE,"Close to all of downtown events & restaurants, walking distance to the train. Easy check in, room was ready,cool and clean."
POSITIVE,"We stay at this hotel when we visit my brother-in-law and it is really nice with the best free breakfast. My only complaint would be that the hotel staff need to brush up on some of their customer relations. The rule is you shouldn't answer the phone if there is a customer standing in front of you. And if you do you should place that person on hold to help the person in front of you. This has happened to me with multiple employees. It would be nice if they would say something like: I apologize, I'll be with you in just one moment-instead they just stare right through you like you are invisible. To their credit, once it is ""my turn"" they are polite and attentive. This is not enough to not make me stay there just annoy me slightly."
POSITIVE,"The beds were soft, pillows fluffy, the AC worked just great!! I will stay here anytime I go to Biloxi....Very affordable, and the staff was very friendly. The pool was nice and the breakfast was great!"
POSITIVE,"Overall it was a good experience, especially that they were able to return via Fedex the iphone I left in my room and included in the room rate was a good breakfast."
NEGATIVE,"On the night we arrived the front desk attendant was not friendly. He seemed to be more concerned with telling us all the rules that we must follow at the hotel and the resulting consequences for non-compliance. The room was clean enough, however the door knob didn't work well and the security locks did not provide a feeling of security. There were loud disturbances during the night from other guests I suspect. The first night there seemed to be several police cars visiting the property."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here with a volleyball team for a weekend tournament. Great staff, comfortable, spacious room. Loved it being a non-smoking hotel. Kids loved the pool. Breakfast was great. This was the second time we have come here. Great rates for teams. Room Tip: rooms on main floor are larger"
POSITIVE,"This was a one night stop, passing through Kamloops. The room was spacious and clean, the bed comfortable and, although we had little contact with the staff, they were obliging. The breakfast was a little weak - rather unappetizing hot options, no yogurt, all on styrofoam and plastic. That said, I would return as the property is new, in good repair and well run."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions. Both times we felt it was a very good value. The rooms are spacious and clean. The full breakfast is also tasty! The hotel is at the intersection of three busy roads, so we recommend that you try to get a room on the side away from I270. We will not hesitate to stay here whenever we need a room in this location."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel is close to Ohio Wesleyan University which is why it was chosen. The hotel is clean and the staff is nice. The problem is that the hotel allows smoking. To get to a non smoking room you have to go to the second floor with no elevator. Also, even though it is non-smoking once smoke is around a hotel it is hard to avoid the smell. Also, the printers in the lobby are for use to print boarding passes. Good perk but you have to pay for the paper for the printer-not a huge deal but inconvenient especially since there was not a clerk to be found to give me the paper when I needed to print. Also, no high speed internet in the rooms. The breakfast was nice the normal fare but the waffles were a good addition to the standard cereal. Not many choices in the area but it was affordable (used my AAA discount) and clean which is the main thing."
NEUTRAL,Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work. Room Tip: Book your room way in advance if you plan to get what you want on a weekend.
NEGATIVE,"We stayed at this hotel for one night in September during our tour of CA, the receptionist, a young girl, was very rude on arrival, worst person we came across during our 3 week holiday! The rooms were ok, breakfast ok. The only thing that was good was the guy on reception on our check out. Would not stay there again, bad service!"
NEGATIVE,"The room was cold, the heater was not working, toilet was not flushing, I tried to cxl my room had a hard time still not cxled. We left and went to Ottawa. Brrokstreet resort hotel was Beautiful."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was a very brief drive away from the SeaTac Airport. The staff were very helpful when we had questions, the free breakfast was wonderful and the restaurant food at night was really good. Drinks at the bar were only $4 each (if you like Merlot, this is a good glass of wine to get here). There were free apples at the front counter and the rooms were very nicely decorated and comfortable. You cannot go wrong with this hotel, which is very reasonably priced as part of an Expedia package. It is a nice, quiet family hotel."
POSITIVE,"I received great service from the staff. Thank you,"
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, awesome free breakfast, clean room. If traffic noise keeps you awake, just request a room away from PCH. They are very accommodating. I will definitely visit again!"
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed the room with the jacuzzi and especially the balcony. It said partial ocean view but we could see the water and the beach nicely. The room was spacious and comfortable. We loved the closeness to the beach, but there were not many restaurants or shops close by. There were mainly galleries for several blocks. We'd definitely stay here agai [?] n!"
POSITIVE,"Stayed here as part of a package. The location was in the downtown area, near restaurants on India avenue. Staff were nice, parking onsite for ten dollars, continental breakfast included. The rooms were nice with a small balcony. Beds comfortable and very clean. This property was really nice with everything a traveller needs. My only comment would be that there was no decor that made you feel like you were in San Diego, could have been an airport hotel in seattle. Would be nice to have some spanish influenced touches. We found a wonderful Saturday market within walking distance the next morning. Room Tip: ask for harbour side See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Central & close to railway breakfast area too small
NEUTRAL,"The lake was pretty Difficult to get to based on signs Based on the website, I was led to believe there was a lounge and bar onsite. It turned out it was across the street. I picked this hotel because I was going to a funeral with a group of family members that needed a meeting place to gather. This did not work out as the hotel was not conducive to this type of meeting. I definately would have picked another hotel."
POSITIVE,would definitely stay here again! breakfast was good. Pool was great. Beds were comfortable! great price too!
POSITIVE,"The beds were very comfortable. And the room was very clean. The pool was ice-cold and way too salty!! Excellent, within walking distance to the Mall of America, yet they still offered a shuttle. The beds were very comfortable. And the room was very clean. The free breakfast was also very good; many options available."
POSITIVE,"This was a very nice hotel but watch out for a couple of points. Firstly, don't be fooled by the pictures of the bedrooms on the website - the superior rooms are not any bigger than the standard rooms. We had a quick look at the room next door - a standard - and apart from having a walk in shower instead of a shower over the bath was exactly the same. When I enquired as to the difference I was told that superior rooms are the ones that have been refurbished but other comments on this website do not bear this out. Plus check that you are getting a balcony if you want one - ours didn't have one. I did also feel that for the price it would have been nice to replace the two small bottles of water which we drank very quickly on the first - what with the room being so hot. Bit silly to replace an empty bottle neatly back on the table! 2 radiators is possibly overdoing the heating a bit. We also had to request another chair - only one provided. The spa was lovely but take care - parts of the floor in the ladies changing room were very slippery. We decided to have a drink at the bar during Happy Hour but had to ask for our 25% discount so take care. The lovely bar assistant told us she wasn't authorised to give the discount but she did fetch someone who was. Might of been a good idea to put someone on during happy hour who was authorised. Plus may I suggest that Best Western invest in another toast maker - each piece of bread had to go through twice to become toast rather than warm bread. We had no problems with parking and the spaces are plenty big enough for a people carrier, so goodness knows what other people on thsi website were driving when they complained about spaces being too small. This hotel is not very near the beach so if you have small children wanting a beach holiday you will probably want to get nearer the front. Room Tip: If you want a Superior room check it has a balconey - otherwise don't bother, a standard should..."
POSITIVE,"On a recent trip to UK and Germany I stayed here for two nights, mainly to catch a particular show at the Pavilion. Ate in the hotel restaurant the first night and the food and service were so good that I was a little disappointed that I wouldn't have time to dine there again before going to the show the next night. Breakfast was very enjoyable both mornings with bright and cheery greetings from the attentive but not intrusive staff. The single room was small but this is in line with my expectations given the very good pricing of my stay and was very clean. The bed was very comfortable and I had no problems with noise from adjacent rooms."
POSITIVE,"This was a last minute trip with my elderly disabled mother, she wanted to see the sea and hear seagulls - both of which we were able to do, I am pleased to say. The hotel was well located on the West Cliff and within an easy strolling distance to the cliff top. We were welcomed to the hotel by excellent front desk staff and I was impressed with the quick way they managed my request for 2 rooms close together, which was not what had originally been allocated. The single room swe had on the first floor, were well appointed and the bathrooms appeared to be recently fitted out. Bar and restaurant staff were a pleasure to deal with. I would certainly stay here myself again and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to others. Room Tip: Single room number 20 on the first floor, has windows on 3 sides and is lovely and light."
NEGATIVE,"Booked this hotel and stayed 1 night Jan 2nd , 2 rooms on the basis of the trip advisor rating, we wish now that we hadn't, faulty towers springs to mind. A good breakfast but not any other positives. A catalogue of bad customer service errors. As follows. 1/arrived at hotel 12,30 pm after a long 200 miles drive asked politely if any chance we could check in early. Reply from receptionist No, all rooms just vacated so go away and come back at 2.30pm and i will see what i can do. (she didnt ask our names so didnt know which rooms were reserved for us ). 2/ went back at 2.30 checked in to 2 superior rooms on top floor. Asked if that when we check out the next day any chance of using the spa until around 4.0pm because our daughters were attanding a concert and would not be finished until that time, we did not want use of the room just the spa. Answer a kurt ""No you can only use the spa until 2.0pm of the day you check out."" I then suggested paying an extra day rate cost to cover this. (a day rate extra cost is standard in the hotel world of being available and is usually 50% of the room rate cost for staying until 6.0pm) The answer was ""NO we don't do a day rate if you want to stay in the spa it will be an extra full nights rate"". We kindly declined 3/ Had fabulous cocktails at 1812 cocktail bar which is 5 minutes walk away, followed by wonderful dinner at the Crabroom also 5 minutes walk away. Returned to hotel at 11.30 pm. There was a rather large disco party on, No problem as we also like to party sometimes. However we were on the third floor and the room vibrated to the thudding of the bass of the disco. (no mention of a noisy party when we booked or checked in) 4Then woken up further by a noisy party in the next room, had to bang on wall to get it to stop. 5/ woken up at 6.30am by the noisy shower in room next door ( we could even hear them moving the shower curtain, (we were in a refurbished room but obviously paper thin walls) 6/ Then to cap it all we were woken up at 8.30 am by banging and sawing which was from workmen renovating 3-4 rooms near us. NO ONE AT TIME OF BOOKING OR CHECKING IN TOLD US OF POTENTIAL NOISE FROM ROOM REFURBISHMENTS. 7/ Went and had a breakfast which after all the above was suprisingy good and so was the service in there. This hotel took our money and gave very poor service. If you want a hotel whereby you check in late and leave early and dont mind banging sawing and people in the next rooms hearing you then i suggest you book. If like us you are used to more then don't."
NEUTRAL,"A bit noisy because of the near boulevard traffic, and old heater"
POSITIVE,"My sister organised the booking of this Hotel for a family jolly for three nights. Arrived at the annex and thought we had arrived at a dingy bedsit when we realised we were booked in at the main Hotel, so pleasantly surprised. There was a total of 13 in our party, some staying in the annex and some in the main Hotel. I stayed in the main hotel and really liked the twin room, although double bed was a tad small, but the room was really clean and roomy. The additional bed set up for my son was really comfortable and not the usual sub standard 'put me up.' My sister and her family were in the annex and although the impression from the frontage is not good and is not of the same standard of the main hotel the room was well decorated, really roomy and was very clean. I would be more than happy to stay in the annex on future stays. The real assets of this hotel are the staff, who are exemplary and really do everything they can to accommodate you, even if you are an awkward party of 13 with different demands and expectations. On the first night eight of us decided to eat in the hotel restaurant while the remainder decided to eat at Harry Ramsden's. Those who stayed in the hotel got the better deal. The food was a real surprise and was of an excellent standard, the kitchen even catered for my niece who wanted Moules off menu. The cheese platter which included artisan British cheeses such as; Stinking Bishop and Black Stick, was one of the best I have had in a hotel restaurant and matches some of the best London restaurants where I have eaten. The breakfast was equally good with a great selection choices including an excellent full English breakfast; would have liked black pudding though . The biggest surprise is that this is rated a 3* hotel. Room Tip: If you are not overly worried about walking across a courtyard to the main hotel or having a large flat screen TV, annex rooms are worth a look, as they are a fraction of the price of an overnight stay. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This motel is directly on Flathead Lake in Polson, Montana. There are boat docks in front and a large boat that the motel uses for tours of the lake throughout the day. Our room was on the first floor, with about 20 feet of grass between our patio and the lake. The patios have chairs and a table to use at each room where we sat in the evening and watched a beautiful rain storm and sunset! The beds were very comfortable and the rooms new and very clean. The staff were so helpful and friendly. There is a casino if you would like to gamble a bit, as well as a nice restaurant with an outdoor patio by the lake with very good food. In the morning they said they had a free continental breakfast. It was one of the best of our trip with eggs, sausage or bacon, biscuits and gravy, as well as the usual fruits, cereals, rolls, juices, teas and coffees. We actually got reservations for our return trip as well, we liked it so well. We would definitely stay here again! Room Tip: Ask for a lakeside room. We especially liked the first floor. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"A solidly-good chain hotel with a very reasonable restaurant/lounge in the hotel and a breakfast bar. Ours was a one-night stay for a concert in Mission, but we would certainly come back again. Room Tip: Even the rooms facing south (the highway) are reasonably quiet. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Fantastic service, great breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms, easy to get to, close to Sports and Entertainment Centre. Excellent communication with Kim the Director of Sales and Marketing when planning our team's trip to Cheerfest. Our Cheer team will definetly be back next year."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 days while attending the Torry Pines Open. The hotel was in a great location and was about a 3 block walk to the beach. We could walk to the hotels and shopping. There is a lovely Japanese restaurant on the site and the food and service were excellent. The happy hour offers half price drinks and appitizers. The free breakfast was typical of hotel fare and didn't have a great selection of fresh fruit, but was adequate. The pool area was large and very clean. The rooms were large and clean and the beds were very comfortable. My husband has a bad back so this is important to our stay."
POSITIVE,"Our family of two adults and two teens stayed here for a week on spring vacation. The property was easy to find and centrally located as a starting point for driving north to the LA area or south to San Diego. (about 25 miles from the SD airport) The breakfast was quite adequate and the serving dishes promptly restocked during the busy time of the morning by the pleasant attendent. We had a double queen room that was very spacious and we enjoyed the large balcony. There were quite a number of guests but our room was quiet and comfortable. The beds felt great after busy days of sight-seeing. It was a little cool during our stay but we did use the pool and hot tub once and they were both well kept and enjoyable. The bathroom for our room was clean but the fixtures a little bit dated and fair to poor water pressure in the shower - a minor issue. There is a nice parking garage with convenient elevator access. Overall, we would definitely recommend this lovely hotel."
NEUTRAL,"After a long day on the road, this was a good place to stop. We arrived late and left early so did not use the pool or other amenities which were explained on check in. Very helpful and friendly staff. The ""breakfast"" was a continental with kid friendly cereal, pastries and bread for toast. Not much appealed to us so had a yogurt cup and left. Room Tip: Ask for a second floor room. This helps avoid the headlight glare as people come and go from the parking lot where the lights would shine directly into your room as parking is not assigned by room."
NEGATIVE,"Based on prior reviews, we were expecting a true 3.5-star hotel. It feels more like a 2-star motel, a very poor value for the price. When you walk in you feel like you're in a Super 8. We travel with a dog so couldn't get a room with king-size bed; all the dog-friendly rooms are doubles. It kind of bites that we had to pay extra for our dog, who did no harm to this unsavory room. Here are some specific observations: 1. Poor room maintenance: Carpet was stained; the faucet leaks so badly it floods the counter, and the desk had dried food bits on it. Coffee maker reeked of old coffee, not sure when it was last thoroughly cleaned. 2. No thermostat. It has one of those old-fashioned heaters on the exterior wall under the window with a hot-to-cold slider, which would be OK (not great but OK) if it worked but it seemed to have only cold or hot, nothing in between. 3. Blackout curtains don\u2019t do a good job. Light leaked in around the edges and there was no way to adjust them to eliminate that. 4. Bed and linens were OK. Bed was a bit hard for my taste but at least it didn\u2019t sag. 5. TV had few channels and a fuzzy picture. I haven\u2019t seen fuzzy TV since we stopped using rabbit ear antennas! 6. Wi-fi performance really slow. In the morning I couldn't connect; they had to send a technician who called their support line. Then, without them doing anything, magically it connected. 7. Bathroom tissues are so cheap you can actually hear them crinkle. 8. At checkin, the desk clerk was so distracted she probably never looked at us once. 9. Exterior doors leading directly outside let cold air in every time you have to leave your room. I can't believe this hotel got 3.5 stars. It must be for reasons other than the rooms. Maybe the dog rooms are worse than others, but no matter, I'm definitely not interested in giving this hotel a second chance."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus in Swift Current for two nights in mid January. We were impressed with the obvious renovations and cleanliness of the rooms. They were spacious and very comfortable. Nothing fancy but neither are the rates. The free continental breakfast was quite good, with a bonus waffle maker. The parking is convenient and the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful."
POSITIVE,"This is a very nice hotel right in downtown Boca Raton. I was on my own as I was visiting family. I was checked-in very quickly as they already had keys and room assignments ready for all these who had made a reservation. The hotel is rather large and I was given a map by the front desk so I could find my room. There were not many elevators and they are located in the center of the complex. Once you find your room, itâs not so bad. My room was very nicely furnished and was very clean. The king sized bed was very comfortable. The hotel provided free bottled water and snacks which was a nice touch. The bathroom was fine and featured a tub/shower combination and a toilet. The sink was located outside of the bathroom. There is a nice pool area here and I wish I had more time to use it. The hotel is right next to a seafood restaurant. I had lunch there and it was very good. It appears to be more of a dinner establishment but the prices of the lunch specials cannot be beat. The hotel offers a free breakfast. The quality of the food was fair and nothing to be too excited about. It had scrambled eggs and bacon along with breads and cereals. The coffee was fine and there were different types of juices to choose from. Itâs ok if you want a quick bite before leaving the hotel. The hotel has free parking and the lot filled up as the night went on. I had to park around the back but I did get a spot with no trouble. The short walk to my room didnât hurt. I enjoyed my stay even though it was only for one night. At least I know of a nice place to stay when in Boca and I am there at least once a year. Iâll be back for sure."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is maintained well with small guest rooms. Valet parking is expensive like all other hotels in San F. It's best to park and not drive while downtown. But on your way to/from downtown, drive over and around the Golden Gate Bridge to get views of the bay and ocean and walk out on the pedestrian walkway. The hotel is across the street from Safeway and close to a wide range of eating choices from Subway to gourmet seafood. The sea lions that hang out around Pier 39 close by are comical!"
POSITIVE,This is a charming hotel in the heart of town. Loved the gas fireplace and the wine and cheeses party. Breakfast the usual BW fare. Underground parking(fee) with elevator made it easy to unpack and get to room. Definitely an upscale BW
NEUTRAL,"The BW Victorian Inn in Monterey is not a boutique hotel, as their advertisements claim. Its rooms are more similar to those of a motel. The rooms are clean and spacious enough, but they are dated and tired. The furnishings are old and worn (the chairs even had torn covers); the TV a curved-screen relic from decades past, with poor quality cable reception to match; the dresser/armoire old, unappealing, and cheap. The walls and floors, especially the bathroom floor, need attention. The location is good, and the grounds are nicely landscaped, but if not for Michelle's and Mary's service at the front desk, this would have earned two stars. Room Tip: For a good room, go to Hotel Pacific"
POSITIVE,"Quite a good inclusive breakfast, including hot food, good juice and coffee, which we ate outside in very pleasant surroundings. We stayed three nights, convenient for meeting up with our son studying at UCSB. Pros: A good breakfast! Location: Close to UCSB"
POSITIVE,"Initially, we stayed at this hotel en route to Cambria, and were so impressed with the ambience and service that we returned a week later for another visit. We were in the old inn section of the hotel, and it was very well done in period pieces decor; the bathroom was thoroughly modern; the gas fireplaces in each room were positively delightful. The afternoon wine and cheese reception was an added surprise, and the breakfast was more than to be expected. We would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it highly to anyone seeking lodging in Monterey."
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Bowery Hannbee was very clean and comfortable and staff were helpful, including advice on how to get 1/2 rice tickets to Yankee Stadium!!. Good bathroom. We stored our luggagge for a small fee whilie we went away for the weekend. It is great to get breakfast included. Close to the subway we found it easy to get around. We knew what to expect of the neighbourhood, being the Bowery and the edge of Chinatown. We enjoyed two restaurants recommended by a famous Australian Chef, one almost next door, and the other closeby. Happy with the fruit vvendors and the chinese drugstore over the road. Loved it and would recommend it to any travellers to NYC."
POSITIVE,"Nicest hotel of our two week vacation. Lobby, hallways, pool & breakfast area were all clean and nicely decorated. The pool was comfortably warm and a nice size for a family, and being open 24 hours is nice when you arrive late in the evening. (The pool is located right off the lobby and away from the guest rooms). The room was clean and spacious, but it helped that they gave us a free upgrade to a kitchen suite as part of the Best Western Rewards program. For those who want to watch TV, it was a the largest wide screen we've seen in a room. The breakfast was also the best of our vacation, with some of the usual hotel items, although this hotel provided a selection that was fresh and delicous. There were also hot items such as eggs and biscuits & gravy. The breakfast room was also open later than some hotels have been. If we lived closer and were looking for a weekend getaway, this would be a possible destination!"
POSITIVE,These hotels are all the same quite comfortable with the usual amenities. As they are the only ones close by with all the restuarants it is not too bad.
POSITIVE,"Just left a ""higher end property in Lake Oswego"" to this I-5 hotel and can say for the money I am impressed. The noise isn't bad at all and the room was clean. All I can add for improvement would be to improve the coffee, get rid of the old hospital chemical smell in the lobby, move the smokers to the back side of the property and fix the door hinges so that the heavy metal doors don't slam."
POSITIVE,"This is the third time we have stayed at Ocean Reefs Best western, and the second this year. As other reviewers have noted the central location is great and it is handy to just about everywhere on the Outer Banks. The hotel is showing its age a little, but for the value it cannot be beat. We arrived early and appreciated the front desk taking our cell number and calling as soon as our room was ready. The beach seems to have changed a little since the hurricane and it seems a little steeper. All in all a great stay."
POSITIVE,"Room was good, service was good. The location is great as several things are within walking distance from the hotel. We also got the pass to private beach which is great as the public ones were crowded. Also the breakfast was better than the typical hotel breakfast as it was actually served in the onsite full-service restaurant. Granted it wasn't the best breakfast we ever had, but it was definitely better than we expected. Given the overall values we received, we will be back again when we are in the area."
POSITIVE,"Our room was a nice king size bed room with a small sofa that is nice for relaxing instead of just lying on the bed. Also, supplying a continental breakfast was a plus.Pros: Easy access from freeway. Cons: A little far from restaurants."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for 1 night with a couple of kids. Our room had an indoor balcony which overlooked the pool and waterslide area. Very neat. The waterpark was great. Wsnt huge, had just one slide, but was created in a mountain type setting and was lots of fun (even for me!). Rooms were ordinary hotel rooms, clean, nice, comfy bed. Hd everything we needed. Would have been good for a longer stay too. Lovation is good but is about a 5 or 10 minute drive from thedowntown core."
POSITIVE,"Make no mistake, this is just a Best Western. We're not talking a luxury chain. So, for upscale-economical, what makes it a great value is it's location, size and riverside balconies. First, it's location is right on the Columbia Gorge with a view that's usually taken by that luxury chain. And even if you don't choose a riverside room, there is a nice hotel patio to take in the Gorge when the weather's good including benches and chairs scattered along the walkway between the hotel and the river to sit and ponder. Secondly, the size is smaller for a chain hotel which means easy free parking and no schlepping of suitcases to your room at the very end of the farthest wing. Lastly, not all economy chains even have windows that open for fresh air so I consider it a positive amenity that this hotel offer's riverside rooms with balconies and chairs at no extra charge if they're not already booked (just request it). That said, it's still just a Best Western so I don't want to build it up too much. Room Tip: Not all riverside rooms have the balcony so request it when you book it at no additional charge.

NEUTRAL,"The price was right but it had torn carpet, our room and our friends room wreaked of smoke and the hot tub was taken out and replaced by a patch of grass. But the breakfast was decent, the bed was comfortable and the staff was very nice."
POSITIVE,Very Nice Rooms! Apparently the hotel has renovated their rooms. Nicely up to date and it is just 5 minutes away from Memphis. Had a grand experience. I will definitely come back here next time I come to the Memphis area. Liked: Rooms
POSITIVE,"it was a great experiance to stay with this hotel nice accomadtion and good food,staff of this hotel is very helpful and this hotel is having very good location too.when ever i will be in edmonton i will stay with this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Stayed 17 days on my business trip at this great hotel and wow what beautiful scenery all around this hotel, mountains all around. Had a great room, great staff, always let us use their breakfast room at nite, just anenjoyable stay thank you... Room Tip: Call ahead"
POSITIVE,"Great stay. Hotel is in great shape with very friendly staff. I can't say enough good things about the courteous shuttle driver, Darryl. Lena at the front desk was great and very helpful. On time and prompt drop off and pick up at the airport before and after our vacation in Florida. Clean and comfy beds and fast high speed internet. Nice pool and hot tub. Very competitive rates and good Park N Fly package. I am very picky with hotels and was very satisfied with this one. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,Room was clean. Bathtub was more of a bathtub shower stall. You could hear the airplanes taking off. The pool was under renovation. The continental breakfast was a little better than most. Hotel staff brought a rollaway bed pretty quickly. I would stay here again. It was a good value.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for one night in mid August and then 8 nights in September due to hurricane Irene becuase of flight cancellations. The hotel is very well maintained and the housekeeping staff keeps it spotless. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are well cared for. The rooms would benefit by adding a microwave and a better TV with better channel selections. The free breakfast is well done, waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits, cereral, toast, bagels, juice, coffee, tea, etc. It's best to get there early beacuse the late risers stream in after 9 and the place fills up fast and food bins empty and silverware disappears. The breakfast area also serves as a dining room for dinner and I have to say it's one of the best hotel restuarants I've eaten in. The portions are large and the meals are VERY inexpensive. The two waitresses that served us the 4 times we ate there were the nicest people you could ask to meet. As others have noted, the location is in a semi-industrial area so having a car is a must. There is an IHOP nearby and a Safeway, both within walking distance. Other than that, you're out of luck. The free shuttle is great too, they'll take you to the airport where you can catch the light rail into Seattle and they will also drop you off at a couple of nice restuarants near the airport, 13 Coins and Sharps. Tip the guy a few bucks whenever you ride...they do a great job. I held off giving them 5 stars because we had called ahead the first time we stayed there to make sure we had a roll-away bed in our room since there were 5 of us and when we arrived (at 11:30PM) there was no roll-away bed and none were available. My son had to sleep on the floor on numerous blankets and pillows. They did give us a discount for our troubles though. The jets taking off and landing can be an annoyance at night but I think SeaTac suspends flights overnight. The business center is a good addition too allowing you to use a computer to work or book/confirm flights and print out boarding passes. Room Tip: Get to breakfast early....have a car if you want to go places. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Had to come to Seattle on business for an extended stay and chose this hotel based on cost and convenience. When I got here, I found a great room with a very comfortable bed and a staff that is more than accommodating. The room was quiet, even being relatively close to the south end of the runway for the airport. If you have to come to the SeaTac area, this is a great value that delivers comfortable surroundings. Room Tip: West wing on the interior courtyard is best"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night as we were passing through the Langley area. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were much nicer than we were expecting for the price. There was a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, large television. We had no complaints about noise; our room was quiet. We had no issue with the $3 parking charge, as it was clearly listed when we booked on Expedia. The bathroom was small but clean and functional; no issues with hot water or anything. When checking in we were given a code for free wireless Internet. They are presently doing some renovations and appear to be installing an elevator to service the second floor (carrying our bags up the one flight of stairs was not a problem for us). The hot buffet breakfast starting at 7:00am was a real treat (fruit, muffins, toast, sausage, scrambled eggs, hash browns, cereal, juice, coffee, tea....). There are several restaurants (pizza, burgers, doughnut shop, Vietnamese, etc) and a grocery store within less than a five minute walk. After a very long day it was nice to be able to have these things so close and not having to go out in search of food. I would definitely stay here again. :-)"
POSITIVE,"I hadn't expected much from a Holiday Inn Express -- I thought it would be a typical, cheap, standard disappointment like so many other typical, cheap, standard hotels. This facility in Encinitas was a very pleasant surprise. Clean, professional, high quality rooms. I'd come back in a minute -- the room rate was truly competitive, and I had a pleasantÂ stay."
POSITIVE,we have stayed there before and the beds are nice but the breakfast went down hill from the last time we stayed not very good at all
POSITIVE,"The room was clean, things were in good working order and it was quiet. There was a large high school track meet in town and we thought things would be noisy but it was great. The breakfast was good with a good variety of choices. Would recommend the place to anyone."
POSITIVE,"We just spent 5 nights here at the BW Canyon Pines while visiting our son and his wife who are both in the USAF and stationed @ nearby Hill AFB. This is our fifth stay at the Canyon Pines and once again, it was outstanding. We enjoy the location, which is near everything, but very peaceful and quiet. The staff from top to bottom is wonderful and so very helpful. Chilly evenings were spent relaxing in the pool and woderful hot tub. Truly cannot think of anything that is close to being negative about the BW Canyon Pines. As long as our son and daughter-in-law are stationed @ Hill AFB, this is where we will be staying while in the area. TOP NOTCH!"
POSITIVE,"Nice rooms and really nice staff. A great place for families. They even have free Wi-Fi! Liked: Rooms, Service, Value"
NEUTRAL,"Room was clean, air worked great as it was a hot muggy day. Storm with 70 mile per hour winds went through town around 1:30 am wiping out power to most of the city and downing 100 year old trees like they were toothpicks. Hotel did not have back-up generator, so by 6:oo am room was muggy, had to get up. Did provide breakfast at a restaurant 3 miles away, felt they should have offered a free nights stay at their hotel or another Best Western, but mother nature doesn't always play fair. Security was great, 25-50 Highway Patrol Officers there as security for the State Fair."
POSITIVE,"I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and the maintenance of the facilities. The room was kept up very well with nearly new furnishings. The free breakfast is excellent and exceeds the Marriott ""continental breakfast"" by a long shot. They serve french toast, biscuits and gravy, eggs, breakfast meats, fresh fruits and juice, tasty red brkfast [?] potatoes not just cooked frozen hash browns. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family for short stays"
POSITIVE,Nice hotel they gave us a free room upgrade. Pretty decent free breakfast.
POSITIVE,"On August 27th 2011 we held our 30th Wedding Anniversary reception and party and in the Baronald Suite of the Cartland Bridge Hotel. The hotel and grounds are stunning and the interior of the hotel is very well presented and did not suffer from that old rundown look so often seen in other hotels of this type and age. In the weeks prior to the function the Manager (Mr Robert Duncan) went out of his way to help and be of assistance, and the staff at the hotel were fantastic and extremely helpfull at all times. Our function was held in the Baronald Suite and when guests arrived at the hotel all were greeted by the staff with a glass of champagne and a lot of smiles. We booked a package at the hotel which included drinks for all guests on arrival, a glass of wine with dinner and for the toasts. It also included a 4 course meal with good choices from the menue and the food and the service was excellent. I should also mention that as well as our function taking place there was also a Wedding fuction being hosted at the same time in another suite (the Lanimer Suite), and we feel that all due credit should be given to the hotel and staff for coping admirably with these both functions simultaneously, Excellent Service!! The value for money, service and food were all excellent and everything went according to plan with the help from the hotel manager and his staff. All our guests commented on the great atmosphere, food and service. Based on our experience with this hotel and staff we would highly recommend it to anyone for functions or similar events. We cannot comment on the bebrooms/ accomodation as we did not require the use of them for our function."
NEUTRAL,"My family stayed for three nights. We enjoyed the breakfast which provided a nice variety. The location is in a safe area within walking distance to shopping, places to eat, and near our family and friends. The movies and an outdoor mall are just a short drive. One set-back: Although we reserved a non-smoking room in advance, there were not any available when we arrived. My father booked directly with the hotel the same day and was able to get the last non-smoking room. Their response to this was, ""It is a request not a guaranty when you do not book directly with the hotel."" Fortunately, my father did not have a problem with the smoke room and switched with my family. Both rooms were clean and comfortable during our stay. The hallway does carry a strong smoking scent, but it was not unbearable."
POSITIVE,"From the moment my daughter and I checked into this Hotel we were beyond satisfied. Polite, friendly, knowlegeable staff. Nice lobby, clean rooms. Great breakfast. Free internet. Location is wonderful near all restaurants and shops etc. We would definately go back to this Hotel."
POSITIVE,Staff is very friendly and very professional location is good across from Marina Hotel is clean Physically the Hotel need some refurbishing such as carpets are showing their age.The buildingYou can hear some water running Not completely sound proofThe Internet is not great and you have to resign on after so many minutesI would recommend this hotel for the dollar valueRonRichmond Bc Pros: Friendly staff Cons: Internet slow Location: Good location
NEGATIVE,"I could not recommend the Kelly Inn Best Western to anyone. While our rooms were satisfactory, two experiences were matters of concern, and the staff's inability/unwillingness to address the problems was disconcerting to say the least. First of all, the night we checked in, two people- loudly arguing -were standing in the middle of the second set of doors to enter the hotel.They were oblivious to my request to enter the lobby. To make matters worse, the man who checked us in commented that he would ask them to leave after he was finished with us. Obviously, the argument had ensued well before we entered the hotel. It doesn't speak well for hotel management that staff isn't trained to know what to do in a situation like this. To make matters worse, on the second night of our stay, just before 3 a.m., I was awakened by a loud and insistent pounding at the door to my room. Accompanied by the pounding was his insistence that I let him in. It was clear to me that he had been drinking an whoever he was looking for, was in for trouble. from the other side of the door, I yelled at him at least three times that he had the wrong room. He continued pounding with his fist. At that point, I used the hotel phone to call for assistance from the desk. The phone rang at least 20 times, but no one ever answered. The next morning when I asked for the manager, he told me that the manager wasn't available. So I told him what had happened (including the fact that I had seen the very same man just a few minutes earlier at another room door several doors from my room). Curiously, there wasn't a reassuring response. No ""I'm.sorry"" or I will follow through investigating the problem. Instead, he replied that maybe my room phone was out of order because the hotel has 24 hr. security and there is always somebody at the desk. Incredible! When I returned to the hotel later that evening, after a funeral, by the way; I stopped at the desk to inquire of the same person what his manager had to say. ...Pros: Rooms were clean. Cons: When there was a need for security staff, no one responded. Then, the front desk staff essentially ignored my concerns."
POSITIVE,"If you're looking for a nice place to stay near San Diego with your pet, this is it. Webster the Wonder Kitty had an early morning vet appointment on Claremont Mesa Blvd, about 20 minutes from this hotel. Rather than driving from Indio to San Diego at that hour, we decided to get a room nearby. Good decision. Our standard room with two queen beds was very nice and clean. Clean, comfortable bed and pillows. They have quite a a few DVDs in the office that you can borrow, as well as HBO etc. Free WiFi. Very friendly and helpful staff. Free breakfast, not the best I've ever eaten, but fresh, tasty, and adequate considering the moderate cost of the room. For a pet friendly place near San Diego I have a feeling this is as good as it gets. We would stay here again even if we were not traveling with a pet."
NEUTRAL,"Mediocre. Had to wait for hotel staff to finish a private conversation before they would even acknowledge me. The place seemed clean enough, but rather run down, worn carpet and dull color. Continental breakfast began promptly at 6:00 and offered a good breakfast selection. The neighborhood is rather dingy but there was an excellent Chinese restaurant next door, the Hunan Palace (slow service but top rate food). The hotel does have lots of parking and noise level at night was minimal, access to the freeway extremely easy. All in all, I'd say slightly less than average, given the price of the room."
POSITIVE,"Large rooms, quiet, very clean and well-maintained, lovely grounds, right off the main highway to Nogales and northern Mexico. Priced right, including breakfast. Helpful staff. Biggest bonus for me was their pet policy- cats and small dogs in the room for only an extra $10 a night."
POSITIVE,"I was so surprised at how nice the place was for the money. The best value we have had in a long time. Already recommended to all my friends. You don't have to get in your car, we didn't. We walked to everything. So convenient. The continental breakfast was not your typical fruit and a bagel. You could make your own waffles, toast, cereal and so on. [?] We had adjoining rooms and they were both very modern and nice, clean. Thank you for proving to us that you don't have to spend a fortune to get an excellent stay these days!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is clean and has a breakfast that needs more attention - it is too popular and ran out of chairs, orange juice, etc. for a while. The bathroom needs a bit of replacing - some old tiles and some done sloppily. It is also on a very busy street that makes it hard to get to the 401. Generally, though, it is a pretty good spot."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was clean and quiet. The carpet in the hallways was in desperate need of replacing. The common areas of the hotel smell old. The food in the restaurant was ok, but food choices when I checked in at night are limited in this town of 9,000. There was an older tv in the room. There is a desk to work at and also a small table in a large bedroom. There is no elevator in this hotel so you have to carry your suitcases up the stairs. There is a business center in the lobby. The pool looked clean. I was surprised at the high cost of the room here in the middle of the prairie."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was perfectly located. It was near or not to far from every major attraction; malls, restaurants, south beach, and stores. The service was great, someone was always at the desk working and they had night security guards. Staying was one less thing I had to worry about."
POSITIVE,"The bedding was stark white and super clean and comfy. The grounds are Breathtaking, with its many fountains and trees. I can't complain about a single thing! Ideal location less than 30 min form the city, less than 10 min from the airport and rental car locations. Kohls, mcdonalds right across the street. The beds in this hotel are Beautifully done up. The Bedding is so pretty and lush and comfortable, stark white, and it just feels looks and feels so clean. The bed was really comfortable as well. We got a great nights sleep after our long day of traveling and sightseeing. the location is so easy and convenient to any and everything in and around the airport and San Fran. I originally booked a different Best Western in Pacifica, but changed it due to location. and I am so glad I did. I will go back (and did in fact the night before our return flight we chose this hotel again). The breakfast (departure snack is what they call it) was good, Fresh made muffins, croissants, ham and cheese puffs, fresh fruit, bagels, toast and oatmeal. The pool was closed apparently since we went in january (was filled but couldn't be used) we were sad about that since being from WI, 68 degrees isn't cold for us :) All in all this is a great hotel, for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, quiet and inexpensive hotel. I highly highly recommend it!!"
NEGATIVE,"My hotel experience was horrible. The hotel is old and in no condition for anyone to stay in. I would need much more than a few paragraphs to describe it. The phones don't work,the furnishings are old broken. The heater sounds like a truck all night keeping you up. And in addition to keeping you up, you have construction crews working on the outside of the building that nstart at about 7:30 in the morning. They were installing styrofoam to the exterior of the building and most of the styro was inside the room, even in the towels. I requested a non-smoking room, but a mistake was made by mgmt. or someone on-line and we had to stay in a smoking room that smelled so bad that I had to go out and buy a bottle of Febreeze to be able to breathe. They gave me an air purifier one day and that evening when we returned it was gone but replaced by a small 3"" bottle of pot-pouri that was in a can that was rusty. Don't want to speculate when that was used last! The room was so small that when my husband was sitting on a chair by the desk I had to jump over the bed to get to the bathroom...Shall I go on, I think you get the message.I wouldn't let my worst enemy stay there. Pros: the free morning breakfast buffet. Cons: everything else. Location: The location is in Rockville Ctre. which is a lovely town on Long Island."
NEUTRAL,"I was in the Hillcrest area of San Diego for work and I needed a place for just one night. I don't need anything fancy - just a clean room with your basic cable channels and internet. I liked the cleanliness of the room and overall it was verycomfortable. I also liked the free parking. The only downer was that the wireless internet was choppy. But it was free as well so I guess I can't complain. Although if I had to do serious work I'd be really angry about it. Overall, this place exceeded my needs. Good motel for the location/price."
NEUTRAL,Nice clean comfortable room with a good location.
POSITIVE,"Had 2 queen sized beds that had both plump pillows and mattresses. The rooms were amazingly large w/2 seating areas and super clean. The continental breakfast was far better than most. The 2 fellows we dealt with at the front desk were a hoot, kept us laughing. And they have those warm cookies... My roomate used the free wi-fi and I used the computer down in the lobby. They gave us a great rate for our Presbyterian conference. Would highly recommend this place!"
POSITIVE,"Have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The location is great, the area is good, parking is easy, front desk employees are very nice and helpful and rooms are clean and inexpensive. I like this place and will continue to stay here."
POSITIVE,Great hotel! Room was very comfortable and decorated nicely. The bed was comfortable and the location was quiet. The hotel staff were friendly and accomodating. I will definitely stay there again if in the area and will definitely recommend it to others.
POSITIVE,"We stayed only one day, but the hotel, was nice, clean, the beds very comfortable, the continental breakfast better that the usual and management is also very helpful. Room Tip: This hotel also allows smoking, so staying in the second floor helps. In the second floor the noisy and the cigaret smell decreases."
POSITIVE,"If you're just staying a short while and looking for a location close to the airport at an affordable price you should definitely consider the Best Western Freeport Inn. It's not luxurious, but its certainly clean and comfortable. Rooms are spacious, microwaves and refridgerators are provided and the complimentary breakfast has a good range of hot and cold food. There is free access to the business centre for guests so you can catch up on emails or arrange airport check-in etc. . Its also very close to a number of car hire providers. If you're staying in Calgary longer and you don't have access to a car you'd find a downtown location much more convenient, but be prepared to pay more, and if you've got a car, you can expect to pay some hefty parking charges downtown."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here in December 2011 after a flight. The hotel was clean and tidey, There was a pub which was nice. It is also quiet in the rooms given how close to the freeway it is. The best part was the included transportation to the airport. They also allowed us to park our car there for a week before we stayed. The indoor pool is nice given the weather here in December. Will stay again on our next trip."

POSITIVE,The people were amazing. This hotel treats every guest like a special guest. I will return. Was sad to say goodbye.
POSITIVE,"Hotel was great, breakfast hot and ready, good location, friendly staff. Very nice stay. No problems at all."
POSITIVE,Gra5 location for an overnight stay off of I-75. Attendants at the desk were really friendly and efficient. The two double bed room we stayed in was clean and included a microwave and refrigerator. The beds were nice and firm and the room was quiet. Room Tip: The Paddock Mall is only about a mile or two away and their are several restaurant choices near there too.
POSITIVE,"We were attending an event at Warner Brothers studios so we decided to pick this Best Western because it is only about six miles away from the studio. (We arrived about four hours prior to check-in time and they got us a room right away.) The property is beautiful, the front desk staff pleasant and helpful (with directions on getting onto the freeway to Burbank), the room was clean and spacious. It is right next to a Dennys Diner where we had three excellent meals with great service. Overall, we were very pleased with the experience. There are a couple downsides, first being that it is right off the 405 freeway which creates a continuous hum of traffic. It's not really that bad -- more like loud white noise that helped drown out the gaggle of giggling girls that checked in next door at about 11:00 p.m. one night without any inkling that -- yes, at that hour -- people would be trying to sleep. The sound of these neighbors came through the doors that could link our two rooms. The doors were so thin (or the sealing around the doors so poor) that it sounded like these giggling girls were in our room. The inconsiderate guests next door is not the fault of the hotel; but the poor soundproofing around those doors is. That said, we enjoyed our two nights and would definitely stay again."
NEUTRAL,"We booked a room here because we were going to a concert at Ironstone Vineyards and nothing was available in Murphys. We booked a poolside room and found it to be quiet and very comfortable. The room is what you would expect from a Best Western: basic and clean. I do think it was a touch overpriced, but if you add up the extras they give you: a social hour with appetizers and drinks, free breakfast (a real one), plus a free drink or dessert if you have dinner at the restaurant, then the cost seems more reasonable. When we checked in they were extremely busy and the staff seemed overwhelmed. Some of the customers seemed to be getting frustrated but the staff always kept their cool and were sincerely apologetic for the delay. I might stay here again. It was not a very long drive to Murphys and was just a short drive to downtown Sonora."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was exactly what we expected from a Best Western: good, neat, clean and comfortable. The staff was very nice and the room was a good size with a comfortable bed and ample room for our luggage. The location is good since it's right by the highway but still quiet. We were hiking in the area and we liked being at a relatively convenient distance from trails but also close to Sonora, which offers a greater choice of restaurants and shops for the evenings. The slight downside in my opinion is that breakfast is served at a restaurant near the hotel and not as a buffet at the hotel itself, but the food was also decent and the restaurant is right across from the hotel entrance. Overall we felt that we received a good value for our money and would come back if we decide to go hiking in the area again."
POSITIVE,"quiet & comfortable room, great bed none very accessible from the I-10 This was one of my most pleasant hotel experiences - EVER. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, comfortable room, wonderful bedding and a good, quiet's night of sleep. Nothing to be improved on - I will definitely stay here again. The location was very convenient just off the I-10, close to Ikea!"
NEGATIVE,"Only stopped because was falling asleep on road-arrived around 7pm.Went to sleep and awoke @3am to ants biting me. They were even in my purse,all over the coffe machine,the desk. When called the Front Desk offered to move to another room.Stayed in my car till 7am. Wanted to speak w/Manager who didnt show for work-was ?sick. They acutally have a rate for those who complain about the ant-decrease your rate. Now I only stayed in the room from 7pm to 7am they stayed around for a manager who never showed. I did take pictures and videos. as the daylight comes the ants do seem to receed but they are still there just not in abudance. I did take them home with me, 2 days later was still finding them.They had nerve to say people were bringing the ants in!"
NEUTRAL,The room was very nice and clean with all the amenities. Breakfast was great with much to choose from and the staff was courteous. Loved the valet parking but felt the neighborhood was iffy.
POSITIVE,"Pool and breakfast area was separate from the building our room was in, so we had to walk outside and up a hill to get there - didn't use pool for that reason. Also had an outdoor pool, but it was closed because of cold weather. Rooms all had outside entrances. Enjoyed the campfire on the beach and roasting marshmallows in the evening. Our room was very large and clean. We could see Mackinac Island from the beach. Nice big play area for children with swings, slide, etc. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was suffricient, with a nice view of Lake Huron."
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hotel. The staff were very friendly, and the rooms were comfortable , nicely decorated and had everything we needed. The complimentary breakfast was very good. The pool area was a great surprise, as it has a section just for the kids. the lounge area around the pool was great and had we had more [?] time, we would have spent time out there. The only downside was that the water was not very warm, so we were hardly in the water at all. The only thing I would recommend is to request a room that is not right next to the laundry facilities for the hotel staff if you are a light sleeper-- it was a little loud at times but the staff did what they could to accommodate our complaints."
POSITIVE,Perfect location. Faces Universal Studios.
NEUTRAL,O.K. Hotel. Terrible shuttle service on arrival. Waited 1-1/2 hours and 4 phone calls to Hotel before shuttle showed up.
POSITIVE,"On arrival the desk clerk asked if I wanted to up-grade without being asked.The room and the view was perfect,over looking a small park and the bay. Beds were comfortable and the room was very clean and quiet."
POSITIVE,So amaizing i really like the hotel very nice location on the front of the rooms are walk beach and also beach in the back is Marina if u have a car it's near everything i stayed in more than 5 hotels while i'm having my trip in USA and while i'm now in Las Vegas i'll telling u if i will visit those area again i will stay in same hotels but in next [?] time will be more than the 4 nights i stayed good place for relax and who love beach
NEUTRAL,"Room was small and the hotel decoration is dated. Hotel staff were helpful and courteous. The location was excellent!!! you can walk to and from the fisherman's wharf and the surrounding pier. Hotel was also close to nearby affordable restaurants like IHOP and Denny's and the best of all it was just across Safeway, so you can buy some grocery items like water, bread and snacks that the hotel would charge you double if you use the bar or order room service. The bus stop is just on the other side of the street so buying a city pass, 3-day pass or 7 day pass is well worth it as u can use it in any city transportation except for the bart. We always take the cable car which is just one block from our hotel when we go back and fort from our hotel to downtown."
POSITIVE,This is a quaint hotel with lots of character....making you feel right at home even making sure your pets are comfortable they have a bowl put out with doggie treats - a very nice touch. Every evenning they serve wine in the reception area where you can mingle with other guests and again feel at home. Location is excellent close to everything you could possibly want to do. We travel quite frequently and I have to say this has been one of my favourites. Just a very relaxing - welcoming feeling. WE LOVED IT
POSITIVE,"Close to all visitors attractions. Concierge, Car parking great for tourist the wireless access is good, the valet parking efficient but not cheap. The double bed room lacks one foot in width. The location is perfect for visiting the bay and Columbus street or Chinatown, using the famous cable car or short walk."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was in a great location on Fisherman's Wharf - it was nice to be out of the city centre with the major attractions still within walking distance. The room was very nice and really clean. I had a great stay here, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco. The staff were also very helpful and attentive. There is not a bad thing I can say about this hotel. Pros: Everything Cons: Nothing - Would be nice if breakfast was included. Location: Amazing - Close to everything."
POSITIVE,"Great Place to stay, clean and people are so nice, the lady at the desk and breakfast area, plus the lady who helped with our tickets you could not ask for better treatment. I hope the owners appreciate them.They are why people keep coming back.."
NEUTRAL,"Good location, decent enough place to stay. Older building with the need of some updates that are common in newer hotels. The plug-in outlets are far and few between, need more for cell phone, laptops etc. If your just staying for a place to sleep, it's good enough and clean. If you need to do some work on your computer, - the free internet is slow, and the ""desk"" is not up to the task. Overall, ""o.k."". - Best part, it was very clean."
NEUTRAL,Very nice hotel HOWEVER the location of the room I received was unsatisfactory. There is a ramp access to the Shelter Island Marina - the room I was given (#137) was adjacent to the access way. Noisey traffic throughout the day and into theevening. A different room away from the access way would have solved the problem. It was a one night stay. A lesson learned.
NEUTRAL,"It was a decent hotel to stay in for the amount of time I've spent there on my trip. The hotel could have provided with more hygienic items needed though, along with other small minor needs. The hotel is good for a one night stay but I wouldn't recommend for a multiple day stay. Overall it is a nice hotel."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was easy to find. Check in was fast and I was prompty waited on. The room was really nice. Two queen beds. The pillows though are something to be desired. I suggest you bring your own or the hotel should switch these pillows out. They are more decorative and useful in my opinion. The bed was too hard for me. My daughter didn't mind it. TheÂ buffet breakfast ....it was okay. Everything was previously frozen flat circle eggs, circle sausages, toast, dry hash browns, ....coffee was plentiful, juices, fresh fruit and cereal. The price wasn't bad either. I'd go back, but I'd go out for breakfast."
POSITIVE,"The stay was Oct.18-22 for business and it was great. The location is about 15 minutes north of the airport but in a good shopping location very close to âEdmonton Commonsâ. The hotel staff were very helpful and smiling all the time. Lobby is welcoming with 2 fireplaces. The free breakfast was well staked and clean. The spacious room was well appointed, and designed for comfort that included fridge and microwave. The only drawback is the location where youâll need to travel by car or taxi to downtown or the West Edmonton Mall, which was not a problem for me. Overall a great place/value to choose this hotel. Iâll definitely choose it again on my next trip to Edmonton."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here on our anniversary trip to Edmonton. We reserved the King suite with the jacuzzi tub and fireplace, and it didn't disappoint! Everything is well taken care of, comfortable and clean. I loved the jacuzzi and the fireplace provided a nice ambiance to the room ( we didn't have the heat on). The bed was very comfortable and the microwave and fridge were definitely a nice addition to the room. We tried the fitness room and while there are not a lot of machines, they're also well taken care of and the water and towels provided were nice to have. The pool area and hot tub looked nice but we didn't try them this trip. As other reviewers have pointed out, the breakfast room is somewhat small and the plastic plates leave something to be desired, however the food was good and plentiful and it saved us from having to go out and find a place and wait for food (and pay for yet another meal!). We will be back again with our kids and on any other trip we go on. Room Tip: We were on the fourth floor which I'd imagine on a weekend would be a bonus due to it being the top floor so you won't hear anyone above you. (not sure if this would be a problem anyways..but..) The jacuzzi room is definately worth the extra $20 a night, pretty sure you have to book that straight off the bestwestern.com site. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,have to admit stayed here because of the price - we were pleasantly surprised! overall it was quiet and very clean. this hotel is conviently located to where we needed to be (my nephews hockey tournament) Easy access to freeways. I would definately stay here again. We only stayed 2 nights - if i had to stay more this would be the place. I cant rate the free breakfast as we did not have the opportunity to eat there. the only negative i would have to included is the room was either too hot or too cold - that i can live with for the price! (that is why i gave the sleep quality a 3 - the bed was great)
POSITIVE,My wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel walking distance from town and this was the only place available. The location is perfect. The room we had showed some age but everything was clean and worked. The price was a little high but I understand it was Oktoberfest weekend. Not much else to say. Stay here with confidence.
POSITIVE,"We loved everything about it & will stay here again when in Ouray. Clean, nice, comfy room & the complimentary breakfast-cooked by a chef-was excellent. Heated pool & hot tub under the stars surrounded by mountains was wonderful. If we had had time we would have stayed another night."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here several times over the past few years. The motel has a good location, easy to get to from the freeway and a few miles from the University of California campus at Davis. It is generally pretty quiet, low-key, and clean. Not a luxury hotel, but the beds are very comfortable, which is important. The included continental breakfast has cold cereal, oatmeal (mix), pastries, make-your-own waffles, yogurt, some fruit, etc., so a good variety--I pretty much eat the same things I eat at home. When I stay there, the other guests have included families on visiting the Davis campus, college sports teams, visiting scholars, and similar travelers. Parking is good, often right next to the room. In one room, the heater was noisy, but when I told the manager as I checked out, he promised to fix it; there were extra blankets in the closet, so I was comfortable. There is a smoking wing and a non-smoking wing. They also have free wireless (a lot better than many expensive hotels!), and the rooms I have been in have had microwaves, sinks, and mini-refrigerators. A very good value overall. I am sure we will stay there again."
POSITIVE,My family and I stayed with the Best Western Ocean Sands...from the cleanliness of the rooms to the hotel staff....1st CLASS....will definately return to this hotel for my next family vacation!!! THANK YOU BEST WESTERN OCEANSANDS FOR THE WONDRFUL ACCOMMODATIONS AND EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!
POSITIVE,Staff was great. Good choice for breakfast. Nothing at all to complain about Easy acess from the airport and Lackland AFB. About 15 min from either one. The entire staff was friendly and efficient. The room was quite large compared to many others I have stayed in. The TVs are not the brand new type of flat screen but worked perfectly. Beds are huge and comfy. 5 pillows on the bed. Everything clean and housekeeping was perfect. No problem with noise.
POSITIVE,nice hotel.......nice area...........
POSITIVE,"I came to the Best Western Grass Valley to attend and participate in the KVMR Celtic Festival. I didn't have musch time to spend at the hotel. After day 1 of the fest, I checked in and things went smoothly. I got a comfortable room right across from the pool. My wife and I went to old town Grass Valley to walk around and have aglass of wine. There are at least three strip mall commercial areas within walking distance. Old Town is 3 exits doen the freeway. The Nevada County Fairgrounds is a short drive. Directly across from the hotel is Paulette's for a ghood breakfast, and 1 block further is Perko's so getting food is easy. PLus, Old Town has some nice dining options. I'd recommend it for cleanliness and convenience."
POSITIVE,"We got the room because it was close to a family members house. Every thing was nice, it was quite when we where there, not too many people around. Did not hear people walking in hallway(I don't like hearing people in the hallway.), so that wasnice. The staff was friendly. I liked the meal vouchers they gave us for breakfast it made the bill very small."
POSITIVE,The hotel was well located to the fair and in a good neighborhood. The saff were very helpful. The rooms were clear and well looked after. Recommended
POSITIVE,I was extremely satisfied with everything this hotel had to offer. The meals were reasonable.
POSITIVE,"Easliy the nicest place we've stayed in our tour so far. The room was good with a little balcony. We didn't have a good lake view, though. More a lake glimpse. There are rooms right by the lake and I wish we'd got one of those. The whole environment of the place was nicely laid out., right by the lake beach on one side and the very pleasant main street on the other. Free wifi in the room. Coin-op laundry was conveniently by the pool and you got a lot of drying time for a dollar. We used the Mama's Tomato restaurant which was pleasant; food was nice and prices reasonable. I don't know how common this is in the US but...........we were sent in the direction of the concierge who was mainly pushing a boat trip, which we took and was quite good. He tells you it's a special rate but you can get the same rate on the internet, and he insists on being paid cash for some reason. I noticed that US citizens were being offered cheaper or free tickets provided they agreed to attend some sort of presentation. I didn't think it was appropriate for the hotel's concierge to be acting as a timeshare rep, but I might be naive. I highly recommend the hotel itself, though. Room Tip: Ground floor lake view rooms are absolutely ideal for beach access See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"The staff was helpful, courteous, and very friendly. The breakfast had a nice variety. The grounds were pretty and the location was perfect for walking to and from Disneyland."
NEUTRAL,"This wasn't a horrible hotel experience but I wouldn't book this one, again. The room was comfortable, no problem with temperature and the housekeeping staff really kept the room clean. But, they do allow pets and even though the room was clean I felt like there had been a guest with a pet in the room because of the smell. I also came away with a couple [?] of flea bites. There was a lot of outside noise and I'm guessing it was because of the proximity to the freeway. Loud truck horns in the middle of the night. It also sounded like there may have been train tracks nearby or at least it sounded like it late at night. I did think the bathroom and vanity area was nicer than the nearby Hilton I stayed at previously so that was a plus. I stayed here four nights and passed on the breakfast after trying it the first day. I really didn't see anything there that I wanted to eat especially the giant fishbowl of hard boiled eggs or the pre-made breakfast burritos and sandwiches that are out of refrigeration. I also have to say that the staff was very friendly and helpful at the motel."
POSITIVE,"We stayed overnight at the Zion Best Western, after driving up from Las Vegas. Overall, the stay was successful. Management was very nice and helpful, there was a free breakfast at the next door restaurant, and the hotel was clean and well appointed. Weaknesses included the noise from people in the hot tub as well as other rooms, and the pillows were [?] not very high quality (too soft and mushy). Our room (210) faced toward the back overlooking the pool/hot tub area. The views were beautiful, the noise was not. Yes, I would stay here again, great location and breathtaking area in general. Pretty good food as well at Jack's sports bar next door."
POSITIVE,"Nice remodeled room. The restaurant is kind of cheesy. They should have left it alone,back when it was a popular Bar n Grill."
POSITIVE,"My stay at this hotel was great. The staff was cheerfull and greated you with a smile. I can't say that happened at other places i've stayed. The location was perfect for me, was easy to get to the highways I needed to travel on. The room was very clean and and neat. The service here was helpfull in many ways. All questions were answered very quickly."
NEGATIVE,"Hard to find anything at all positive about this hotel.Got a great price,but after staying here recently,it really stood out for its negatives.Check in was fine.With 2 staying in the room,there should have been more towels.There was one large one and a couple of medium sized,no wash cloths,one bar of soap.No listings for the tv.These are little things [?] that make astay more enjoyable.Had to find a housekeeper to get supplies.After returning to the room after golf,headed for the shower.The vibration and noise when the shower was turned on shook the room.Oh... and no hot water.We needed a quick room change.After notifying front desk,had to wait about 15-20 minutes and then called the front desk again.They had to inspect the room to verify there was a problem!!!Would we call when we were 2 steps from the shower?The front desk verified that there was a problem and then went back to the front desk to get another room card. Breakfast ok,no fresh fruit...goood waffles though and convenient.Location is good but needs management!!"
POSITIVE,"I read some other reviews about this property stating it is in a shady neighborhood. Not sure what that is all about. The neighborhood is a mix, mostly commercial, but within a block there are Lexus, Lotus, Masserati, Ferrari, BMW dealerships -- not really a shady clientele. The location is very convenient. We did not find any issue with the pillows as one person mentioned. In fact our pillows were very fluffy and lots of them. Nice touches in the rooms. Not overly large or extravagant, but very serviceable. The bathroom area was spacious with lots of little extras (actual mugs for coffee and glass drinkware -- not styrofoam or plastic). Birds weren't the problem for us that some indicated. (They must be VERY light sleepers!) I found they added a nice touch to the whole courtyard, which is beautiful. Pool was closed for maintenance while we were there, but it wasn't really pool weather during our stay anyway (rained 2 days). One problem we had -- our room was on the 2nd floor right about the laundry. In the morning, the vibration from the washers carried through the floor and our beds vibrated right along with it! We found all the staff very nice, polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Not sure I'd call it a resort, but it was a great value, clean, and super location!"
POSITIVE,"Hotel has friendly and very helpful staff and is in a good location to walk along the historic main street, which has some interesting shop and a great book shop, Braun's. There's a good indoor pool too."
POSITIVE,Hotel recommended. Extremely friendly staff. Second straight year and we will return anytime. Dumas family
POSITIVE,"I didn't expect so much because it's best western. But I was surprised with its cleanness and great bed. had very happy 3 days.Pros: I was in tower suite, great bed. Cons: Hallway was very cold."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed in this hotel for convention. Not far from downtown but access is across 4 lane divided highway, very busy at times. Had infestation of ants during stay, staff gave me some spray and an apology. Breakfast was so, so. Housekeeping came two days while we were still in room, never came back so beds were not made and no towel service during our stay. [?] Had to get towels from desk twice. There are other hotels with better location and better service closer to downtown, try the Grand or Hampton Inn."
NEGATIVE,"Let me first say that we stay in hotels over 50 nights a year, and I have NEVER complained about one, but the service here was so terrible, I want everyone to know about it. We booked our room online and had a confirmation number, but when we arrived at 7:00 p.m, we were told the people who were in our room before us didn't check out until after housekeeping had left so it wasn't clean and all they had was a Smoking King room, which wouldn't work for us since we have babies. So, he called the Assistant Manager who came in to clean the room for us while we waited at the pool (we were told it would be about an hour.). TEN MINUTES later, they came and told us our room was clean. We did an initial walk-through to make sure they didn't half [--] the cleaning since it was so quick. We noticed the tub was still dirty and asked him to clean that. He gave us a discount price and left the room. After he left, we pulled back the bedding to put our kids to bed and there were SHORT BLACK HAIRS all over the sheets inside...like pubic hair from someone else and yellow stains. GROSS!!! THEY DIDN'T EVEN CHANGE THE SHEETS!!! We called the lobby to complain but the high school kid running the place said he was the only one on duty, but we could come get the bedding and change it ourselves. HORRIBLE SERVICE! And the horrible nasty, cherry on top was that we awoke at 5:42 AM to someone vacuuming in the room above us. The breakfast was weak...juice machine broken, coffee was burnt tasting and awful. When we complained to the general manager he said that the discount he given us for a late arrival ($50.00) was already so low, he couldn't go any lower, even though most other hotels have a 100% satisfaction gaurantee. You couldn't PAY ME to sleep in someone else's hair! DISGUSTING! Horrible service, not clean, save your money (the rooms are WAY overpriced anyway) and go to the Holiday Inn Express down the street....much better rooms, breakfast, and service, and half the price."
NEGATIVE,The room was nice size and clean. Requested two rooms both non-smoking and next to each other. Only got one non-smoking room and rooms were in different areas of the hotel. Front office staff was not very friendly or willing to help fix the problem.Pros: The room was a good size. Cons: Did not give room that was requested. Non-smoking and rooms not together.
POSITIVE,"Clean rooms, nicely refurbished rooms in comparison to older building look, friendly staff, good breakfast special of $5.99 at Checkers restaurant in the hotel lobby and free wi-fi was pretty good too. The hotel location was good because its right next to many stores and amenities but the general Davie street area had a fair bit of homeless people bothering pedestrians. Also, Davie St is an LGBT-friendly area which normally I'd have no problem with but a combination of homeless people in an lgbt community just didn't mix well. I'll leave it at that. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Outstanding, incredibly helpful staff. Great location, very comfortable and well appointed room. Included breakfast which was a great added bonus (but it was a bit too carbohydrate heavy for my taste)"
POSITIVE,"Went to a concert at the amphitheater and stayed here..... Cute room, quick service, clean, and decent continental breakfast. Location isn't the best area and it is right next to the freeway (but the sound of cars wasn't bad at all). I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"A bit loud, a bit dated, but overall a nice place to stay for the price. Complimentary breakfast is a great bonus. The bar was lively and fun with live music. Conveniently located for driving to nearby shopping, beach, restaurants, etc. Pros: Convenience and price Cons: Noise and decor Location: Good spot"
NEGATIVE,"Room was dirty! Bugs were flying everywhere! Bathroom was disgusting! Mold in the shower and dirt on the bathroom floor. Will never stay here again! Disliked: Rooms, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"We only stayed one night but, at the price we paid it was fine. We found a spot to park on the street even though they do offer valet for $24 a night. The bed was awesome and the room temps were easily controllable. Coffee was just ok and the internet speed varried - sometimes it was too slow. However, for convenience of museum it was a great value. I like great values. Liked: Rooms, Location, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"Spent a ""getaway weekend"" in Buffalo at the Best Western. Hotel is in Allentown neighborhood, next to Elmwood Village. Walking distance to farmer's market, shops, restaurants, museum, etc. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was better than the usual complimentary fare (yoghurt, waffles) and we ate in a pretty nice banquet room; daily papers provided at each table. Sunday paper delivered to the room. Staff was very friendly and helpful making recommendations and printing directions. Two small complaints: no full-length mirror in room and the bathroom is one of those split deals with the sink outside of toilet/tub area."
POSITIVE,The rooms were really nice and clean. It was not dirty at all. I would recommend this hotel if your in the area.
POSITIVE,"The rooms were well sized with good sized bathrooms. Breakfast not as great as others but still good. The staff were the most noticable with the overall helpfulness. At one stage I needed help with my Ipad 2 free internet reception and had someone at my room within minutes and because it couldn't be dealt with straight away, an IT person arranged for the following day. Outlet shopping just down the road and close to freeway access (we didn't notice noise any problem noise)."
POSITIVE,this hotel is very nice - its pricey but its no more expensive than anywhere else in santa barbara. The pool and hot tub are very nice but the hotel is a long walk from the main town. Taxis are plentiful but expensive . Room was clean but we were given a smoking room and i just hate that - there was nothing else available as it was a festival night. coffee etc available for free in reception i would stay here again
POSITIVE,Arrived at 6 pm on a Saturday evening and greeted by a very pleasant young man. Promptly received key and directions to room. Had dinner at a restaurant in the shopping area next to hotel. There is a HEB grocery store and Walgreens Pharmacy there for anything you might have forgotten for your trip. I had a hot breakfast of pancakes and eggs and sausage before stopping for a Starbucks located in the shopping area as I continued on my trip. I felt very safe and secure staying at this Best Western. I highly recommend this place!
POSITIVE,This hotel was definitely a bang for your buck deal!!! Nice clean rooms and the breakfast was great!!! The price was up my alley and the staff was very accommodating. Will definitely go back to this hotel next year.
POSITIVE,Overall I was satisfied. They just need to work on duct cleaning and minor maintenance to the rooms. I will be going back. Nice hotel.
POSITIVE,"Couldn't have asked more, right from arrival till departure. Everything was Meticulously planned, placed . staff was extremely frndly,the rooms including interior are excellent , Neat and clean, Hygiene maintained. Food was alos excellent , actually can write Para's on this but restricting just to write and mention Place , food , staff, hospitality one can vherish for ever whenever someone looks back. Ravinder Room Tip: Every place is different."
POSITIVE,"Weekend getaway, lots to do and great location. The hotel is very clean and was a good breakfast :) thanks!"
POSITIVE,"This was our third visit to this hotel and we look forward to each visit. We enjoy staying here as the rooms are bright and clean; the staff friendly and courteous and location perfect for our shopping needs. The breakfast offers a good selection of hot food (eggs, meat and potatoes) and is different each day. Breakfast also includes the following selections: cereals, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, canned peaches or applesauce, bagels, toast and muffins. Our favourite is Waffles that come with choices of syrup, strawberries, whip cream, etc. There is coffee, tea, orange and apple juice, as well as milk. The rooms are spacious, the beds are comfortable and made up daily. All requests are handled in a professional manner and needs looked after quickly. Each room has a TV, coffee machine, fridge and hair dryer. Room Tip: Rooms on north and south side are quiet."
POSITIVE,"Easy access to the train - lots of cool shops and dining options. Perhaps not as ""nice"" as other Chicago hotels, but at half the price it is VERY serviceable. Breakfast kind of lame...."
POSITIVE,"The beds are so comfortable and the Asst. Manager, Travis was so helpful and attentive. I had a wonderful experienced and loved the free wi fi. I've seen bad reviews but they must be doing improvements because I don't agree at all. I will be staying long term in a few weeks and will definatly choose this hotel. The convienent location makes it perfect for business trips. I recomend to anyone on a local trip. Liked: The Service, The Staff"
POSITIVE,The Plaza is convenient to the airport. It is no luxury hotel; but the staff is helpful and the beds are clean and comfortable. I needed the room for the time between a morning arrival and a very late-at-night departure; and I got good sleep here.
POSITIVE,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the hotel. It was convientely located to most of the attractions we wanted to visit while in Waco. The hotel was most comfortable!
POSITIVE,Maximum personnel each room is higher than the other hotel around there and also the price is reasonable. Don't have any indoor swimming pool.
POSITIVE,It was so nice to have a well rested night from being up all night with my sister during her childbirth.
POSITIVE,"We always stay here when we visit our daughter and family. The rooms are large and clean. The linens always smell fresh. There is a frig/microwave, as well as free bottled water. Lots of good lighting. There is a sink/mirror area in addition to the bathroom, which is always nice. The pool area is great! Only place we have seen with a big wading pool for little ones in addition to a huge regular pool and a hot tub as well. Our little grandkids are always welcome to come and swim when we stay here. We love the decor of the lobby - the waterfall and sweeping staircase are beautiful. The free, fresh cookies in the evening are a nice touch - as well as the free hot chocolate and coffee offered in the lobby. The people at the front desk are very nice and helpful. We highly recommend this hotel. Another plus is that it is across the street from Costco!"
POSITIVE,"Was looking for a room with a jetted tub for a relaxing get away, and the Best western was perfect! Our room was huge, the bed was comfortable, and the balcony overlooking the Columbia River couldn't be beaten! We got a great off season rate, the breakfast was full service in the restaurant and included ( not a buffet bar!).. We had a great time, Hood river is awesome, and so is this hotel!"
POSITIVE,"Location was great, staff was excellent, clean updated rooms. Only downside were the smokers next door whose smoke drifted to our patio and into the A/C vents. Not the place to stay if you want to be right in the town of Hood River - you'll need to drive."
NEGATIVE,Shuttle service was good. Free to and from airport and free to mid strip Lots
NEGATIVE,The hotel was totally overbooked for a church convention with many people to a room resulting in a car park that had no spaces for people wanting to leave and come back. Although we had two rooms in our party and one car we had to park away from the hotel. Breakfast was a disaster and totally out of control resulting in our eating away from the hotel as there was not enough food or drink for all the people. Pros: Nothing Cons: Over booked people that the hotel had not catered for. Location: Good
POSITIVE,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it's very, very comfortable! I don't think I have ever stayed at a hotel that has had these comfortable beds! The breakfast in the morning was AMAZING! It's not your normal continentalbreakfast. It has biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and more. I would stay at this hotel again for sure!"
NEGATIVE,"The rooms were very nice, good location, nice staff"
POSITIVE,"My sister and I visited Jacksonville for a football game at the Jaguars Stadium, and were looking for a convenient, reasonably-priced hotel. This was a last-minute trip, and I was anxious about the final decision. However, this Best Western was a great idea! In fact, we are looking to go back for another battle (maybe my team will win this time!), and will likely stay here again. The staff was pleasant, everything was very clean, free breakfast, and the drive to the stadium was less than 10 minutes. Even though we hung out at the Jacksonville Landing late on game night, it was still an easy drive back to the hotel. (I worried beforehand that this would be a burden.) Not to insult the BW, but I actually felt like we were at a more highly-regarded property (like a Marriott or Hilton). Thanks for surpassing our expectations!"
POSITIVE,"This place was great!! Everything was clean and the beds were incredibility comfortable, the staff was very friendly and helpful!! The breakfast was wonderful, with the waffle option AND French Toast, sausage, fabulous scrambled eggs, plus all the other usual breakfast options - cereal, yogurt, etc. Plus, there was a Denny's right across the street for an quick and easy dinner. If I find myself in that area again, I'd make sure this is where I'd stay!!"
NEGATIVE,"I'd say nothing with the exception of the price We stayed for 2 days, wi-fi was down for 1.5 with the staff being unable to give any guidance on when it'll be ok. The second morning it turned out that the door to the bathroom in our room somehow closed and we were unable to open it anyhow. It was early in the morning we visited the reception, they promised to manage it soon and then called back and said they'd only do something in two hours. The food at the restaurant was awful and without the internet we were unable to find any alternatives on the first day."
NEGATIVE,"I liked the room staff, the nearness to shopping, the price. The pool was not bad. I found the restaurant/cafe poor and the service minimal. I had a hot sandwich recommended as the chef's favorite, which was barely palatable and reminded me of the food in a 'greasy spoon' diner I once worked in as a boy. After that, I never set foot in the cafe again during my five-day stay. Although I reserved an airport shuttle 24 hours in advance, the driver never checked the reservation list and had to be called, presumably at home, by the front desk. He arrived half an hour late, but offered no apology or explanation."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable, nice staff, good breakfast. Rooms are spacy with everything you need, very clean. It is very quiet except when parents leave small kids playing and be very noisy in front of your door at 7:00am. Good location if you want to visit San Diego."
POSITIVE,"We arrived late on Christmas Day to a warm smile and a cheerful welcome. The young lady at the counter was so helpful in giving me directions to find a bottle of milk for an 18-month-old when all stores were closed. Later, when I discovered I had forgotten to pack my toiletries, she supplied me with the essentials and a generous ""Merry Christmas!"" The next morning, we checked out with Michele, who was a complete delight. Her cheerful conversation, assistance with breakfast, explanation of the billing, and general helpfulness were wonderful. We really enjoyed this stay!"
POSITIVE,"Great location. Walked to Times Square, subway, theaters and restaurants. This is a great hotel with two good restaurants next door. It is a perfect location for the theater and we walked to The Wicked, Chinglish and The Jersey Boys. The staff was helpful and always had a smile on their face. We were in room 329 and the only mark against them was the noise the pipes made when flushing the toilet. (Old pipes)."
POSITIVE,Very nice people at the front desk. Breakfast was very nice. Room was clean and nice towels. Bed covers and bed was to small.Pros: Location easy access. Cons: Bed too small.
POSITIVE,"We stopped here after a long days drive. It was an ok stop to sleep and shower. Beds were a bit soft even for me. Room was quiet and clean. Refrigerator in room but no micro-wave. Lobby area tastefully done in keeping with the surrounding area theme. Breakfast was adequate, not as good as some recent BWI's we have stayed. Small pool and spa. One of the better room rates I've experienced during this summer travels. ""Happy hour"" provided one free beer or wine. Cookies and milk in the evening. One lobby computer worked very well."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here on 11/19/11. Although it was a quick stay (just overnight, less than 12 hours) I had nothing but a positive experience. No issues with a late check-in (11:00pm), front desk staff extremely efficient and friendly. Room was average sized, clean, and comfortable. Bathroom was more spacious than I expected (although we did have a handicapped accessible room, so I'm not sure if that's why). I didn't partake in the complimentary breakfast so I can't speak to that. Right off the highway with plenty of eating options nearby. Definitely recommend."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel due to it was ""dog friendly"" They accept large dogs up to 80lbs. We have 2 German Shepherds. Front desk gave us ""doggie bags"" upon arrival with treats & supplies inside. Our room was large, clean, comfortable & easily accessible to the dog area. Added perks for this hotel has late check out, noon, and breakfast until 9:30. Breakfast [?] included waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, yogurt, coffee & juice. This hotel is close to restraunts, grocery stores & Starbucks. We will stay again at this hotel when traveling in this area with our dogs."
POSITIVE,"The owner and staff at this hotel did everything they could to ensure a great stay. I was in Iowa covering the Caucuses with 15 other news personnel. Everyone did their best to accommodate our unique needs and erratic schedule. Late night editing sessions were made less stressful with home-baked cookies and coffee. Every staffer went the extra mile to give us everything we needed! If you're looking for a place to stay near Des Moines, I would definitely recommend this Best Western in Clive!"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I stayed here in order to be close to the wildlife refuge, and we were very satisfied. I noticed when making a reservation that the ""poolside rooms"" cost $10 extra, and I reserved a non-poolside room. It appears that poolside rooms have a somewhat better view. All rooms face the same direction, but non-poolside rooms are directly across the street from McDonalds, while the non-poolside rooms are directly across from open marsh. I think it would have been worth the $10 to be on the poolside, but I'd rather have a 3rd floor non-poolside room (which we had), than a 1st floor poolside room. The extra touches I liked were chocolate chip cookies on check-in, a free USA Today delivered to the door, even on Saturday, and hot apple cider in the lobby. The room was perfect, with coffee maker, refrigerator, ironing board, and a vanity area separate from the bathroom. Room Tip: Poolside, 3rd floor See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,"Room was warm and had good heater Old, worn down, out dated, hallways dirty, icy walk ways to my room, had to ask to get shampoo, not enough cough in room, old stye T.v,"
NEGATIVE,"The staff was friendly. However, every time we needed something we had to wait several minutes, because no one was ever at the front desk. I do have to give the one of the staff members credit, because he was very helpful and prompt when I asked for something. The hotel condition wasn't the greatest. Several window screens were torn, the hot tub was broken, the bathroom near the pool was always dirty, and every business around the hotel had nicely manecured grounds except the hotel. The grass was dead and several feet tall. I was tempted to switch to the nearby competiting hotel across the parking lot and pay a little more. Unless they do a serious makeover, I will not recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Wow can you say super service, clean hotel ,all this and more with a view. From the moment we checked in friendly, professional staff and it was that way in the morning too. Breakfast was fine and there were 2 staff refilling, cleaning etc. This hotel is just off the trans canada but still relatively quiet. Pool was great too."
POSITIVE,"This is not the right place for anyone who demands a modern, pristine, cookie-cutter motel. It is a 40-year-old comically ludicrous, fake medieval mishmash, inspired either by DisneyLand or the movie Camelot. It sits, incongruously, in no land of scenic woods and pastures, but between a gas station and a McDonalds: immediately behind the property, a hillside is adorned with the monster tanks and cylinders of a spacious fuel depot. I stayed there only because it was one of the very few places in the area that would accept my big sloppy old dog. Within 15 minutes of arriving my inclination was to get away and find somewhere else, because it took me that long, even with the assistance of two very helpful staff members, to gain access to my room. The problem -- and apparently it is well known and acknowledged -- is that the magnetized ""keyless entry"" cards used at the Canterbury Inn are ultra-sensitive to contamination from skin contact. I eventually learned that one needs to wipe the magnetic strip on a cotton garment in order for it operate the door locks. My room, once I gained entry to it, was very odd indeed. Lots of dark wood, texture plastered walls, woodchip plaster ceiling, and 70's era electrics. I expected it to be dirty. But it wasn't. It must be a struggle, but somehow the management is contriving to keep this peculiar hotel clean and functioning properly. And the room proved to be very comfortable, with a good solid bed and excellent quality bedding and pillows; a decent armchair; a huge bookcase filled with nicely bound old volumes of Readers Digest condensed books; a big old tube TV that worked well enough; a fridge; a microwave; coffee maker; and a good desk and chair for internet service. Sound-proofing was reasonable too -- certainly better than in many more modern hotels -- even though my room was close to the pool area, which seemed to be hosting at least three childrens birthday parties on this weekend. Everything was 70's era, including the bathroom. But it was all very clean, and everything worked. Good maintenance. The internal layout of the Canterbury Inn is as perplexing as the entire concept. If entering via the lobby, in order to reach my room I had to walk (after many twists and turns) through the pool area. There are other, more direct external access doors: but they require you to master those quirky ""keyless entry"" cards. I would recommend this hotel for: [a] those with a high patience threshold; [b] anyone seeking a little variety from a cookie-cutter motel; [c] probably especially for couples interested in a fantasy-romance getaway. Room Tip: There are no standardized rooms here. Every room has its unique properties. Discuss your preferenc..."
POSITIVE,"Great staff and a nice hotel but in a BAD neighbourhood Apparently we were not the only ones that thought the hotel had a pool. Front desk told us many people think there is a pool at the hotel, as I did but it is just a patio area with a pond. A full picture of the pool area would be better than a thumnail picture from door. Without a pool or hot tub, [?] there is not much to do. Bad neighbourhood to walk around in."
POSITIVE,The most amazing bed I have slept on in a motel ever..I even asked the front desk how to get some of their wonderful pillows! The entire staff made us feel like part of their family. There are not enough nice things to say! We will stop here everytime we drive through Grants Pass!
POSITIVE,Very nice hotel. No problems encountered. The building and the rooms look clean and well kept. Continental breakfast very decent.
POSITIVE,Very nice clean hotel. Staff was pleasant and professional. Nice hot complimentary breakfast. Great location in vicinity of many restaurants and close to freeway.
POSITIVE,"First time my husband and I have ever had a vacation without our kids. This was our 17 th wedding anniversary and decided it's about time! We couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel. The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly. The breakfast was so so, about what you would expect. I would definitely stay again. Pros: The location, staff and comfort. Cons: Breakfast and it was hard to sleep in because it is a bit noisey in the morning. Location: It was literally minutes from all attractions!"
POSITIVE,"Location, ammenities and cleanliness are my top priorities and this one has it all. Located on Rt. 41 across from the mall and walking distance to pulbix yet on the edge of a residential area making it a nice bike ride, walk or drive to the Gulf and Venetian Bay where you can find shops, water front restaurants and boat rentals. Even at Christmas the roads and area was not crowded. I stayed in the king bedroom suite with a full kitchen, room 458 has a great view of the pool. The furniture was comfortable, modern and functional with a well equipped full kitchen. I liked the fact they supplied wine glasses, a good quality wine opener and full size coffee maker. The bed was good quality and the rooms spacious with 2 sliding glass doors to the balcony which was screened.... a nice feature allowing me to sleep with the glass doors open. The 50 inch flat screen tv in the living room was made even better by the motel's extensive dvd library which was free to guests The grounds were spectacular. Waterfalls abounded in the pool area. Beautiful metal sculptures added to the ambience. The sand sculptures at the front of the hotel had people stopping for pictures. The pools (2) were warm with plenty of chairs and I loved the hot tubs not always found in motels in Florida. The deluxe continental breakfast was served pool side which was quite nice and all staff friendly and helpful. There restaurant suggestions were right on. Tin City has great seafood restaurants and a short 10 min. drive. I considered a full size condo in Bonita Springs but stayed with Best Western Naples and I'm glad I did. If I vacation in south west Florida again, I will stay in Naples and stay at the Best Western. Room Tip: If you stay in a one or two bedroom suite, ask for a view of the pool. Not too many of the bedroom suites have a nice view."
POSITIVE,"Pleasant stay. Room was clean but an overall dated feel to hotel leaves a lacking feeling. Customer service at front desk was awesome. View from room was pretty good (10th floor) despite the foggy conditions. Walls between room allow a pretty considerable amount of noise through though not too much of a problem. I will be staying here again, especially when discount through the site applies!"
POSITIVE,"Clean, reasonably quiet, and a good breakfast. All you really want when you are on the road. The staff was friendly and it meets all reasonable expectations. My only complaint were the flourescent lights which were a bit stark. However, that is a minor quibble. Room Tip: The main building is a bit further from the highway and probably quieter"
POSITIVE,The location is great...only a couple blocks from the bell centre and one block from st Catherine's st. The rooms are small but not so small where you can't move. I had breakfast at Cora's and it was yummy!
POSITIVE,"We are regular customers of BW in Gettysburg, PA, and felt the quality we have come to expect there would be replicated at the Austin facility. And it was. We also chose BW for its proximity to the airport in order to not have volumes of traffic to deal with in the morning. Would have liked a bar where we could have enjoyed a mixed drink the evening we checked in."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I both have back issues.. the bed in this room was amazing.. wish we knew what brand mattress.. we would buy one.. Very clean.. even corners in the bathroom were clean.. I have stayed at a lot of motels through the years and this was by far the best and the most reasonably priced. Noise was not an issue, we didn't even hear cars that pulled in late. Very friendly staff we will definitely stayhere when passing through again.. Room Tip: I asked for a room with a comfortable bed.. I got great!!! See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,"Standard hotel room nothing special about it but the bed was very comfortable. Was a little far out of the city and the traffic heading into downtown was horrible. Took a short taxi ride, for about 10 bucks and took the CTA train into the city. We definitely had to go through an area that was a little shady to get into the city. If you want to visitÂ downtown, either travel during daylight hours...if you decide to take the train or find a hotel a little closer."
POSITIVE,"I stayed overnight at this hotel. It was clean, safe and moderately priced for this area. I was very impressed by the service. It is sometimes difficult to find courteous people who care about their jobs in Miami and the young lady behind the front desk was more than helpful and courteous. She should be commended for her excellent customer service. It made the stay very nice. There is also a good breakfast in the morning. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone visiting the area."
POSITIVE,"I will rate this hotel by giving you the good points and then the bad ( the bad are minor things). good: five minute walk and you are inside disneyland. There are a variety of food choices that are a one to two minute walk away. There is a denny's , Ihop, tony romas and cold stone and each would take you a two minute walk time at the most. There are other food options that are just a short walk away like mcdonolds and mimis. The only one we ate at is the cold stone since we could not resist it walking back to our room at midnight. The hotel staff is very nice. We arrived at 9:00 a.m and they did not have our room ready for us but I was not expecting it since check in time is 3:00pm but they did allow me to park my car there for the day and they do not charge for parking like the Best Western Park Place Inn does which is a few hotels down from this one. When we returned at 3:00 pm our room was ready and it was on the top floor as we requested. At check in they gave me a coupon for a free kids meal at the Rainforest cafe and I had made the comment "" ill take all the coupons I can get"" so the front dest person ( dont have her name ) handed me coupons for bubba gump shrimp , and tony romas and told me if I were to show my room key to Denny's they would also give me a discount. There is a nice sized fridge that kept our bottled waters very cold. There was a microwave and coffee maker that I did not use. The hairdryer worked great. The room was clean when we walked in. The night before we checked in we had stayed one night at the Motel 6 on disney way and I woke up with the worst back pain ever. The beds here were much better and comfortable. There was a brand new shower head in the shower and the shower was shiney clean. Other than the noisy maid carts that I will mention in the bad part of this review, I did not hear any noise from neighboring rooms and did not hear any traffic noise. We had a room towards the very end of the place and I think that made all the difference for us. Now I will go over things I did not like which are minor things and things that I could live with but the purpose of writing a review on a hotel room is to inform others of things that might make there decision on their hotel since your hotel stay can make or break your vacation. When we walked in to the room at 3:00 pm it was very hot and the air conditioner unit is very small and in a corner behind a cabinet. It took a while to cool off the room . I didnt think it would cool it off at all but when we returned later that night at midnight it had cooled the room . The room is on the smaller side. It was just me and my 11 year old so it was perfect for us . There is no room for any kind of playpen for a baby or an air mattress if you were trying to fit a larger family in the room. The bathroom was very small as well but it worked for the shower or that main purpose you use the restroom for but again, If you were trying to bath small children in there ( just thinking back to when mine was a little one and sitting next to the tub bathing them) it wouldnt have been easy. The wallpaper in the bathroom looked a little outdated and patched together. My main complaint about this hotel is the noise you here from the maids pushing their carts in the early mornings . The walkway is bumpy and everytime they would push their carts by my daughter thought there was an earthquake and it was noisy. We did not use the pool so I cant comment a lot about it but one afternoon there was about five kids in it and it seemed too crowded ; its a smaller pool. there is no type of breakfast offered like some of the other resorts which might have been nice and budget friendly. For me , the good things about this hotel out wayed the bad. I will stress again, the things that I have mention on the bad side were not all that bad for me. The room was clean and comfortable and we did not stay in the room too long in the mornings for the noisy maid carts to really bother us and we didnt need a lot of space since it was just the two of us. I would definatley stay here again."
NEGATIVE,"When I arrived the hotel looked like what I expected however things soon changed. The Primrose is part of a student housing program so there are students all over the place. Unfortunately a lot of them do not know how to respect the comfort of others. Doors slamming, talking loudly in passageways and TVs/Music on loud. Each time I went in or out it took a long time to get an elevator because of the number of students wanting to use it. On one night it took a trip to reception and two phone calls for the manager to do something about the noise. It was the Saturday night before Hallowen and there were a lot of parties in rooms and students roaming around. The manager appologised and stated the problem was because of Halloween. Admittedly the noise did reduce that night however on other nights loud voices and slamming doors kept me awake. The bar and restaurant were not open at night so I had to find alternatives. The diner next door was a good alternative. Under normal circumstances the hotel would be acceptable however if they continue with housing students I would stay well away and find somewhere quieter."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at the Primrose hotel a few times. I continue to go back because the room is clean, beds are comfortable, location and the rooms are sufficient size. It is also good bang for your buck. The location is not too bad, walking distance to downtown and very close to Maple Leaf Gardens, which recently opened as a grocery store/ market, which is fantastic, a must see. The staff is really good at this hotel anytime there is a problem they are there immediately to fix it. The hotel is a little tired and so are the rooms but the beds are comfortable and rooms are clean. Nothing fancy, but I do like duvets which they have. I have stayed at many hotels over the years and if the staff and beds are good, I'm happy. The one thing I learned on the last trip is some of the floors are temporary dorms for University student. So don't be surprised if you see a lot of university aged people. It did not cause any problems for us, including no problem with noise. Room Tip: The rooms I have stayed in are all good."
POSITIVE,Hotel staff were very friendly and accomadating. Vicky at the front desk was very nice and made us feel welcome. The hotel is situated in a good area and walking distance to Eaton Centre and many other attractions. We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk. We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around. Over all our hotel was clean and we had a newly renovated room. I would stay here again! Room Tip: Ask for a higher floor with newly renovated rooms.
POSITIVE,"I have to say that I was so surprised with this property. The staff was very friendly. Great breakfast in the mornings, free internet. The hot tub and heated pool was just what I needed. I also was pleased with how clean the hotel and rooms were. I am looking forward to visiting there again."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night in late spring. The hotel seemed average, meaning, it had hot water, an ok bed, and no visible damage or stains. But, for whatever reason, it attracted a rowdy crowd of drunk senior citizens. We went to bed late, but it turns out the senior citizens go to bed even later. There was lot running and shouting in the hallway that night and the hotel staff did not seem to care. The hotel's continental breakfast was neither continental nor breakfast. The coffee was an insult to coffee. This hotel is fine when you are in a pinch, but it is certainly the kind of place where you want to pull off the comforter and make sure it doesn't touch any of your belongings. Room Tip: The front of the hotel faces a highway. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back. And..."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here because it looked like one of the nicest Best Western's on the OR coast, with an indoor pool! Our kids talked about the pools for days before we left, got there right at check in so we could spend a couple hours swimming....got to the pool, and it was freezing! It was 74 degrees in the pool room and the water was even colder. We tried ""getting used to it"", but kids ended up crying and screaming it was too cold. Ended up going back to the room with crying kids! We were very disappointed, since that was the reason we stayed there :( Room Tip: Partial ocean view turned out to be a pretty good view, with a balcony! But the room, and especailly bathroom were on the small side. Hallway leading to pools, and other halls, are exposed to outside air, so can be cold hallways."
POSITIVE,"Room was very clean, attractive, comfortable and quiet. The kitchenette was stocked with bowls, plates, utensiles, drinking glasses, mugs, pots & pans, cutting board and toaster. Also stove top, microwave oven and small refrigerator. Made it easy to fix our own meals. Easy walking distance to shopping, restaurants and fun stuff to do. The promenade and beach was right outside our balcony. Great view from our patio. Will definitely be staying here again. Did not try the fitness room, pool and hot tub but they looked very nice."
POSITIVE,"We had a great time at this hotel. An Oceanfront resort - our room on the top floor had an incredible view. Location could not be better with the beach at your front door, plus dining and tourist attractions within easy walking distance. Evening sunsets were superb. Dinner at the on site Italian Restaurant was very good. The hotel staff from the front desk to the restaurant were very gracious and helpful. A very good value. We will definitely return. Room Tip: ""Select a top floor room for the best view."
NEGATIVE,"I'm surprised this hotel had the TripAdvisor reviews it did. The horrible man at the front desk did not honor our reservation for two beds, because there was an ""inspection"" the next day. I had a horrible migraine, so I just agreed to it, and asked for a discount - he gave us $10 off or something like that. I then asked for some recommendations on how to get to manhattan the next day. He was very dismissive and obviously didn't want to help. I then tried the keys, which didn't work. My boyfriend walked back to the office and got new keys. They didn't work either. The man then implied to my boyfriend that he was using the key wrong. Another employee came with him and verified that there was something wrong with the key system. that night someone rented the room above us, and it sounded like a 1,000 pound person with each step. also, there were flies in our room. Internet didn't work and breakfast was definitely continental - the only thing palatable was cheeerios. anything positive? shower was good, and they brought us blankets when we asked. we took the ferry from Weehawken to Manhattan the next day, so I recommend finding a hotel near there...."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel's daily rates really vary depending on the rate you get quoted when calling the hotel & what you can find on line - so definitely do some investigation work/inquiries before you book... I needed a room last minute on a Friday evening (around 6pm), so I called the hotel personally, and was quoted a rate of $250. I decided to give it another chance & later looked/booked on line for $179 & when I checked in (around 7:30pm), was told I got the very last room they had. Seems better business sense to just book the last room for something, rather then risk losing a saleâ¦ But I guess someone else would have came along & paid the $250 around 8pm!. Also just FYI - the taxes are average $25 per night, they also charge you tourism tax (what ever that is) per day which also varies in price daily (around $2.75), an energy fee per night of $5.00, and parking which is $15 per day. And the final disclosure - they charge $75 per day for pets. So just so you know/factor in the added expenses, when staying at this particular Best Western (privately owned with 86 rooms), that along with the sliding differential daily room rate, expect to pay the extras listed above (average $48 per day) & ($123 with a pet per day). So in my opinion/in the end, you can probably stay somewhere more conducive and personable for the added multifarious fees. Room Tip: Just shop around."
POSITIVE,"We needed a place to stay for the weekend while we were down for the UGA/FL football game. We wanted a place that kept us out of all the traffic of downtown Jacksonville, but close enough so the drive back and forth was not too bad. This was the perfect location... it was a straight shot to the downtown area and it only took about 10 minutes to get [?] there - once back, there were several restaurants and plenty of entertainment within 5 minutes. The hotel was clean, the room was nicely furnished and I felt safe and clean the entire time. Plus the price was right... will definitely stay again next year!"
NEGATIVE,"Stayed here for one night on a Thursday. Arrived after dark in a rain storm, so no first impression of the exterior. However, future guest please note the Heimos Industrial Park Drive is an outer road just past the highway access ramps, don't pass it like I did. There were two other customers at the desk when I arrived, but check in went relatively quickly. On to my room on the 3rd level. I found the steps to be more convenient than the elevator. The end of the 3rd floor hall was being used as a storage area with bed frames, mattresses, cases of breakfast items, etc stacked and leaning against the walls - seemed sort of trashy. My room was a nice size, older furniture and fixtures, but all in good repair and clean. The TV had a wide variety of stations. The table that served as a workspace was small and didn't allow me to spread out my documents and use my computer. The room was very quiet, I did not experience any noise from the highway even though my room was at that end of the building and I had my window cracked open. The heater worked quietly and effectively, but left the bathroom cool. The bed was comfortable, linens clean, several different types of pillows to choose from. The floor under the carpet seem lumpy...maybe old broken down carpet pad? I arose Friday morning shortly before 7 to take a shower, the water was barely warm. I called down to the desk and was told to wait a few minutes. I tried the water every 10 minutes and it continued to become colder, so I couldn't even take a quick sponge bath. I finally opted to change my morning plans and waited for hot water. Finally shortly after 8 I had lots of scalding hot water. Because my plans were flexible, I was able to wait out the water, but this could have changed my stay from poor to unacceptable. When I went to a late breakfast, I found the over-sized eating area full of other guests, but there was plenty of food, both in quantity and variety. As a final note, the hotel was not at capacity the evening I stayed."
POSITIVE,"The staff of this hotel is friendly and good humored. Having to travel alone sometimes, I feel safe here. The location is ideal for shopping, dining out, and going into the city."
POSITIVE,Very clean & comfortable.
POSITIVE,Very nice and comfortable stay we were very delighted with our choice great stay more like a 3+ star not 2.5 Thanks Priceline big fans.Pros: Clean Clean Clean nice room nice location great staff good breakfast. Cons: Does not apply.
NEGATIVE,"Our recent stay at Best Western, Smyrna, DE was disappointing. Although the rooms were clean the advertised Free WiFi was NOT. When we arrived we tried logging on to the Best Western web site from the lobby to make our reservations and could not get out on to the internet...on two different laptops. We asked the desk clerk and she simply told us the web site to go to to make the reservations. Another desk person arrived and he was also not helpful with the internet or rather LACK of internet. We spent the night and were not able to get out on the Free WiFi, we even went to the Business Center and also could not get on the internet from there. After several attempts to ask the folks behind the desk to help out, we gave up. Will never stay there again..."
POSITIVE,"Pool, hot tub for the kids. Fridge & microwave in room The hard boiled eggs in the am. Kind of rubbery. Great - Mall next door, close to UConn and resturants. The staff at the hotel is very friendly. Our Bldg was under renovation, but we didn't consider it at problem. The hard boiled eggs in the morning are gross...so I don't eat them. We have no complaints about this hotel. We have stayed here many times and we will continue to return anytime we are in CT and will return. The kids love the ppol & hot tub."
POSITIVE,The staff was very helpful and polite. The hotel was very clean and neat and the housekeeping staff did a nice job! I would definately stay here again!
POSITIVE,"Desk staff very friendly and helpful Older hotel that has been well taken care of and updated. Cleanliness of room was good. You can tell the staff really cleans. Corners, behind chair, under suitcase rack all were clean and vacuumed/swept. I really like being able to park next to the door. Makes loading and unloading so much easier and trips backÂ for something you forgot so much quicker."
POSITIVE,The hotel was very clean and the staff was great and so helpful.Pros: The room was very clean. Cons: The carpet had a smell.
POSITIVE,"This was a very nice hotel - recently completely renovated. The room was very clean and the staff was nice and friendly. The continental breakfast was a welcome surprise! I would recommend this hotel to people staying in Pittsfield.Pros: New, clean, friendly staff and great continental breakfast."
POSITIVE,"This is one of the best values on the beach. We have stayed at several other hotels and this one is clean, no musty smell like some have, the rooms are decorated nicely, beds are comfortable. They upgraded us from Oceanview to Ocean front without us even asking so very nice surprise and beautiful view. My one complaint was the lights above the vanity are very dark and it is hard to see to apply makeup - at least in the room we stayed."
POSITIVE,The beds were the best we have ever found at any hotel. The free breakfast was exceptional and the staff was very friendly. We had a great time.
POSITIVE,"We chose the Harbor Yacht Inn, based on a previous visit which was most enjoyable. This visit lived up to our previous expectations of being very comfortable and enjoyable.The inclusion of free breakfast tickets at the Bon Appetit Cafe, was an exceptionally special treat.Their breakfast choices were scrumptous, and the service was always pleasant."
POSITIVE,"Drove to the grand canyon with my sister, spent sometime in flagstaf, drove back down through oak creek canyon, stayed over night in cottonwood . next day went up to jarome,and then we went to montazuma's castle, Great area and motel to stay over night! Made our trip just right. Will stay here again. Robert"
POSITIVE,"Modest, clean accommodations. Good price for the area."
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay in Napa county. I was a little skeptical seeing that it was a Best Western, but Stevenson Manor was a great place to stay. The staff were very courteous and helpful, and there was a great complimentary breakfast in the morning. There is also a cute courtyard area that we didn't use but looked nice for relaxing and hanging out. The price was really decent as well for the area. It's not the most ritzy place you could stay in Napa county, but the room was spacious and clean. There was a small kitchen sink, microwave, and refrigerator in the room in the corner, very handy. They also have complimentary wireless. The location is great: straightforward to get on 128 to get down to St. Helena and Napa. The Silverado Trail is easy access from there as well if you want a more scenic route. There are plenty of spas and shopping nearby if you're looking to just hang out in Calistoga. Again, if you're looking for plush and fancy, Stevenson Manor may not suit you, but if you're looking for a clean, comfy, and friendly base for your Napa county travels, I would definitely recommend staying here."
NEGATIVE,Checked into this hotel on March 16th for a St Pattys day weekend in Boston. When we checked in we were told that a bus tour had just arrived and the hotel was sold out. Our room we booked (2 doubles and a pull out) was no longer available. We were given 1 King bed with a pull out. No explanation really other than the hotel was sold out and this was all we could get. We had 4 people in our room and the pull outs are only a single. 3 of us had to share a king bed all weekend to save sleeping on the floor. The rooms were ok - clean but basic. Local isn't bad either - close to Fenway and all the local bars and shopping. I probably wouldn't stay here again given what had happened.
POSITIVE,very nice and the employees were very polite and helpful
NEGATIVE,"Pros: Breakfast in the morning and the shuttle service to the game, restaurants very close. Cons: Not clean overall."
POSITIVE,"The bed, comforter is not appealing/appeasing. Consider replacing them. The breakfast (cafeteria) - sitting arrangement should be improved. The variety of food items should be augmented. No kitchen staff is found to talk to - if one need to ask for any clarification/assistance. Front desk staff is very friendly and helpful.Pros: Very good spacious rooms, with large size mirror, a good table/chair and fast Internet connection. Cons: I did not like the comforter (and other bed sheets). The comforter should be replaced - make it more appealing."
NEUTRAL,"Everything was fine...no surprises here. Nothing fancy, but fine for business."
POSITIVE,Great price
POSITIVE,"We checked in late at night (had a reservation) and the only room left was on the 3rd floor. I had not told them that my daughter (10 years old) had broken her ankle the week before and was in a boot. They were so nice but didn't have any other rooms left. There was no elevator. I said not a problem, we're going up once and down once and we'll be just fine. So we finished checking in and the manager (owner?) comes running out of the front door and says that he will carry her up the stairs! I of course declined, but was really touched by their offer. The room was sparkling clean and we had a great stay. And it turns out that the 3rd floor was only the 2nd floor from the back of the hotel (built into a hill) so and easy single flight of stairs. OH! And we looked tired (we'd been sightseeing all day) and they gave us snacks while we were checking in! Would recommend to anyone!"
NEGATIVE,"I attempted to make a reservation 4 days before my need. I work nights as a nurse and needed a room for day sleeping. I was denied a reservation because they wanted to save the rooms for travellers that MIGHT be stranded in a snow storm that MAY be coming their way. What happened to first come, first served? A little denial goes a long way - friends, family and co-workers are aware of my dilemma. Best Western management stood behind their choice. Best Western is now Worst Western in my opinion."
NEUTRAL,"Tons of Kids running down the halls & splashing in the hot tub. The hot tub was VERY small, and could only hold about 8 people comfortably. Note that children splash in the hot tub & take up all the space. The pool was actually small because the workers block off 1/2 of it for one waterslide. The waterslide was very basic and not many people enjoyed it. The rooms were basic, could use some renovation. Room Tip: Choose a room AWAY from the pool so you don't have to hear screaming & that way your hotel room isn't humid."
POSITIVE,"This is a good choice if you're looking for an inexpensive but decent place in Palm Desert for a few nights. The location is convenient and the free cooked breakfast is a real plus. It's not really a ""resort"" type facility but neither is the price."
NEUTRAL,Stayed for a week and felt the hotel room was very much lacking. The exterior will fool you because it is nice to look at. The room themselves are in need of a much overdo makeover. When a room is so outdated there is not much the staff can do to make up for the negative feelings. Maid service was more then adequate and the breakfast was excellent.
POSITIVE,"Overall, I enjoyed staying at this Best Western hotel. But, on the second night of my stay, a towel fire occured in the laundry room at around midnight and prompted a loud, annoying, fire alarm for at least 30 minutes until the fire department arrived. The next day there was no hot water. The manager was very nice and gave everyone who complained aÂ 25% discount on there next stay at the hotel."
POSITIVE,"After reading some negative reviews, I was not sure about this hotel. However, after booking and staying for five days on a recent business trip, I was pleasantly surprised! This is not a five-star hotel, nor did I expect it to be. My room was clean and comfortable. On the website it said there was high speed internet in public areas. That was not accurate, as I had high speed internet in my room. I used the shuttle everyday, and it was convenient and timely. An added plus is you can take either the Best Western or Holiday Inn Dulles shuttles to the Best Western, as they are jointly owned. The front desk personnel were great, and worked hard to insure you had a good stay at the hotel. The breakfast served daily was pretty basic, with a couple of hot items as well as cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit. My greatest concern when booking was the fact that entry into the rooms is from the outside. That concern quickly faded as this hotel is located in a quiet, safe area. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It was a great value! Room Tip: The Best Western is located next to the Holiday Inn Dulles. O'Malley's Pub is just a short walk across the street and a great place to have lunch or dinner."
NEUTRAL,"The room was clean, fluffy towels, BUT when I asked for an extra bath towel and wash cloth it was a BIG DEAL!! The snotty maid said their was only two people in our room and if I wanted another towel it had to be approved by the manager!!! I finally was able to get two towels after I signed for them at the front desk! For these reasons I will never stay again. I felt like a criminal. Also upon check out the front desk clerk said ""Hope you don""t want a receipt because I can't give you one"". Not a pleasant person! It was a strange stay and I will pay a little extra for a better experience."
POSITIVE,"very nice, attractive grounds -clean and comfortable rooms in a nice location Heating system made noise , but no place is perfect Pros: landscaping, location, comfort of rooms -interesting historical pictures on wall Cons: noisey heater Location: accessible from vienna and fairfax on chain bridge road"
POSITIVE,over all nice place to stay
POSITIVE,"Pleasantly surprised! Exceptionally clean and spacious suite for an amazing ""storm watchers"" price. Quiet room. Fair location... we could see the ocean through the telephone wires. Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. We will stay here again."
NEUTRAL,"The room is nice and clean. Breakfast was ok. But nice parking space, walk distance to harbor. We did not get a room facing the harbor, but what is the matter, San Diego has a lot more to see. The internet is really bad. Too slow, hard to get to, and disconnect all the time. I happened to have need to use internet to keep contact with work, but did take a lot of time to reconnect to the net. TV is still the old one, and not much channel, but again, who will watch TV in San Diego?"
POSITIVE,"Our puggle pup was welcomed at this Best Western Inn. First floor room, close to an outside door and she was all set to enjoy our stay. Thanks!"
POSITIVE,The service provided was nice.
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. Close enough to walk to alot of must see sights. My only complaint was that for the cost of the room, breakfast should have been included."
POSITIVE,"I spend about 70 nights a year in hotels and motels throughout the country. This property was among the best I have visited this year, and that includes the brands that charge $150 to $250 a night. Spacious, clean, bright, and everything worked. Staff was friendly, helpful, and service oriented. Breakfast was fine. Sure, there are always things you can find fault with (only the towels and an uncomforable sofa), but, hey, I have those kinds of problems at home. I was happy to see that there were serious efforts to remodel, refurbish, and repair during our off-season visit, because that shows management is getting ready for the busy season and is interested in reinvesting in their property. This is how to operate a property for the long haul."
POSITIVE,It was conveniently located. We walked to the Guthrie Theater and it was a pleasant walk. Also the price was right. The room was large and comfortable.
POSITIVE,"I first spoke with Patty who was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and then later I spoke with both Phil and Brett and they too made things easy for me and my situation of having to park my car and leave it there while I drove with friends to Las Vegas. They made the whole experience one of ease and no hassle. If they do that for someone who doesn't stay there, I know they must be twice as incredible for their guests!"
POSITIVE,Pros: Very comfortable bed. Cons: Carpets in room and hallway seemed dirty and elevator was not working when we arrived.
NEUTRAL,"I had problems with internet connection one evening and after calling the desk 3 times, they asked me to bring my computer down and said there was no problem with the connection but when I went back to my room, it wouldn't work there. So I had to call the desk again at which time they gave me an IT number and they corrected the problem but I had no internet connection for the rest of the evening which was really inconvenient.I also did find that the water pressure in the bathtub was really slow and took forever to fill the tub but the room was nice and clean otherwise.Pool very small and a little too cold. Felt kind of like being in a dungeon because it was in the basement with no windows or sunlight.Food very expensive though. Pie and coffee was over $7 and the pie was the frozen instant kind you purchase at the grocery store. Not freshly made.Felt that the staff could have been better informed at the desk in regards to the internet connections or lack thereof. Cons: No internet connection for 1 out of 4 evenings when I actually was at the hotel. Location: Location was easy enough to find and enough parking."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is a very nice addition to the range of newer hotels in the B/CS area. The room is nicely appointed, spacious, and clean. We stayed in a slightly larger ""suite"" that included a fold-out couch, which was nice as we were traveling with the kids. The breakfast was your typical higher-end ""breakfast-included"" fare. If you want to order off a menu, the IHOP next door offers a nice discount for hotel guests. The property is really not close to anything except a Target and movie theater. However, everything is relatively close in B/CS. You can get to Texas A&M in about 10 minutes. One downside was the hallway noise. The floors seemed ""hollow"" (for lack of a better term) and you can really hear people walking downs the hallways."
NEUTRAL,"Spent one night at the Best Western Plus Westwood Inn in Edmonton this month. Although the room was clean in was in need of some minor repairs and renoâs, there was a sign up saying that the hotel was under renovations so I am sure they will be getting to that room soon. It was a spacious room that had a work desk, free WIFI available, tv (which did not work well) fridge and a nice jetted tub in the bathroom. I noticed there was an indoor pool but we did not use it, I am not sure if there was a hot tub. There is a restaurant on site but never used that either. This hotel is very close to West Edmonton Mall."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was very nice, Lobby and rooms were very nice. Hotel staff were good. Needed axtra sheets and they were delivered within minutes. Breakfast was pricey (%20 hotel guest discount only just about covers taxes for our party of 6). Only complaint about the room - we found spoiled leftover food in the fridge left by the previous guests. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"My husband ,myself and sister stayed here for one night and found it great. The front desk clerk was friendly, the rooms clean and the bathroom(which I am very fussy about) super clean with lots of towels etc. The only complaint I have was the breakfast. Everything that was to be hot was cold. There was lots food but it was cold . If staying in that area I would say you really have to eat at Bumpers. We would stay here again if we were in the area.."
POSITIVE,I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and clean this hotel was.
POSITIVE,"Came to SD for a quickly planned college visit with my wife and two teenage boys. This hotel perfectly fit our requirements. Clean,safe, location, and cost. Staff was very friendly and professional. They have a standard continental breakfast, but the attention the staff devoted to keeping food stocked, coffee brewed, etc was noteworthy. There was enough space for us in the room and everything was well cleaned. Hopefully we'll be coming back to this city many times in the future...if so, this will be on our short list for dependable and affordable hotels."
NEUTRAL,"Clean, nice staff but has sincere maintenance issues including room key locks!"
POSITIVE,Heated pool No frig or microwave in room
NEGATIVE,It is not cleaned Out side it looks good but when you go in It is pretty bad
NEUTRAL,"Good - very excited with the hotel as a whole.Bad - during the night the heating unit started to malfunction. No heat, just a repeating cycle of the unit coming on for about 10 seconds, then turning off and coming back on again for another 10 seconds every 15 minutes. We stayed warm under the covers but took a real quick morning shower in a cold room. Only comment from management was that we should have called them. And what, get up in the middle of the nightand change rooms? We just left as soon as we could get ready to go."
POSITIVE,"Right on a pristine, miles long white sand beach! Free breakfast included, spacious rooms (get an oceanfront, beautiful. Sunrise and sunset views). Friendly staff and hotel is a 10 minute drive from shopping and a multitude of restaurants in Destin. You can't go wrong with this hotel and beach!"
POSITIVE,"This is a good place to stay with kids - pool and decent continental breakfast (waffle maker, egg and sausage sandwiches - we were expecting just cold cereal.) There is no elevator so be prepared to lug your bags up the stairs and we asked for a cot for my 8 year old, but they dont have cots...strange, a hotel with no cots! Nothing around to get a late [?] dinner, had to head to Littleton, approximately 15 minutes away to get pizza with kids."
POSITIVE,"The check in couldn't have been easier! Nice room, fast internet and breakfast to boot. I was a little worried when I realized a high school team of boys was at the end of my hall too near my room, but we never heard a peep. We were there 4 nights for a conference five miles away, and it was a very nice place to ""come home"" to at the end of each day. Pros: Free breakfast"
POSITIVE,"The room was good enough. Service was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was more substantial than I expected: eggs, sausage, toast, cereal, juice, coffee which did actually taste like coffee, although not strongly. The best thing was that it was VERY QUIET. In hotels, I am used to hearing (loudly) the folks next door and those above. Sometimes it seems like they're practicing their gymnastic floor routines on top of my ceiling. This hotel was a welcome contrast to the usual. I would gladly stay there again just for the quiet."
POSITIVE,"The well-appointed room was large, quiet and had small patio overlooking the courtyard. The beds were very comfortable, with a sufficient number of pillows. The bathroom was also very nice and had a large soaker tub. I was impressed to see recycling bins in the rooms. Much more like a Hyatt or a Marriott than a Best Western. Free breakfast is included - not gourmet (microwaveable omelettes), but varied enough to please most people. Fitness room was a little small. Apart from having some trouble with the A/C (room was too cold), I loved this hotel. Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the courtyard."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions and have always been satisfied with the room and service. Since I was here last year they have changed the breakfast from the typical continental breakfast in a breakfast room to serving a full breakfast buffet in the restaurant including an omelet bar, bacon, sausages etc. I used to stay here because it was a short walk to our office and OK, but a nice breakfast makes a big difference."
POSITIVE,"We stopped at BWP while traveling on vacation, what an unexpected surprise! We had no reservation but the Staff was so friendly and got us checked in in a matter of minutes. We were told about the Social hour with the arrangement of snacks that would be available, which was perfect since we had been traveling all day. The room was so clean and comfortable that nothing disturbed our sleep! Breakfast was such an unexpected surprise. We have stayed at many different Hotels and this by far was the most complete breakfast you could get without going to an actual restaurant! Every Staff member we ran into was very pleasant and friendly and had so many suggestions for us as far as places to visit and eat. We will definately recommend BWP and will be staying with them for all our future travel needs. Thank You Room Tip: Very nice Fitness Center and Pool and game room See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"My wife of 45 years and I stayed overnight here and had a wonderful experience. The staff was curteous and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. We were most impressed by the breakfast setting with lots of choices, including several coffee flavors, and good stuff to eat. Peggy, the hostess, is to be commended for her people skills as she made sure that everybody started their day with a good breakfast. She made us feel relaxed and showed genuine interest in our welfare. She earned our generous tip."

NEGATIVE,"Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Horrible area. Did not feel safe parking my car at all because of the area we were in. No attractions by the hotels, luckily we were not there for vacation. There were police pulling people over and arresting them several times in front and in back of the hotel. There is another hotel the Howard Johnson with a bar in back of the hotel, where people where yelling and loud throughout the night. The rooms were nice however, up to date. Breakfast was another terrible thing about it. It was horrible, have been to several hotels before and this by far lacks value. The staff were not very comforting, or reassuring was told to just park in the Howard Johnson, if I didn't want to park my vehicle in their lot. I will say though the rooms were nice, up to date and clean. Overall lousy 2 days stay. Thanks. Room Tip: Do not rent on the back side of hotel. Noisy with bar behind it!"
POSITIVE,"I needed a place to stay close to a meeting site, and this hotel was close to where I needed to be. The room was quite nice, comfortable, and clean. I only spent one evening, but it was quiet, and the beds were very comfortable. the surrounding neighborhood is typical of any downtown area. I didn't plan on walking around anyway. The hotel offered shelteredÂ parking with video surveillance which was desireable."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is located off the freeway exit. It's convenient other than when you are heading to it from the ASU Campus, you have to drive by it, make a U-turn and come back. No big deal though. Could use a good cleaning. There was hair all over our floors. The breakfast was great and the coffee was outstanding."
POSITIVE,"We stayed with a group of friends to take in the IEOAâs Christmas Truck Light Parade in December. Check in was a breeze and actually an enjoyable experience. The staff went out of their way to make us feel like we were number one. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel when in Victoria, excellent location for shopping and sightseeing. Room Tip: Rooms not facing Johnson Street are probably quieter."
POSITIVE,"This is the fourth time I have stayed in the Pepper Tree Santa Barbara CA. It's probably the best value hotel in the area, its a good location, the staff are pleasant and friendly and the hotel is well looked after. Surprisenly the weather in Santa Barbara was poor this July-11 when we were there, it was foggy/cloudy in the mornings and didn't clear up until the afternoon and temperatures didn't get above the mid sixties so we didn't feel like using the hotel pools however we cannot blame the hotel on the weather. We went to Max's cafe/restaurant for a freshly cooked breakfast every morning as it's good quality food. It is about half a mile along State Street heading into Santa Barbara. We drove to Goleta a few times to eat at the Outback, have Cold Stone ice cream or do some 10pin bowling ( Goleta is about 20 mins drive away). You can walk across the street from the Pepper Tree to the Marmalade Cafe, its a bit more expensive and it's worth trying to see a menu in advance to be sure it has something for you."
POSITIVE,Little way out of town so you have to drive into the centre but parking is easy. Best room so far for families as we had a king plus 2 pullout sofa beds so the kids didn't have to share a bed.
NEGATIVE,Bed was hard and pillows were lumpy! Shower-head needs replacement. Towels were rough. Need I say more!
POSITIVE,We held our daughter's wedding at the Eden on August 7th. My daughter was very particular as to how the room should be set and everything was absolutely perfect. The banquet servers were very attentive and catered to our every need. I stayed with my daughter in the Lancaster Suite on Saturday night. When we discovered that we needed an extra blanket and some pillows we called the desk and got them immediately. Our whole experience was exeptional and i would recommend the Eden if you're looking for a place to hold an event.
POSITIVE,"We were actually only at this place for one night, but it was very nice. We shared a two room suite with friends. Lots of activities for the kids to play (basketball, pool, shuffleboard) as well as a pool, playground and water play station. It was extremely nice! Great chance for friends to catch up while the kids played. I liked the ""quiet"" sign in the front hallway (it was after 11 when we got back from dinner). Another nice touch was plenty of towels/washcloths and a paper cover on the remote indicating it had been cleaned (or maybe you were supposed to push the buttons through the paper cover - not sure but a nice touch). Room had coffee maker also, with nice coffee/tea selection. The only negative thing were some of the front desk staff and getting the room that my friends had reserved. My friends generously paid for my half of the room, but encountered some difficulty trying to get the room they had reserved (had to switch once got into the first room and there was only one room, despite having booked the two room suite), and to get a rollaway bed for my kids (which we really did not need, but my friend had extreme difficulty in getting this for us until I told them I really didn't need one anyway - one adult and two kids slept in the queen bed without problems). I think for the rate the friends paid (plenty), the staff should have been more accommodating. Staff gave great directions to the place and were generally very nice. Had discount tickets to Hershey's available, which was great. Took a peek in the workout room which was slightly smaller but very functional in appearance - did not venture onto the machines in there. The pool had a very vigilant and competent lifeguard also. Highly recommend this place for a wonderful time to catch up with friends! Overall great place; nice and clean and the kids had a wonderful time!"
POSITIVE,Our family has taken a summer family vacation every year for the past 4 years and have stayed at the Best Western Eden Resort and Suites. We love this hotel. The rooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly. The new pool area complex is beautiful! We have stayed at a good amount of hotels (on family vacations and business) and this one is our favorite by far! We can't wait to stay there again next summer!
POSITIVE,The Eden did a great job with today's Professional Women's Forum. When the line was too long getting breakfast and coffee they set up another table so women could move more quickly. In the midst of a large group coming in Rebecca at the front desk and Wayne were especially helpful to me moving exhibit articles I was unable to move myself. Eden staff were quick to help in whatever ways needed during our event.
POSITIVE,"My family of 5 - two adults and 3 kids under 3 years old enjoyed our stay here in August 2011. We only stayed one night and went to Dutch Wonderland and Cherry Crest Farm. Next year we plan to stay for 3 nights! The pool is PERFECT for little kids - safe and fun! After an hour of being there, most parents were all conversating - all the kids played together! You can order food and drinks from the restaraunt delivered poolside. There is a great playground and basketball court! And the breakfast buffet was awesome! I highly recommend this hotel!"
POSITIVE,"Our stay was brief, but enjoyable. I liked that there was a restaurant within the resort with reasonable prices. It was raining heavily and I appreciated not having to haul everyone out in the weather just for dinner. The bathroom was super nice - granite countertops and double sinks, even a stool and magnifying mirror for applying make-up! The king bed was comfortable, but the fold-out bed where the children slept smelled like pizza! We used the hot tub, which was very nice, but all the balconies overlooking the indoor pool area is a little odd. It seemed to be all families during our stay - I'm sure people stay for business, but this place is crawling with kids!! Overall, a good value and I'd stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I had to attend training in Lancaster, PA and this resort was recommeded. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Lancaster area. The rooms were immaculate and the food at the restaurant was very good."
POSITIVE,"The property is truly a gem in the desert. The rooms are spacious attractive and clean with plenty of drawer space. The staff is very personable, friendly, and helpful. The fitness room is fully equipped with aerobic and strength training equipment and is far superior to many fitness rooms in much larger hotels. The hotel has a lovely pool which we did not have time to enjoy. The hotel is connected to the casino which offers a large variety of slot machines and at least two eating options. We drove from Phoenix to this hotel and using the GPS provided by Hertz in our rental car, we had no trouble finding this hotel. As one other reviewer indicated, because the Best Western sign is not as visible or obvious as it could be, at first glance you might see only casino and not the Best Western."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here during our stay in January. The room was clean and very quiet. The location is perfect, within walking distance to everything. The staff was great with directions and places to eat and see. Would definitely stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Our room was small which was expected since I booked a ""traditional"" bargain rate room. The room was very clean, in good condition and well appointed. The hotel is well located in relation to the most popular restaurants and night spots. The free parking is a bonus. The extra cost breekfast buffet offers a quick and nice traditional full breakfast. Two nitpicky complaints: there is no placard identifyling the station numbers for the networks shown on the quality high-def TV, and the bedside reading lights are actually way too bright."
POSITIVE,"Excellent location, you can walk to Market, Marion Square (farmerâs market on weekends) East Bay St. and anywhere else wearing good walking shoes. Recently remodeled with convenient, free parking under the hotel. The staff is super friendly and quick to help you with any question you might pose. They really want to help! We did not take a dip in the pool since it was a bit cool in December, but we thought this second floor pool area facing the street would be a fabulous spot to spend a hot afternoon, ordering drinks from the bar. We had the junior suite in the corner, what appears to be the largest room in the hotel, with a sitting area. It was great to have the space. Full length windows look onto the street with light-blocking shades for complete privacy. On the other side of the room the windows opened to let in a sea breeze. When closed, most sound from outside was significantly muffled and we were not disturbed. Had an issue with the cable not working, the bellman came right up and figured that out. Nice comfortable bed with quality linens. We LOVED the magnifying mirror in the bath! One morning housekeeping called to see if we needed service and woke my husband who was still sleeping. But we mentioned it to the desk and it did not happen again. Thereâs a restaurant on site which we did not try. Great hotel in a beautiful city. Room Tip: Hallways can be long, narrow and far from the elevator. Consider this when checking in if you cannot walk too far."
POSITIVE,"We arrived on October 31, and departed on November 3. Being there during the week is an advantage. The reservation: I made the reservation through a rewards plan, which paid for one night. I paid the rest of the stay. This went without a hitch. Confirmed with the hotel the day before we traveled; the front desk was very helpful. At that time, I requested a room on the lowest floor, near the elevator. The front desk honored this request. We were visiting Charleston with some friends. The hotel reserved our rooms next door to each other. Overall reservation experience: 5 stars!!! Checking in: Very smooth! Staff: From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and served with courtesy and the proverbial Southern Hospitality. Being Southern ourselves, we appreciated this. We arrived on Hallowe'en, and every staff member was costumed. Fun!!! Staff were helpful, responsive to every need and request, overall, just wonderful! Staff are exceptionally well-informed on locations of attractions, routes, menus, price ranges. The bartender made dinner reservations for us twice. The bellman, Johnny, was very clear on routes to negotiate Charleston's one-way streets. The housekeepers were lovely. The room: Because of the hotel's vintage, the rooms, including the bathrooms, are a little small. Even so, they are comfy. The beds are fine. There is a variety of pillows. The linens are good. The mattress is OK, but--for a luxury hotel--could be better. The bath: As mentioned, it is small, but OK. In addition to the overhead shower, there is a personal shower, which we did not use. The water pressure was good, and there was always plenty of hot water--an absolute must-have! The complementary toiletries were good quality. The bath linens were not luxurious, but were OK. The design of the bath was nice, all extras being tucked away in the furniture-style vanity. The room and bath are very clean! The restaurant: The restaurant opens for breakfast at 6:30 a.m. I'm not sure about lunch, because we were gone all day. Breakfast is not complementary; something at least along the lines of a complementary ""continental"" breakfast would be nice, considering the cost of the hotel. They don't charge for coffee, and there is a coffee bar in the lobby area, as well as in the restaurant. There is a good variety of hot and cold items on the breakfast buffet. In keeping with the wonderful staff, the ladies in the restaurant were absolutely lovely--so nice early in the morning! I requested honey for my coffee; the server got it to me immediately with a manner that would lead one to believe it was the high point of her day. We encountered 2 problem areas. 1) The coffee urns don't keep the coffee hot. They ranged from tepid to very warm. The coffee itself may have been some sort of Charleston style (chickory?), so many people may like it. 2) The milk in the cereal station was off, and just beginning to sour. We mentioned the milk to one of the servers, who apologized. The bar: The hotel has a ""manager's cocktail hour"" beginning at 4:30 p.m. There are decent prices for drinks and a complementary tray of fruit, cheese and crackers. The young bartender really knows how to mix a drink--even a dry martini, which seems to be a lost art. The bar stock is not huge, but it is very good. The seating is pretty comfy, with several standard table-and-chair areas and a more plush sofa-easy chair area. More about the bartender: He keeps a notebook with all kinds of restaurant and attraction info, including menus. Again, he made reservations for us twice. With the kinds of assistance he provides, there is absolutely no chance of being blindsided when you set out for dinner. Overall, they do an excellent job in a small area. Parking: The King Charles did a really good job with the on-site parking. It is well off the street, and very secure. In our case, we could see our car from our room. Security: There are 2 entrances to the the hotel. 1) You can enter directly at the front desk area. 2) You can use your room key to enter from the parking area. Hotel staff keeps good visuals on the parking area. We felt very secure. Location: This is an ideal location in the historic district. The market is close. Unless you decide to visit the plantations, there is no need to use your car. We walked to the aquarium and the Fort Sumpter tour area. Restaurants, such as Jestine's, FIG, Hank's, Poogan's Porch, are all within easy walking distance, even for us ""seniors"". For those who don't want to walk, the trolley operates up and down the street, and tour buses stop right at the hotel door. Overall appearance: The King Charles--again, a vintage hotel--is an attractive facility. The exterior and interior capitalize on the ""vintage"" aspect without seeming old or seedy, and seems thoroughly at home with itself in Charleston. The decor is understated and nice, completely avoiding any trace of commercialism. In the King Charles, you are in a most pleasant environment. In summary: I would love to give this place a 5. Again, it just barely misses. Room Tip: We opted for a regular king room, rather than the balcony suites. We were not in the room enough to make the balcony a valuable amenity. Always specify the location you want when you make a reservation at any hotel. We, for instance, prefer a lower floor and proximity to the elevator. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at king Charles multiple times and have never been disappointed. Rooms are clean, staff is very friendly and helpful and parking is free which is important in Charleston.. Nibbles are served at happy hour in a very comfortable lounge condusive to visiting."
POSITIVE,"The employees were very friendly while checking in/out. We used this just as a place to sleep so no experience w/the restaurant, pool or workout facility. Great location to the river and park, right off 205. The walls were thin so that we could hear our neighbors next door, our bed squeaked, very narrow entry way w/the door barely missing the wall as it swings open, but the shower had fabulous water pressure. The room was clean and the hotel served our purposes."
POSITIVE,"Spent 12/5 here and it was fine, we were able to leave our car there and take a shuttle from there to the airport. Rooms were comfortable and clean and staff friendly and helpful. Pick up at the airport was fast (unlike some of the park and fly facilities we have used in the past). The room rate, which included 4 days parking, was the same as the one night room rate. We stayed there when we got back for one night and were pleased, also."
POSITIVE,Liked: Rooms
POSITIVE,"Very clean, large room, steps to beach, spa in every room"
POSITIVE,"Our party of ten stayed at this Best Western for a week and our experience was a good one. The staff was very helpful with our particular needs and their restaurant recommendations led us to some delicious meals. The all-suite rooms were very clean and nicely appointed...fireplaces, some gas some wood which the hotel supplies free of charge and will even start it for you, jet tubs and very spacious showers were a favorite, and the complimentary breakfast was definitely elevated above the usual fare. Some of the website photos were misleading. This property is not nestled in the woods, it's right in town in a busy area with a combination of residential and business traffic. They don't have a shuttle into the central town square area, but there is a bus stop right at the property. I suggest you have your own transportation. The complimentary wifi was occasionally temperamental and their tv channel lineup is severly lacking. The layout of the property was a little awkward. Our group was split between the main building and another wing with a different entrance. As mentioned by other posters, the architecture and carved bears around the entrance was unique. Overall, this location worked very well for our purposes and we would stay here again. Room Tip: Ask for a room in the main wing, splurge on the upscale suite if you can. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This is a nice hotel, although the floor plan of the hotel is somewhat awkwardly laid out (apparently they added a wing onto it, and the wing is only accessible from the first floor down a LOOOONG corridor). We enjoyed our stay, and it was the best hotel we stayed in on our trip the the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Rooms are spacious and nicely laid out, with a refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker. The breakfast was quite good, and the serving room was quite large, and easily accommodated everyone. The rooms have pull out sofas, which I think is a popular feature for those with young families. There are a lot of families at this hotel too, so be prepared for all that entails - crowded swimming pools, messy breakfast room, running in the hallways, etc."
POSITIVE,"Stayed for one night on a family trip through Tetons/Yellowstone. We really enjoyed the newer hotel with all the bear and outdoor motif. Breakfast was busy but very good, with outages refilled quickly. The bathroom toilet paper dispenser was placed somewhat out of reach of my wife and daughter. Strange. Over 200 bucks plus tax. Ouch--Welcome to Jackson. However, one of the nicest Best Westerns in which we've stayed."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here on our way to the redwoods. Lodging choices were limited and was concerned with the quality of the hotel. To my surprise it was better than I expected. Spacious clean room, wine & cheese in the afternoon and a good hot breakfast. Our room overlooked the pool and spa area which is nicely landscaped. Easy walk to local shops and eateries. Only draw back was the vast amount of homeless people on the streets."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here over Halloween weekend 2011 with friends. If you want to visit Busch Gardens/Williamsburg and your looking to spend your money at the park/shops, come here. It's got what most travelers need: clean rooms, decent amentities - freewifi/free parking/cable/indoor pool/hot tub/ free breakfast, and good/helpful staff, This is your place. If you need a deluxe suite with marble bathrooms, stylishly appointed bedroom with linens, lace, picturesque views, room service, a hotel bar, yadda yadda yadda don't come here. I'd stay here again. It was close to BG, Williamsburg outlets, Captain George's seafood restuarant and a number of waffle houses. (side note: receptionist alexis was super cute and very nice.)"
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, comfortable rooms, free- fast internet, Nice breakfast included in price. I would definately stay here again."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is new, modern, has complimentary breakfast, and 24 hour shuttle service to the airport, which is only 2 to 3 minutes away."
POSITIVE,"Our family of 4 (w/2 teenagers) only spent 1 night at this hotel on our recent 'Wild West' vacation but had we known it was going to be so nice and delightful we would've stayed longer! The service was warm, sincere and attentive, the room was just right - large enough for a rollaway with plenty of room to maneuver - and well-kept including Direct TV and a large flat panel screen, the grounds were well-appointed with outdoor seating, free beverages, and a heated pool, and the full breakfast was spot on as well. If you are ever nearby, make a point of staying here. Even after this review, you will still be pleasantly surprised how much you liked it!"
POSITIVE,"We stay here often. Always clean, always helpful, courteous staff, good conteniental breakfast in the morning. This motel is used by serious travelers who are generally quiet and courteous."
POSITIVE,It was nice a comfortable but the housekeeping needs work. Front dest was very friendly made us feel welcomed at all times. But the keeping of the hotel really needs some work. We would stay again but hope the rooms are cleanier. They left their supplies behind didnt pick up when sweeping the bathroom garbage we didnt leave under the sink was still [?] there the last day we left/
POSITIVE,We were getting to border late and wanted a room just past the crossing in Canada. This hotel is right on the highway about 1/4 mile from the border crossing. Perfectly convenient. We had a room in the back and left the window open without any disturbance from highway noise. (There was very little traffic - maybe a sigh of the times). The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was nice and comfortable. The restaurant had closed when we got there - but there is a truck stop restaurant on the other side of the highway. A nice full breakfast was included in the rate. All in all we were very happy with this hotel.
POSITIVE,"Good place to stay close to the airport, only 10 minutes away. IHOP just up the street although breakfast is included and was sufficient."
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed with my 2 grandchildren at this hotel. It was exceptionally clean, staff was friendly, place felt safe, and the indoor pool was terrific!"
NEGATIVE,see review
POSITIVE,"arrived a few houra early. Front desk staff was friendly and although our room wasnt ready they offered to take our luggage (no thanks we will leave in rental car). we walked around and had lunch. When we returned our room was ready. Room was basic, but clean!!!!! it had 2 beds which were clean and comfortable. There was a mini fridge , microwave, coffee maker. Bathroom had a nice shower with awesome water pressure. Checkout was fast and they let us park there for hours after checkout. overall great place."
POSITIVE,The service was great. Rooms very comfortable and spacious. I plan to return.
POSITIVE,"Hotel room was very tiny by comparison to US hotels, but the best was extremely comfortable and staff was extremely helpful!! Great location to nearby tube Earl's Court Station."
POSITIVE,"We checked in late and checked out again early the next morning, so we cant judge the pool etc. but we found the hotel to be extremely conenient for our visit to six flags. The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were friendly. It didnt bother us being near a freeway, as you didnt hear much of the traffic noise in the room. The price was good compared to other hotels in the immediate vicinity, but a little more than we would normally go for."
NEUTRAL,We booked this hotel as just a place to rest before our early morning flight. We like the Best Western chain. Upon entry it seemed a bit tired but the room was clean and it had a tv that worked. The breakfast was a good way to start the day. Remember you just needed a place to stay for one night and the price was not sky high. It is close to eateries and the airport.
NEUTRAL,"the hotel itself was fine. The location leaves a bit to be desired. It is in an older industrial area and right across the street from active train tracks. the room shook when the trains went by. Pretty close to the air force base as well: in addition to the train, there was plenty of loud air traffic."
POSITIVE,"A great hotel with all the the facilities you need when traveling. Good breakfast every morning, Free WiFi, Desk, Sofa, Refrigerator, Microwave own, Iron in all rooms. The staff at the reception is extremely customer focused and willing to help. (Ask for Kay) For the price price payed (65USD/Night), this is excellent value. Stayed a week at this hotel during a training course at ETS-Lindgren."
POSITIVE,"Close location to airport and major hwy 0 out of 1 people found this review helpful, did you? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Loved, loved, loved our stay!! Great location, great rooms, great breakfast, great tv, great pool, great beds/pillows!! I was overly satisfied with every aspect of our stay at this hotel. We had stayed here several years back when it was a Days Inn... nothing to write home about, just a basic place close to our destinations (mall/zoo) Best Western has really done this property a big favor.. Like I said, it was all exceptional. Close, even walking distance to MOA... an IHOP, TGIFridays and Chevy's in walking distances, along with an Itailian place connected to the hotel, although we did not eat there. There is a free shuttle to the mall, but only a 1 minute drive!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is located right across the way from Macy's at the Mall of America. Our room was very nice, clean and reasonably spacious. The hotel has a zero-depth children's ""water playland"", along with a regular pool, and a separate whirlpool. The pool area is very large and has a lot of seating around it. Very nice for families. The fitness center is located in a small room on the first floor. Not very inspiring, although they did have it well stocked with towels. We tried to check in at 2:30 (1/2 hour before check-in time). The guy behind the desk was unfriendly and unhelpful. He told us check in wasn't until 3:00 and that we should go to the mall. He then just stared at us. No offer to store our bags, go get a drink, etc.... I expected ""Minnesota nice"" and we got a robot. I would stay here again for the hotel, although I think the staff could use some customer service training. Room Tip: The pool area (open 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) is noisy. I would imagine that noise would spill into the rooms around the pool."
POSITIVE,"no problems. clean room, good a/c, good staff."
POSITIVE,"I live here, and my A/C went down. And I've got THREE doggies. AND it was Mayweather fight weekend. Pickins wuz SLIM. GLAD they had space here! But I'm making the effort to post here because of something I discovered on my own that I want to share. I asked the desk ""Where's the best place to walk the dogs"" to which they just sorta pointed at the driveway. Nuh-uh. Two of my 3 won't poop while on a leash (24/7 doggie door at home). We walked a ways, and LO & BEHOLD, about one city block north of the property was an approx. 2-acre vacant lot, FENCED ON ALL 4 SIDES, with a gate big enough to drive a car thru which you can close behind you...in other words, IMPROMPTU DOG PARK!!! Trust me, fellow dog people - that find makes this place THE BEST pet-friendly property in Vegas! You're welcome."
POSITIVE,"My family stayed at the Best Western Abby Inn for the St. George Marathon this past weekend and we had an excellent time. The rooms were clean and very nice. The service was superb! My kids had a blast playing in the pool and soaking in the hot tub. The breakfast was first class as well. I was impressed with all the arrangements made for the runners the morning of the race, early breakfast and shuttle service was provided. If your considering a hotel to stay at while your in St George...choose the Abby Inn you won't be disappointed. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
NEUTRAL,"This is a handy stop over hotel or if on a tight budget then is close to the train links for 30 min transfer to centre of N.Y.C. We used the hotel as it was the best priced,handy location for airport and train as we had a one day stop over which allowed us to dump bags in room and have several hours in the city before catching early flight next morning. Rooms were clean and big,no complaints.Shuttle transfer took a bit of time as kept waiting at airport for 20 min whilst several other hotels dropped off and collected at least twice! Minor complaint though and hotel is decent value for money. Did not eat at hotel due to early flight. Shuttle transfer needs to be quicker/more frequent."
NEUTRAL,"quietness air conditioning secluded, but easy to find from interstate Nice room, desk chair was torn. air conditioning took to cool room."
POSITIVE,"My work brought me to Durango, CO for five weeks. I tend to travel quite a bit and staying long periods of time in a hotel is nothing new to me. I have to say that my stay at Mountain Shadows was absolutely the BEST experience I have had with a hotel during my travels. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. So much so that now that I have arrived back in LA I actually miss their smiling faces. (Seriously...that is a first for me) The room was spacious and very comfortable. The furnishings are new. There is a microwave and a mini fridge in the room which really cut down on having to go out to restaurants to eat. The bathroom area has granite tops and the shower has granite walls. The water pressure and temperature was consistently perfect. They also offer breakfast in the morning. Which has a nice selection of food. I will miss the really tasty belgian waffles that you cook yourself! The location is also great. The free trolly that runs up and down Main Ave picks you up about 50 ft from the hotel. The walls are apparently very thick because i never heard anyone who was staying in the rooms next to me. There is also a pool and jacuzzi which is actually covered by a dome. Which is perfect because it snowed quite a lot during my stay but I was able to enjoy the facilities regardless of the outside temperature. I also noticed how clean everything stayed. The pool area was always immaculate. The water in both pool and jacuzzi was always clean and clear. And the perfect temperature too. The staff that actually cleans your room were extrememly helpful and consistently friendly. I will absolutely stay there every time I visit Durango. Also there is a grocery store and a liquor store on the next street. Seriously awesome Hotel! Oh! and one more thing!!!! The towels! I have never stayed at a hotel where the towels smelled fresh and were actually soft and absorbant. I think a lot of hotels use chemicals when they wash their towels to try to preserve them as long as possible.Thankfully not this place! All the towels as well as the bed linens and duvet were fresh and soft. Which really makes a difference when you are staying at a hotel for such a long period of time."
POSITIVE,"This is the third time we've stayed at this hotel when visiting family in RI. It is clean, comfortable, quiet and very close to everything. Definitely recommend for the quality for the price."
POSITIVE,"Spent two nights at the BW in December 2011. The pool was great and my son loved the hot tubs. I would highly recommend this hotel if looking to save a few bucks and don't mind getting in the car for 5 minutes to get to the falls (This is exactly what we wanted). We stayed here mainly due to the free parking, but keep in mind that if you drive to the falls, they charge $18 to park your car at the main parking site. You may find something cheaper and more convenient like on-street parking that fits your needs, but we were short on time so paid the daily fee right at the falls. Nothing bad to say about this hotel. If your looking for a downtown hotel with a view of the fall from your room, this is not it, however it is convenient, close to Clifton Hill and a decent price. Can't go wrong here! Room Tip: Stayed in the tower and loved it."
POSITIVE,"We stayed there again this year (have stayed at this hotel for the past few years) and again, it was nice, got good service but I got a bit ticked off for a few things... During the night from Saturday to Sunday, it was very noisy in the pool area. Although it's written no noise after 11:00, I think there was a baseball team staying at the hotel and the men were loud. It was hard to rest. This is not the hotel's fault though and all the other nights after have been quiet. As for the cleanliness of the hotel, generally speaking, it's a nice, big and clean hotel. Very comfortable. This time around though I found that the bathroom wasn't ""as clean"" as it could have been. Again, this is not the first time we stay there but it's the first time I've noticed a few ""issues"". Nothing major of course! The beds have been changed along with the pillows - nice, comfortable beds! :) Thank you! Other than that, the hotel is undergoing renos or construction... it might bother some people but really, we didn't hear a thing while we were there. The staff at the ""Windows on the Lane"" restaurant was friendly, as always. Food was good, prices ok. I wonder where Lucy the bird went ... she was not at her usual spot in the lobby. We will be back and of course I recommend this hotel to any travellers going to Niagara Falls, ON. Close to restaurants, grocery store, drug store, Tim Hortons, Starbucks, close to the Falls."
NEGATIVE,"This was not our first stay at this hotel but I can tell you it is our last. We had trouble booking the reservation and when checked in even though it was in my name the clerk insisted my husband sign in and unbeknowst to us the hotel reserved a large amount of money on our credit card. Upon checking my credit card online I discovered this and questioned the clerk, he said was standard hotel procedure, I questioned if that was true, why wasn't I advised and why is there no documentation anywhere backing this up. He could not answer me. We got to our room, noticed there was no fridge and microwave and the lock on the sliding glass door was broke. Appareantly fridge and microwave are not standard anymore you can have for a fee. We had a package deal for 2 of our meals, the first night was great after that a washout. When we checked out I was handed the bill and was more than I was quoted, the clerk said that is the package price and since we were never given the original papers that my husband signed even though he asked for it, I couldnt prove anything . I gave her my Best Western card for points and she had problems putting thru but finally did. Then I find out the hotel refused to give me the 250 points saying was package deal then why did you take my card. At the end of the day this was a horrible stay at the Best Western Fallsview and would never go back. I feel that if hotels are going to be sneaky like that and not be up front with their policies, then I can find a better honest hotel to stay at. Room Tip: Check out your room before you sign in and ask all kinds of questions regarding hotel policies prior to booking. See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,"I recommended this hotel to our friends who were visiting from abroad. I am embarrassed as the staff where incredible rude to them. From the time the checked in to the time they checked out they received not a single smile from the staff, when they asked questions they were given short and abrupt answers. They asked for coffee in there room as there was a coffee maker and no coffee and were told to go across the street to the Tim Hortons. They found a cup full of cigarette butts on the balcony and were told that is where people smoke, they have a little boy who could have easily gotten to this. Upon check in they were told the rate. Nothing was said that it did not include breakfast or that taxes would be added at the end (they live in a country were taxes are included in all the prices already). When they went to check out they were charged for parking even though they did not have a car as I dropped them off and picked them up. When they asked to speak to a Manager, she came out had a sour look on her face and told them they were in Canada now and that is how it is done over here, deal with it. Then told them if they didn't pay they would call the police on them. Never again will I stay, recommend or go near this hotel!!"
POSITIVE,"Service was good, the rooms were clean and comfortable but not extraordinary. The food was good. The lack of elevators means you must carry your luggage upstairs by yourself."
POSITIVE,"Room was huge, comfortable, attractive. Great bed and bedding. Nice colors and furnishings. And it's probably the only time I've actually had any desire to use the tub in a hotel to take a bath - great corner type jacuzzi, filled up fast, felt great. The lamps could use bulbs with a little more wattage, and I personally didn't like the shower head (directly above and too much flow restriction makes it less than ideal, though it's a relatively expensive model) but those are the only negative things I can think of. Overall a great lodging experience. This will be my choice anytime I'm in the area."
POSITIVE,"The weekend of January 7th we stayed at the Best WesternPremier Governors Suites. Normally, we stay at the nearby LaQuinta which is just down the road from my inlaws. The LaQuinta has gone down sharply and we needed to find another hotel in the same price range and same area. We had seen many cars with windows broken into and security guards who were sleeping in their vehicle at the La Quinta so we decided it was time to move on. I am so glad we found the Best Western. It is very clean, the staff is very helpful and the room was much nicer than I expected. The overall feeling is that this is a clean & safe hotel. We don't need a fancy 5 star style hotel when we go to visit the family but this hotel exceeded all my expectations. They have a great breakfast that is included in the room rate. Unlike The LaQuinta, security is not a huge priority. You don't see security guards everywhere, but you certainly feel safer here. I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in this area of Little Rock."
POSITIVE,"If you want an experience you will be talking about for months after your stay...book yourself into this wonderful hotel. You feel like you are in a 5 star resort. It's oceanfront, and they mean it, it's not a term they stretched, you are literally on the water. The hotel looks like a full blown resort with a wonderful restaurant. The food is as good as you'd get in a 4 diamond restaurant. They have meeting space for 200 people. I'd love to hold my next company meeting here! I could live at this property, the rooms are so gorgeous and spacious. I can't wait to go back, I'm bringing my family this summer. Room Tip: Ask for the interior rooms facing the ocean."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. We opted to stay a little further out from where my relatives live after a horrible experience at another hotel. This hotel was clean, bathrooms were a nice size with a great bath/shower, staff was extremely nice, breakfast was good for a continental breakfast (big selection), and given that the hotel sits in a very busy area (shopping centers and restaurants surround it), it was quiet. We were concerned that with ""Black Friday"" the area would be packed with people and traffic at a stand still, but we were surprised that this wasn't the case. The hotel sits behind a Best Buy, but even that wasn't bad. We actually enjoyed seeing the people lined up from the front to way past the rear of the building, but everyone was quiet. Given that it was a holiday week, the price was right on target with the quality of the hotel. Pleasantly surprised with a Best Western. Good job!"
POSITIVE,Hotel was neat and clean. The room was as good as it gets for the price. A lot of places nearby. The only issue was the entrance from the frontage road was under construction so you had to enter well before you got to the hotel.
POSITIVE,"When I got there, they did not have my room available. This was because I booked online after midnight, so they were expecting me for the following day. Still, they found me a room and did not even charge me for the first day. The location is really great, right on the Chesapeake Bay beach and not difficult to get to. Parking is ample and easy. The standard room I got for my first two nights was very small, but cozy and had everything I needed. The TV could be newer and beds could be a bit more comfortable, but it was a very nice hotel for the price. Staff was very nice and accomodating."
POSITIVE,My son and I stayed at Naperville Inn during visit to Wheaton College. Chose hotel based on location and tripadvisor reviews. It was just as advertised- not fancy but clean and comfortable and a great location to get to Wheaton. I thought it was a good hotel for the price and would stay there again.
POSITIVE,The breakfast foods that I got were stale and moldy. Bagels.
POSITIVE,"Rooms are excellent, the view of the lake amazing and the hot tube really nice. We stayed for three nights and the service was really good. Room Tip: Facing the lake."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here with my husband & son on a college visit to Wesleyan. Nice exterior, lobby, breakfast area & room. Comfy beds & pillows, free wi-fi, friendly, helpful staff. Normal breakfast offerings. Small indoor pool. Nice & quiet & clean. No problem getting extra pillows. Would definitely stay here again. Yes, it was maybe a 15 minute drive from Middletown, but worth saving some money on. Room Tip: Rooms in the back are quietest. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Free wifi, free short order hot breakfast, friendly staff. Shower was a bit tricky to work (older). Off major highway, pretty quiet. Each room had a balcony. Simple, clean, was quiet. Compliementary breakfast was the best - hot, short order, fast and easy. Free wifi was great for business use. No complaints, just right for the price. If you want business stuff like dry-cleaning, you need to do it manually (take to a cleaners)."
POSITIVE,"This Hotel was nice and quiet and very comfortable. There is dinning in walking distance from the hotel where if you show your room key they will give you a discount.Saving you some cash that's always a good thing. The Pool and hot tub were clean even after the storm that had gone through the night before. They have breakfast to order which is a nice change from most hotels. My Husband got a kick out of this , he said the service was better then he got at home. The hotel said the room came with a micro wave but there wasn't one in our room. The dead bolt didn't work on our door either. But it was a very nice room and I would stay there again when I'm in that area."
POSITIVE,"I know that I said I wouldn't stay here again, but I got an AMAZING rate ($37/night), so I decided to give them another shot. And they totally redeemed themselves :) No creepy night desk guy in evidence, king sized bed in a corner room, nice and quiet :) If I got another great rate, I'd go back!"
NEUTRAL,"Stayed at the Best Western Airport Inn a few weeks ago. Just one adult and a daughter. Easy to find, fairly close to the airport as advertised and a good rate. Not a hotel you want to stay at for a week but for a quick over night not terrible. Rooms were fairly clean but used, good hot water in the shower and a surprisingly comfy bed."
POSITIVE,"Best hotel when driving thru Winslow. I would stay here again. Friendly Staff! Best hotel in Winslow! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location"
POSITIVE,"The most comfortable beds, clean room, great breakfast that is included in the price! The ONLY thing is that if you are looking for a hotel near the airport it is not that close. There are others closer. As well, the location is in an industrial/business park. Not a great location for leisure travellers in that sense."
POSITIVE,"Hotel is on the lake, our room had a view of the lake, room was clean and comfortable. Service was excellent. They were very busy while we were there but room was always cleaned and made up by the time we got back in the evening. Breakfast was limited but good....However you can't beat the location, right on the mariners trail easy to walk along the lake, you are right downtown, so you can walk to restaurants and shops. It's right next to the maritime museum, and just a short walk to Beernsteens, for a little ice cream or candy or both."
POSITIVE,"Our three day trip to Chicago was great! The people at the front desk were nice and helpful. You can walk to just about all the sites and the ones you can't walk to, you can take the bus or L train to. Free parking is a HUGE plus as it costs about 50 bucks a night everywhere else. Our suite was spacious and had 2 TVs. We were very pleased with our stay. [?] Highly reccomended!"
POSITIVE,"Nice big room with a nice recliner and excellent tv. New Mexican restaurant with good food, price, and service. Breakfast included with good choices."
POSITIVE,"First off, this hotel was hard to find at night. It was nestled in between two businesses that hide the very narrow driveway to this hotel. In their defense, mammoth lakes at night is very dark. The address on buildings are not visible at all. Everything was ordinary in regards to service,amenities, and rooms. I was impressed with $89 special I was able to book online last minute (not inc tax/fees). The free breakfast was a great bonus. We stuffed our face"
POSITIVE,"We stayed for two nights at the Best Western. The rooms were spacious with few amenities like microwave and refrigerator in the room. It was conveniently located near restaurants, shops and ski rental stores. They serve a hearty breakfast every morning. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms and the hardware need a little upgrade. Our bathroom door handle broke on the last day. Overall a good hotel."
POSITIVE,This was our 4th stay at this hotel and we have been very satisfied with everything. Our son attends a nearby college and we love the proximity to the campus. I was impressed that this hotel offered a free HOT breakfast. I'm sick to death of thosecontinental breakfasts at other hotels. The rooms have been very good for our needs and we have never had a problem with late-night outside noises. The staff has always been accomodating to our needs as well. We will continue to stay here on future trips.
NEGATIVE,This hotel was filthy. The bathrooms smelt like mold. Will never stay here again.
POSITIVE,This is a well kept Best Western. The property is older but clean & updated. My room was clean. The sheets & towels were fresh. Bathroom was spotless. Like I said this is an older property but maintained well. You are on the Navajo Nation. There is a restaurant on property so no need to go anywhere else to eat. Good food. I believe this is the only pool in town. Anyway it is clean indoor & heated. Sauna too. Didnt try it. Our jeep tour driver Bobby picked us up at the hotel. Canyon is beautiful! Wow
POSITIVE,"Fancy - No Comfortable - Yes Customer Service - Excellent from ALL staff. Very friendly! Breakfast - Eggs, grits, bacon, juice, coffee-tea - yummy! Pet Friendly! I have stayed here several times, alone or with other family members and a pet. Great area for pet walking. Very quick response and remedy when there were minor problems with the room. I will be staying there again!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was convenient and clean and the kids enjoyed the pool However, the continental breakfast wasn't very impressive. There was very little fresh fruit - gone both mornings before 7am and very few donuts. We asked the front desk to restock, which they did, but those additional donuts were also gone in about 5 minutes. The cereal was also stale. The breakfast could use some inprovement."
POSITIVE,"This place is clean, close to the highway and tons of places to eat and shop.. Friendly staff and rates are reasonable."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was easily accessible and check in /out was very easy. The only concern I would share is the hotel is noisy. You could hear through the walls, and the traffic. Our room appeared clean, except I believe they forgot to vaccumn the carpet. Towels and linens were soft and clean."
POSITIVE,"Wasn't expecting much from a Best Western near Oakland Airport. But the price was reasonable (when several other hotels had jacked up their rates due to demand). The room was comfortable and clean, and the staff were friendly and efficient. Free parking and decent breakfast completed the good impression. I'll remember this option for future trips."
NEGATIVE,It was a nice place but the personal in the front desk was not helpful. Pros: the location Cons: the personal in the front desk Location: it was perfect
POSITIVE,"I was very pleased with this Best Western. Built in the 70's, it's been updated and has nice furnishings in the rooms and lobby. The staff was courteous and the location is great, if you don't want to stay on beautiful Tablerock Lake, but want to be within walking distance of Old Town Branson, The Landing shopping area, and Lake Taneycomo, and a short driving distance to the multitude of live theatre productions. I was also pleased to have a larger-than-average refrigerator, a flatscreen TV, microwave, and a bathroom area with a separate vanity. Even though the room was designated ""smoking"" (there were no non-smoking rooms available), the room smelled pleasant and I could not tell it had been a ""smoking"" room. The price was very good and I will stay here again. This is located in the beautiful Ozark Mountains, which is lush and green in the summer and exceptionally beautiful with the changing leaves in the Fall, not to mention the 4 million lights which illuminate a nearby amusement park with a country flair, Silver Dollar City for the holidays (beginning the first weekend of November). Room Tip: The King Suite was roomy. We were upgraded because no regular King rooms were available."
NEGATIVE,"This is not an hotel but a motel. So when you know that, you should not have any surprise. What does that means *motel* ? This means that there's a lot of noise during the evening because diffÃ©rent kind of people are there. It means that the room are not really confortable, towels not confortable, room smells motel... Breakfast: fat and not really [?] good, in an old room... But the localisation is great, you can visit everything by walk. The price is OK for the quality. Frontdesk can also reserved tour for you with Grayline inc."
POSITIVE,"I actually liked this hotel. Everything was included, even bed bugs. I stayed one night, bid 45 on priceline so it was a good deal. Check in was no problem, the room was big and so was the bathroom. Room was also pretty clean. Not very noisy either. Slept well on a comfortable bed. The fitness center was average, but still better than most I've encountered. There was a treadmill, stationary bike, and elliptical - all were relatively new. Also a multi gym machine and a dumbbell rack and a tv on the wall. It was pretty small, it actually was shaped like all of the rooms, just without a bathroom - so it would be pretty darn crammed if there were more than 1 person using it. Breakfast is included as a free buffet in the restaurant, and it also was pretty good. Hot foods included - more than just do it yourself waffles. The business center worked just fine - 3 computers with internet access and an industrial printer/copier. It looked like the only pool is outdoors, and has a hot tub. The only bad note was that the evening I stayed there, while doing paperwork on the bed I noticed a bed bug crawling on the pillow. It might not have even been a bed bug, maybe a tick or a termite. I'm a low maintenance guy so I cast the pillow aside and slept on the bed with no problem. Didn't notice any bites or anything in the morning either. With the bed bug epidemic happening all over the country, its naive to think that they arent in every house/hotel/apartment/bed that isn't located in Antarctica. I don't think it's a very big deal so it doesn't worry me, but if this is a big concern for you - just inspect your room or steer clear."
POSITIVE,Very comfortable beds. Everyone was very nice and helpful. Will stay again for sure.
POSITIVE,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed here this year, and I will definitely use them again. The service is always good and the rooms clean. Both times we checked in early and there was no problem, our room was ready. This time we got an upgrade to a suite without even asking. The only problem we had was lack of hot water. We had to let the shower run [?] for 15 mins before we got hot water, but they said since it was in winter and less people staying there, that this could happen. We ate in the in-house restaurant last time for breakfast. The food was good, the waitress left a lot to be desired. Very grumpy old Russian lady! The pool is nice and the beach access is perfect. This hotel is so close to everything, shops, restaurants, beach, intercoastal waterway, etc. that you feel like you are in the center of it all, even though it is a quiet neighborhood."
POSITIVE,"Pulled in not knowing anything about this Best Western, just needed a place to sleep after driving 10 hours. Great value for the night; clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and great continental breakfast. Visited the hot tub to relax before going to bed and one of staff was there to check on the grounds and he asked if we needed anything or if the hot tub needed to be adjusted â very attentive. Overall, good amenities and a nice place to sleep."
NEGATIVE,"The good news was that we got to the motel early, so they rushed the room cleaning and got us checked in early, the bad news was the next morning we were making our bed and saw that our bottom sheets had old dried blood spots all the way down to the mattress, and it didn't come from us....uhggggg. The service desk didn't seem nearly as appauled as we were. We also ate at the Waves restaurant, service was good but food was overpriced and our scallops were raw in the middle. The motel is right on the beach and we really enjoyed the proximity and the lighthouse view was incredible. We would probably stay there again but we will be taking our own bedding.That was just disgusting. Pros: location Cons: cleanliness and restaurant"
POSITIVE,Location---wonderful view of the ocean just across the highway. Quiet and well -maintained. Excellent breakfast. Convenient pickup by city bus. Nicely away from the noise of Duval Street yet good access to whatever we wanted.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here with my wife and two kids (8 and 11), and we enjoyed the stay. We did not see anything wrong. Our kids liked the indoor swimming pool. We had a dinner at the restaurant connected to the hotel, and the food was just fine. Our room had a spectacular ocean view. We arrived at the hotel at 6:10pm and missed the sunset, but could see some remaining light over the ocean and it was beautiful. Our room was clean and spacious enough for our family. The breakfast was OK for me. Overall, I liked this hotel and will be back again, if I have a chance."
POSITIVE,"This Best Western is fabulous! The decor is 1st class with beautiful carpet in the hallways and with a lobby beautifully decorated for the holidays. The rooms have marbled counter tops with very nice chairs and tables. Drapes, bedding and in room carpets are clean, new and classy. Large flat screen TV and quick wi fi internet service works great. Although near a freeway, the well insulated windows block out all sound. The free breakfast is great in a quaint dining room. Coffee, juices, pancakes, eggs, bacon, potatoes, breads,, bagels muffins, breakfast bundt cakes and cereal make this a bargain included in your hotel rate! There is nothing but praise for this wonderful hotel and it lacks nothing. Friendly staff and quick check in make it a first-class experience!"
NEGATIVE,"The beroom was big They don't care about the customer The GPS give the wrong way to everybody, be carefull, it is at the entrance of the Bryce Canyon, not away. The GPS make you arriving in the wrong place (25 minutes too far). So, we get lost in a small village. The reception of the hotel never answer to the phone. We went in a shop and the women says it happens to everybody to go on the wrong way because of the GPS. When we arrived at the hotel and ask why they don't answer to the phone, they say it's our phone which is not working. Then, we ask for 2 bedrooms comunicating between each other. The man says it doesn' t exist. The day after, we saw bedrooms opened for cleaning and they were communicating like we wanted. So, we ask for a change. They gave us 2 other bedroom but then realize the bedroom is not freee and we were puting everything inside... We asked also that they put a note or a big advertising to say that the hotel is here and not where the Gps tell you to go and they didn't care... The staff was very unplesant..."
POSITIVE,Great place and value. We had there new breakfest menu and it was terriffic.
NEUTRAL,The beds were very comfortable and the fridge worked great. The breakfast they provided was very good. The location to downtown was very close and easy to get too. The upgrade work on some things in the bathroom and other places was done very sloppy. The breakfast was good but both days we went they let things run out.
NEGATIVE,"Bedbugs, bedbugs, bedbugs. A week long conference needed to be canceled because of the infestation. Not an isolated incident, literally two thirds of the rooms were infested and guests were an ample meal. Our corporation pulled the plug on an entire week after one night. Outside of the bugs, the staff was short and surly. Not a pleasant experience for an event or a room for the night. Beware!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel and it's staff were just tops! The hotel was nice and clean and housekeeping always did a fantastic job. The front desk staff were always very cordial and accomadating, even going so far as to show us what there was to do in town! I would highly recommend this property."
NEUTRAL,"Nice room for one night. Quiet, clean, safe. Close to airport. No long-term parking & shuttle runs once an hour, I think. Desk attendant was nice but not helpful with alternate parking arrangements. Booked SkyPark in San Bruno."
POSITIVE,"âNice family placeâ We stayed here on our trip to Disneyland and this was our first trip here for a extended stay. It was very nice spanish style deco. The room was nice and the continental breakfast was not to bad either. We paid a little extra for a ART pass to take us to the park daily and the trolley stops in front of the Inn. It was pretty quiet and we could see the fireworks from our balcony, which was nice. The parking lot and the pool are kind of small. Friendly staff was a plus. Overall it was not to bad for our first time. It's a great hotel but if any of you are looking to save some $$ then book it at SweetHotelDeals.Info They usually have some pretty good deals on there! Liked: Service, Value"
NEUTRAL,I have to say that the staffs were great. The maids were very nice. They had apples in the rooms which my daughter loved. One thing is we were not used to smaller rooms and smaller beds so it is harder for us.
NEUTRAL,"We have stayed at this location several times over the years. On our most recent visit we were pleased as usual. About five years ago, we noticed that the property was getting fairly dated. It was the kind of place we would probably have avoided. However, this time we were pleased to see that it had been renovated. The rooms are smaller than usual, but the furnishings were new and the bathrooms redone. Overall the room was very clean and pleasant. It seems a bit out of date now, but the rooms have outdoor entrances, no inside halls. In a way, this is nice since you can park right next to your room. This area is quite and calm enough that it is not a problem. The hotel has a really nice indoor pool that was nice and warm even during the frigid weather. The walk back to the room would be the problem in the winter! (Although they do have bathrooms for changing clothes near the pool) The breakfast was weak to say the least. It would have been the low point to our visit. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is not looking for luxury but is looking for a budget price, clean location."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean and the landscaping was well maintained. The pool was cleaned and there was plenty of room for people to swim and sit by the pool area without it feeling cramped. The room was spacious and had plenty of area for me and my three boys. The bathroom was very clean and I noticed that all the furniture had been recently replaced.Pros: The hotel was very clean, recently renovated, and had plenty of free parking. Cons: For bathroom amenities, there was only shampoo and bar soap available (no conditioner or lotion)."
POSITIVE,"Great, clean, nice, especially for the money which was very reasonable."
POSITIVE,"When we got to the hotel we had a mixed-up on our reservation, but the two Brandi's correct the problem. Brandi and Brandy were so nice. These ladies did an awesome job. I hope all my stays at Best Western is like the one we experienced in Canton Ga."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Nice property - spacious rooms, well maintained and clean. Cons: It is very large sometimes difficult to navigate."
POSITIVE,Good value for price .Pros: Priceline price. Cons: Entrance currently under construction.
POSITIVE,"Everything about the hotel it's self was great for my daughter and I. Not impressed with the parking and lack of. My daughter was also kind of scared when we came back in the late evening, not a good area."
NEGATIVE,We booked a two bedroom and when we arrived they gave us a one bedroom for three people. The room was extremely small for three people and when we asked to get a two bedroom they said they were all booked up until after we were scheduled to leave. Also the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan so it smelled musty. The internet access for extremely slow if you could even connect at all and they had an electrical problem with the fire alarm so it went off at 6AM and the entire hotel had to evacuate.
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay for the night. we arrived at DTW after midnight called for the shuttle. The shuttle was waiting for us and took us back to DTW to pick up our rental car in the morning. Extremely quiet, nice breakfast and the pool and hot tub were extremely clean. Equipment in the fitness center in need of repair but would definitely book another night if I have a late night arrival."
POSITIVE,"Travelling through with our family and stayed one night. Very impressed with this hotel. Nice and clean, modern yet simple, friendly staff, great sleep with the two queen beds. The hot breakfast was awesome. Nice large modern eating room with a variety of things to eat. We would stay here again and would recommend."
POSITIVE,"Totally comfortable. None Perfect for visiting the Grand Canyon Nation Park This hotel has more amenities than hotels which rent for 3 times the nightly rate. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and clean. The location is excellent for access to the Grand Canyon National Park. This hotel has a great restaurant on the premises as well as a comfortable lounge with a fire place. All of the employees had a geat attitude and were very helpful. This hotel will cater to families with children as it has an arcade and an in house bowling alley( 6 lanes) !!"
NEGATIVE,"Pros: Excellent location. Nice rooms.Cons: Rooms have no heating, just air conditioners. Air conditioners are very noisy and not very good in heating. When it's 15-20 F outside, you have to choose between noise and freezing.Hotel staff is neither helpful nor friendly.The staff forgot to clean my room. When I called them they said they will send a maid to the room immediately, but then called back saying no one is available.However, they didn't forgot to hang an advertisement on the door handle."
NEGATIVE,"The room was in very poor condition with wall paper loose, stains on the curtains and chairs, very aged furnishings and an iron that didn't work. I asked the front desk to replace the iron, but they did not."
POSITIVE,"The hotel staff was extremely helpful. The complimentary breakfast was a wonderful convenience. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel was easy to locate. There was a grocery store across the street. I was in Hendersonville for the weekend on busineess. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful when I needed to fax a document. Knowing that I was headed to the airport very early the enxt day, he took the inititialtive of even printing out directions for me."
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay, everyone we encountered were very friendly and helpful. It's a nice walk to the Plaza. We would recommend this to anyone."
NEUTRAL,Pool Staff Close proximity to events but a little dreary part of town. Fridge ruined a lot of my food. My children have severe alergies and I travel with their food. The fridge leaked and the staff was very apathetic. Guess it didn't matter to them they got their money and sent me packing. Very bad experience.
POSITIVE,"We had the best weekend here. Great location....clean hotel...great price...fantastic ""adjoining"" rooms! We'll stay here every time! Pros: Location, ""adjoining"" rooms (two rooms in the corner adjoined by a tiny foyer!) Cons: Not one thing I did not like. Location: FABULOUS. Walking distance to restaruants, bars and the mall."
POSITIVE,The front desk stafff were very helpful and accommodating and they had the best cookies ever.
NEGATIVE,"We were on a 3 week road trip round California, Arizona and Utah. Merced seemed ideally placed for a trip to Yosemite. This hotel was a mistake. Reception was cool if not unfriendly, the room was ok, if dated, the A/C was the loudest I've ever heard, but the real killer is Highway 99, which is directly accross from the hotel. We couldn't use the pool as it had been taken over by a bunch of bikers for a pool party! There was virtually no food options close to the hotel and the whole area seems pretty run down.A hot and very noisey night followed and we were glad to be on our way. Room Tip: They will all be noisey."
POSITIVE,"Wonderful rooms on the ground floor near the office have a great fenced area for the dogs to go out from the back of the room. Previously I had stayed on the other side of the hotel and , although there is a great area to walk your pets in the parking lot, it meant getting up and dressed to walk the dog. Room 101 and on, you can sneak out the back to the fenced area and not worry about being seen. The breakfast was good enough, room clean and price decent. Will stay there again on my way to Oregon. Room Tip: ground floor on freeway side if you have pets"
POSITIVE,"Having read the ""armpit of a town"" I was leary to stay here. The town was a lovely little town shame on the person for calling small town America and armpit! And I was SHOCKED at the Best Western!! Shocked because I have stayed at Best Western's before and yes the majority are a $69.00 room at best but not the case with this place. I paid $149.00 and it was worth every penny! My room was lovely and updated, the dinner we had was exquisite for such a remote location and yes, the breakfast was just wonderful! The only issue we had was slow wifi but HELLO, the Grand Canyon is in the middle of no where. I would recommend this hotel. My Husband and I love traveling to our National Parks so we are prepared to have some issues because of the remote locations our parks are in, we loved our stay here and will be back. Vicki and Lisa at the front desk were awesome! Room Tip: The suites are SPECTACULAR room 5301"
POSITIVE,This was the second overnight stay on a five-day tour with 20 other Corvette owners. The staff was exceptionally good and even roped off a section of their parking area so we could keep our cars together and out of harms way.
POSITIVE,"The staff was very helpful. The room was spacious and well kept. We got a good signal for wireless connection. The bathrooms were nice. Breakfast was great. They had a really nice spread. Good value for the price of the room. Highly recommend this hotel. They were renovating the spa so we couldn't use it :( Room Tip: Can't hurt to ask for an upgrade, but I don't know if they have so many different types of rooms."
POSITIVE,"Our room was very comfortable except for the draft under the door. It got very, very cold, bring hats and mittens in October! The breakfast buffet was much more than I expected: fruit, sausage, pancakes or french toast, etc. An extremely comfortable, deep bath tub in a land of extreme water conservation. Could not in good conscience pour myself a large tubful. Good online rate. Would highly recommend."
POSITIVE,V
POSITIVE,"I've heard the term ""customer delight"" very often but I had the first hand personal experience of the same when I stayed with my family at Best Western Grand square inn on 26th November night. We had a request for a crib to be provided in the room for my 5 months old daughter and when there was a problem of providing the same the front desk attendant,Shelly was kind enough to upgrade us to a suite. We enjoyed the stay comfortably and the subsequent sumptuous breakfast too in the morning. After the check out in the morning we visited the Grand canyon and proceeded to Vegas . After traveling 3/4 of the way to Vegas, we realised to our dismay that we had left behind a backpack containing our laptop,ipad and other important items at the hotel itself. We contacted the hotel immediately and as it was late in the night the 'lost &found"" office was closed and we were asked to call the hotel next day morning. Next day morning we promptly called lost&found department of the hotel and after proper verification from us, to our great relief they confirmed that the backpack is in their safe custody. The next issue was shipping it to our place on the east coast.My husband discussed this with the hotel concierge,Chris and told him to ship the same by Fedex with insurance cover and charge us the shipping and insurance irrespective of the cost. But to our delight after ascertaining that we are going to be in Vegas for the next two days Chris intimated that he will air lift it to the air field at Boulder city which is 30mts drive from Vegas and we can pick it up from there on 28th.November noon. Accordingly we went to Boulder city airport on 28th afternoon and could collect our secured backpack with all the contents. For all the trouble taken to deliver our backpack safely we were not charged even a cent!! We can vouch on top of our voice that ""Best Western Grand Square Inn"" is really ""THE BEST""."
NEUTRAL,"This is a much larger Best Western than I have ever seen. There are lots of buildings. The place is brick so it is loud and cold. The rooms are very basic and the internet is terrible. The signal was ok but the internet connection was terrible. The buffet breakfast was like a cafeteria. Lots of people and wet eggs, burritos, sausage, fruit. It was fine for one night. There is a restaurant there and a nice gift shop."
POSITIVE,"I arrived at the hotel, to find across the road major noise from a building just beginning to be constucted. I was given around a room at the back of the hotel, and there was very little noise. The construction is to go on until the fall of 2013. There are only so many rooms at the back to go around. Location is great, comfort great, noise bad!"
POSITIVE,"After a long coast drive from southern California, I was expecting a generic motel stay. Wow, was I delighted by this property! We were given a room over the driveway, away from the rest of the rooms. What a beautiful room. The decor is Mexican, full of color and life, with dark furniture as contrast. Quiet room, and very spacious. The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful. I will definitely stay here if back in the area. Room Tip: Ask for the room over the driveway. Seems like it would be noisy, but not."
POSITIVE,"Hub and I chose this based on our past experiences with Best Western..the front desk clerk does not make eye contact ..he just goes on and books u in and takes your money or CC and doesn't even look at you...Our room was CLEAN .. wireless worked, but noticed there was no fridge or microwave,, went back and we were given another room..perfect EXCEPT there is NO FREE BREAKFAST,,, :-( would return to this place again."
POSITIVE,"- Location - Value for money - Comfortable and clean room - Corridor was smelly (maybe not surprising for a pet, i.e. dog-friendly hotel). Room was not affected. - Occasional barking (see above)"
NEUTRAL,"Hotel staff was very kind, room was clean and comfortable, and breakfast was delicious. It's in a bad neighborhood. I don't know if the security of the neighborhood is really bad or not, but it seems bad. Not to mention, there's few facilities that we can use such as restaurants or convenient stores. And I was hoping to stay little bit closer to Santa Barbara."
POSITIVE,We visited the Washington D.C. area with our 14 and 10 year old kids. This location was near subways and just a short walk from the main strip in Alexandria. But the best part was the free 24hrs snacks that were provided. My 14 yr old was walking down the hall every hour.
NEUTRAL,"I spent a little over a year staying at this hotel, about every 4-6 weeks. I had a brother in hospice nearby. I'll be honest, it wasn't the greatest but it fulfilled the need. Always seemed like there was a problem, tv didn't work, patio doors didn't open, fire alarm going off in the middle of the night for no reason, etc... Restaurant only has a minimal amount of food that is on the menu...great breakfast though! But it was clean and anytime there was a problem, usually taken care of right away. Staff is GREAT! It suited my need at the time."
NEUTRAL,Great breakfast and very friendly workers...nice overall stay...shuttle van drivers were very friendly and helpful... Ice machines on upper floors need to be fixed bad.....Shuttle service from airport to hotel had to be contacted....given 48 hours notice and never responded...
NEUTRAL,We needed a room with a fridge and micro due to our baby. Location was close to everything.
NEUTRAL,Stayed here for a meeting. Hotel staff friendly. Breakfast nothing special. CONSTANT problems with air conditioning ... rooms were very hot and after 3 days the problem was not solved. Location on highway so it was noisy to have windows open. Having no elevator was a problem for our group.
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the place on my way back from Orlando, FL. The rooms were very clean and staff was very helpful. THe price I got was cheaper as compared to not-so good hotels in Atlanta. Morning breakfast was fresh and room amenities were good. I would definitely recommend this place for stay.."
NEUTRAL,"Positives: great value, very clean, a very, very friendly staff, nice newly renovated modern rooms, great location a few steps from Earls Court station. Negatives: very small room (standard), tiny bathroom with toilet only 5 cm from wall, so to use it you have to sit sideways. Breakfastroom way too small if hotel is fully booked. Breakfast okay, but nothing special, coffee was terrible!"
NEGATIVE,"First of all, I wouldn't step on the carpet with my bare feet, it was disgusting. The shower head leaked and flooded the bathroom. The toilet had to be flushed atleast 2 times to get the smallest bit of toilet paper down. The air conditioner rattled all night. There wasn't even a trash bag in the trash can. And the only good place to eat was an applebee's up the road. Not directly off the interstate, deceiving pictures on website. Never stay there. EVER. Staff was nice, however. Only nice part about staying there but I was definitely ready to leave the next morning."
POSITIVE,"Room needed a littl maintainence, but bed very comfortable. Breakfast area is small, but adequate."
NEUTRAL,"A simple & quiet area , with a few eating places just blocks away . An average continental breakfast . Decent room & large bathroom . I travel alone so I cannot comment on other types of rooms . Grounds is ok , hotel located at end of street off state hwy . A little that that late night check-in is through a teller type window with thick glass . Used to face to face check-in . Makes you wonder about the area . Would stay there again , I had no problems ."
POSITIVE,I would recommend this Best Western. It's not fancy but clean and tidy. The free breakfast was great!!!
POSITIVE,I stayed at the Best Western Plus recently on a stop over through Toronto. The shuttle from the airport was timely and the staff very helpful when I called from the airport with both exact timing of when shuttle would arrive and the driver even waited for me due to a missing baggage claim that I unexpectedly had to make. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the stay was comfortable!
POSITIVE,"We stayed here on arrival in Toronto and then before flying out a few days later. The room was comfortable and clean and was typical for BW. However, there was no free breakfast which most BW's we have stayed in provide. The staff were friendly at check-in although the lobby decor is past its prime. The location is great for the airport with the shuttle - but otherwise its not good as quite an industrial and dull area. They have a pre-booking free shuttle to the airport so you know they will have space for you. However, to get from the airport it is best to call as the service is not that frequent and we waited quite a time. We went to eat dinner in the restaurant (and there were other diners there) but it looked untidy with tables not cleared and no-one came so after a few minutes we left. There are other restaurants within a short walking distance and we sampled two of them (one each night) - neither of which were more than basic. Hopefully, the BW restaurant is better than our impression."
POSITIVE,"Overall, I would stay here again. It is located in the Logan Downtown area. Close proximity to most things and was a decent price for the most part.Pros: Clean, comfortable and spacious. Good deal for the price. Cons: Front desk staff was rude and not very accommodating."
POSITIVE,"Husband and I stayed here on our recent trip to California wine country. We come from an area of the country in which Best Westerns do not have the best reputation, so I was a bit wary of making a reservation at this hotel. However, reviews were positive online and prices were reasonable, so we gave it a try. We were so glad we did!! This place is a really adorable gem in Napa. So quaint - more like a bed and breakfast. Innkeeper was so friendly and super helpful with meal suggestions and anything else we needed during our stay. Hotel is in great location - not in downtown Napa, but very close. Delicious breakfast included in stay, as well as fresh baked cookies and milk at 6 everyday. We were off on wine tours so didn't spend too much time at the hotel during the day to know whether it was quiet or it had activities for guests, but our room was huge and quite clean. We were in the apartment house out back, which appeared to only have stairs up to the second floor - just something to think about if you need elevator access - perhaps the main building has one. Had a nice, quiet night sleep and really enjoyed our time here. Would definitely stay here again and will recommend to others."
POSITIVE,"Pleasant experience. The hotel clerk was very nice and accomodating. Yes it is on a major road, however, we requested a room in the rear and had no problem with highway noise. This hotel is clean and efficient and amenities were excellent. There's a family restaurant across the street and the food was great. We would stay here anytime we're travelling in the area. Room Tip: A few miles off the major highway."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Elm House toward the end of October 2011. Tom, Connie and their excellent staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. Excellent breakfast items, particularly the fresh baked muffins and real Belgian waffles. On one evening, my wife and I had a little picnic in front of the fireplace with a fine bottle of wine we had purchased at a tasting and food items (cheeses, pate) purchased at the Sunshine market in St Helena. Located near downtown Napa, HWY 29 and the Silverado Trail. We will definintely return!"
POSITIVE,"Our room was a very large (almost like an apartment!) king-sized room with a walk-in closet that included an additional sink, vanity and mirror. Everything was extremely clean. Large flat panel TV with HD. The included breakfast was wonderful--the usual continental fare plus oatmeal with all the toppings, waffles made to order, freshly baked breads and fresh fruit. Everyone we met on the staff was kind and helpful. Room Tip: There was no elevator to our second floor room, so all luggage had to be hauled up 20 stairs."
NEUTRAL,"Breakfast room overfilled, tables dirty, and small buffet. The rooms must to be renovate. The elevator is very small for baggage of three persons."
POSITIVE,"The staff are very helpful and friendly, location is quiet and not much traffic. easy to get in and get out to and from freeway. will revisit in summer. Thanks"
NEGATIVE,"I booked our reservation at the Clock Tower resort using a link that included deals for water park passes to be included. In that link there was a King Loft room that I decided to book. When I confirmed my reservation a few days before our visit I was told that water park passes were NOT included. I explained that the link Best Western had provided in fact included admission to the water park. I was told that there was nothing they could do and that I needed to pay additional money if I wanted the room I reserved to include passes. I should have cancelled my weekend in Rockford and found another hotel chain willing to at least check into what I was telling them. Instead all I received from everybody, including your manager, was sorry we can't help you. False advertising is one of many things that come to mind. The Clock Tower has been advertising new renovations - the room I was given was exactly the same room I stayed in 20 years ago. I would wonder where these renovations where if I cared, but I don't. I was basicallly told everywhere I turned that I would just have to deal with what I got. It won't happen again. Not at the Clock Tower, not at any other Best Western hotel. There are plenty of places that cost far less for a night that include amenites far greater than what you're offering at what you are advertising as a ""resort"". It was a joke. I realize that the water park is not affiliated with Best Western but it should be said that the facilities at the water park were disappointing as well. Not worth driving from out of state - not even worth driving 5 minutes. My family travels frequently. Friends and relatives are always wondering where the best places for the value are. I will be sure to tell them that the Best Western chain of hotels is one to stay away from. Even after my husband emailed his concerns to your general manager, Alex Newman, we received a computer generated letter saying that he hopes we will consider staying again. WHY ?? Room Tip: Stay away from Best Western, especially the Clock Tower ""Resort""."
NEGATIVE,"we have stayed here for many years as its convenient and we enjoy eureka. we come thru every 3-4 months. this time however was a very different experience. we decided to stay three nights, very unusual for us, as our house is being renovated and we needed some quiet time. we thought we'd walk and come back in time to shower and go to a movie that started at 2:30.. imagine our surprise when we enter the shower to find it not cleaned from the last customer. we call twice before someone comes to clean the shower and then we rush to get to the movie ontime. not what we'd planned on. next day, we breakfast, walk, and decide to go to an noon movie, then shower when we return to the room at 2:30 we return to find our room not clean or made up. we have to leave again, find someplace to go while hopefully the room is being cleaned. we return at 3:30 to find it finally cleaned. is there no system for travelers staying more then one night to have attention in the am??? very disappointing for this motel."
POSITIVE,"My recent stay was great. I was impressed by the service provided. The moment I walked in, the front desk informed me that a water pipe had burst underneath the pool/spa building. So I was not able to use the pool or hot tub. Since the water was not working, I was offered water and snacks. They told me that they would keep me informed about the situation. They estimated it would take about 3 hours to get the pipe fixed. They called my room to keep me updated about the situation without me even needing to ask. Sure enough, they got the water running in 3 hours. Even though a pipe bursting is uncontrollable, the staff went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and taken care of. I consider that exemplary service. I had an awesome omlette when I woke up to eat at the breakfast bar. Plenty of food there. Minus not being able to use the pool and hot tub, my stay was very comfortable. The room was clean and nicely furnished and the staff were polite and accommodating. I will definitely be staying here again when I pass through."
NEGATIVE,"This Hotel is not well kept and is trashy inside and out. The ""Complementary"" Breakfast was unsanitary from everyone touching the food and the people in charge just watched it. They did absolutely nothing. Most People at the front desk were mean, and we were greeted by a rude ""Yes?"". For the room, our covers were placed inside out! The linens were not comfortable and the bed so-so. The toliet would flush on its own! We could not enjoy our stay here. For the dozens of other hotels out in this area, go somewhere else."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very clean, very quite and the staff were friendly and were always helpful with any questions. I would recommend if you go to Birmingham, AL stay here you will not be disappointed. Room Tip: Any room away from the elevator and away from the pool area is always quieter."
POSITIVE,"We pulled into this hotel at about 11:30 pm to find a place to sleep on a long drive to New Orleans. Because we were getting there later in the evening, the desk clerk knocked a few bucks off of the price. I didn't even have to ask! Rooms were clean and comfortable, and I slept very soundly. Breakfast was typical free breakfast fare, and fine. No gourmet foods, but quick, free, and convenient. If you need a place to crash for the night, this hotel will fit the bill very nicely. I'd stay there again. The service rating would have been higher if the desk clerk would have been able to find my Best Western Rewards membership number. Not sure if this was her fault or a system problem, but she couldn't find me."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for two nights while attending a near-by wedding. I was surprised at how nice the hotel is. Very clean, comfortable beds, quiet even though it is close to the Interstate, friendly staff."
POSITIVE,"What an enjoyable hotel!!! I stayed here for two nights during December with some family members. The staff is super-friendly, the prices were suitable, the continental breakfast was tasty, and the location was wonderful. Even though we traveled to Louisiana to visit New Orleans, this location was in a calmer part of the town, and it had all sorts of convenient locations surrounding it (ex. Winn Dixie, Walgreens, Waffle House, McDonald's, etc). We will DEFINITELY stay here again!"
POSITIVE,I have to say this was a great place to stay. Extremely clean and well kept. The staff was great-handled all requests asap. I am going to there again when I am in the area!!!
POSITIVE,"it was really a nice stay, the only thing was that it was a bit far from downtown but other than that we loved it. it was also pretty clean and breakfast was really good."
POSITIVE,"I originally posted a review on Oct 31, 2011 describing a poor customer service encounter I had while trying to redeem a certificate issued through a charity event. After posting that review I was contacted by the General Manager and she was very accommodating in re-issuing a new certificate. She apologized for the service I had in dealing with whomever had received my initial email as well as the follow-up phone call I had made. I do not know if the person with whom I initially dealt with is still at this facility, but if you have any problems I would recommend asking to speak with the General Manager as she truly worked to rectify the situation. I look forward to visiting their facility in 2012."
NEUTRAL,"The front desk staff went over and above the call of duty to make my stay wonderful. However, the breakfast was extremely unedible, with cold food and no one around to assist with explaining how to heat it."
POSITIVE,Hotel was very nice . Clean & Comfortable. Close to shopping & Dining. A must stay if your in the Plover or Stevens Point area. Room Tip: We stayed on the first floor. Was close to the dining & pool area if that important too you
NEGATIVE,"Stayed at this hotel for the Christmas break in 2011. Even considering this is the busy high demand season , this hotel was very overpriced when considering the room. Beds are small and they refused to let us put a cot in the room because we already had 2 beds. Internet is slow to the point of being useless. Room was average and at $49-$59 per night I would have been satisfied. Breakfast was ok. Advertised a free bus to parks which was nice to have but bus schedule was limited and made it very hard to fully enjoy the parks. Bus was late almost everyday as well. Rooms seemed clean enough so that was good. Lobby area was nice. My advice is use this as a second or third option. Only reason we stayed here is because we had best western gift cards."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at the Corte Madera Inn many times over the last few years while visiting family and friends, and I always come back. It is a throw back to the days when motels were actually fun. Big outdoor pool, beautiful garden, and friendly staff. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice relaxing place to stay. Room Tip: Don't get the last room on the end close to the freeway, its noisy. Other than that the rooms are quiet. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Location close to airport and shuttle service. Room was excellent as was the price.
POSITIVE,Everything was great and met our expectations for a hotel of this price.
POSITIVE,"I can't remember the last time I stayed in a Best Western -- I have assumed they are second tier hotels. But I just returned from a 4-day stay in Denton, TX, for business. The hotel was surprisingly modern and affordable, with outstanding service. Becca deserves special recognition for her friendly and helpful demeanor, making my colleagues and I feel comfortable, complete with recommendations for places to eat and insights into the local culture. She was at ease at the reception desk, and later at the bar. Her colleague, Tim, exhibited similar hospitality, sharing his talents at opera singing and driving us to a nearby restaurant. Thanks to the both of them!"
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed at the Best Western in Denton Texas and was pleasantly surprised. I have to admit it has been years since I have stayed at a Best Western and didn't realize that some were this nice. The lobby and reception area was spacious and clean. The rooms were above expected with vessel sinks, jetted showers, spacious closets and a nice kitchen area. The television was huge and I really like the suite feeling with couch separate from the bed. There were several restaurants within close walking distance and the daily breakfast had several hot items including an omelet station. This is a definite value for the money. I will definitely stay here on my next visit to Denton. My only complaint would be that the front desk staff person on duty at the time of my arrival was not very friendly or helpful. She was somewhat put out when we requested eating utensils for a quick meal purchased in the refreshment area of the lobby. I'm not quite sure how she expected us to eat these otherwise. The breakfast staff person however was very friendly and helpful."
POSITIVE,"My husband, my mother and I stayed here on Tues, Aug. 16 for one night. We arrived after 10 PM and the office left a packet with our room keys and brochures in a slot outside the front office. The room was nice, we had two queen beds (the beds were on the hard side), there was a table, 2 chairs, a refrigerator, tv, dresser. Separate area for the sink, the bathroom was clean, plenty of towels. The towels were soft, the shower itself had lots of hot water and the pressure was good. There was a coffee pot in the room, shampoo and conditioner as well. In the main office there was complimentary coffee and tea. Breakfast was offered in their restaurant which is attached to the hotel. We received a complimentary continental breakfast with our booking or you could purchase a full breakfast off the menu and you would receive 40% off the prices listed. The continental breakfast was sufficient for us. They offered eggs, oatmeal, cold cereal, bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, fruit. The menu prices for the a la carte breakfast were reasonable as well. The location of of the hotel is excellent, within walking distance to Kitchen Kettle, a shopping village as well as other shops. Very close to a lot of other attractions, buggy ride, tours, farmers markets. The price we paid for 3 adults was $125 inclusive of tax (that also was with a 10% senior discount) Overall we would not hesitate to stay here again."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed at this hotel in Nov. During my stay, an iPad worth about $500 was taken from my room. I reported it to a hotel staff member. He said he would leave a note for housekeeping. But I was repeatedly told there was not a manager present who could help me. No one was able to view the security cameras. No one was able to tell me which hotel staff had been able to access my room. I was given a # to contact a manager. I had to call him several times throughout the day before I got an answer. He simply told me, ""I'm sorry that happened. I won't be back until Tuesday."" I had to take the initiative to ask a hotel clerk to please write down my contact number so someone could help me. No one has called me. I know they may not be able to recover it but I I would like to know that there is a policy for dealing with stolen merchandise. The policy seems to be hotel workers have free reign to rooms with no accountability. If that is the case, I do not want to stay on Best Western Hotels again. I've never heard back from the hotel or the corporate office. I wish I had seen the other reviewer above who also had items stolen from this hotel. Clearly this is not a safe place to stay. Room Tip: Don't choose a room around 212, they claim there are no security cameras in this area."
NEUTRAL,"I ordered a King Jacuzzi suit; expecting a great room for the priceI had paid. The room was an average low priced MOTEL room, with a Jacuzzi. The jacuzzi was great; had lots of fun. But you can not just throw a jacuzzi in a room and call it a suite. I was very dissapointed in my stay; expecting a ""suite"" for $114.00 a night, and got a $50.00 a night ""TOPS"" room. I do not recommend this room, if you want a suite. Alarm clock did not work, all appliances were outdated, I did not even think they made 25"" box tv's anymore, and the operater never answerd the phone, so I could leave a wake up call."
POSITIVE,"we loved this place, the room was very clean and smelled wonderful, there were lots of towels and the bed was comfortable. There were laundry facilities for guests and the breakfast was great, it was served in its own room which is great as often there are in a hotel reception which can be a bit cramped but there was plenty of room and loads to chose from, including waffles! The pool was wonderful and in beautiful surroundings with a tiki bar, i highly recommend the margaritas! The check in staff were absolutely lovely and it was quick and easy. If we ever are lucky enough to go back to Key West I can't think of anywhere I'd rather stay."
NEUTRAL,reserved smoking and of course they did not have any available. Had to stay in a non smoking room. no discount and was informed if i smoked there would be a 250.00 to my card.
POSITIVE,Great place to stay near the airport. We flew in early morning. Staff was very nice and helpful. My mother liked the fact they had glass cups and glasses. Room was comfortable and very clean. I would stay here again to be near airport.
NEUTRAL,"Hotel was OK, but I felt that the office people have no clue how hard it is to travel with a small child. They put us in the only hotel room right by a door exit and it was way to noisy to get a nap in which made the trip a lot more difficult than it should have been.Pros: Good variety at the Continental breakfast. Cons: They new I was alone with a small child (2yrs) and they put me in a room right next to the door it was unsafe and loud."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Location, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,We checked in here because we were too tired to continue driving in the rain. I called the from the road and the manager was really nice about holding the room without a credit card because my wallet was in the trunk of the car. The room was nice and even had a fridge with a small freezer to store some of the food we had with us. We woke up to a beautiful view of the marshes behind the property. It wasn't cheap for a quick overnight stay ($150 for a room with two double beds) but it is a reasonable rate for a family who might want to use it as a base to explore the area.
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel multiple times while visiting our daughter who attends BSU. We have never had a bad experience staying here. The staff has always been very nice & helpful, good breakfast & clean rooms. It is our go-to hotel."
POSITIVE,"We had a 4 generation reunion. This hotel was perfect because the staff kindly gave us rooms near each other, and then we discovered that the architect cleverly designed the buildings so that they encircle the pool and playground. As a result we felt very safe having our grand children play there, much safer than if the playground/pool was next to the [?] street."
POSITIVE,"Given the favorable comments posted by others about the quality of the breakfast, it would have been nice of the hotel had warned everyone that the breakfast chef was not working on New Year's past weekend and the breakfast offered would be the kind of prepackaged fare one might pick up at a 24 hour convenience store. Telling everyone that they could [?] not remove any of the food from the eating area except their coffee cups seemed a bit tacky, especially since everyone had to give their name and room number when they entered. But it is a very nice facility, the staff was consistently courteous and attentive, the hotel itself was meticulously maintained, spotlessly clean and quite pleasantly decorated, and the price was right. I would not hesitate to recommend it."
NEUTRAL,"This motel was beautiful to look at. The lobby was very nice and clean guest friendly. The continental breakfast was very good variety of food and drink items. The staff was pleasant. The only reason I would not recommend this motel to friends or that I would not stay again is because the room was very dusty and dirty. The room itself was beautiful. Very nice furnishings. But, the dust, poorly vacuumed rooms, dirty mirrors, smell, etc. . . turned us off immediately. We needed to open the window and turn off the heater and turn on the fan and go for a walk to air out the room. When we came back it was somewhat better. So we closed the window and attached a dryer sheet to the vent of the fan and went out again. When we returned it was fresh smelling and did not burn our eyes. It is a shame that they do not have a better cleaning staff because this is a very beautiful motel. Pros: Continental Breakfast, nice furnishings, quiet Cons: Dirty Rooms, Dusty, Smelly Location: Location was excellent. Just off main drag."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was excellent as always, i always stay at this location. The visit was outstanding with the Morning buffet on the 20th of November. The waffle mix was empty and not refilled for at least 20 minutes in hopes that no one would make waffles so clean up could go faster, and the coffee was out at 0915 and never refilled since we stayed looking for [?] coffee. The person handling the buffet was not interested in the customers just in making sure everyone left before 10. I have stayed at this hotel at elast 6 times a year and have never had any issue like this before. I think there should be a little more service for the customers since we are not there just to sleep and have a nice breakfast before departing for our next destination."
POSITIVE,"I love this place for a few reasons: 1) The staff is very helpful and friendly 2) They have a parking garage with a very fair rate where you can leave your car for your stay as cabs and T-stations are both easily reached 3) If you are going to Fenway this place is awesome because it's only a few blocks from there. About 5 minutes by foot from the hotel And if nothing else, if you get hit by a car crossing the street this place is surrounded by hospitals. I will be honest in saying that if you are a couple looking for a romantic weekend away or something like that it probably would not be the first place I would recommend, but if you are just looking for a nice place to stay to travel as a family, visit someone in the hospital or hit Fenway for a game, this place is reasonably priced (for Boston) and a nice find! I will continue to stay here whenever I travel to the Boston area, thanks for another great stay!"
POSITIVE,"I stay in Boston with my daughter to attend the Boston Childrens Hospital. This is not only the most convenient, McDonalds IN the hotel, but they have a great staff. Jose is the highlght for my daughter. His big smile is a great thing to see when we have to be away from home for so long. We look forward to seeing Angel at the desk during the day, and Jenne in the evening! She knows where to get REAL alfredo sauce on REAL handmade macoroni! It is nice to be recognized 200 miles from home. We always enjoy our stay as well as the incredible staff. The same people everytime makes a big difference. They must really like where they work. Thank You for all your outstanding service, see you in 3 days! Room Tip: Upgrade to the Studio, well worth the small upgrade for the extra room"
NEUTRAL,"okay to stay due to proximity to airport, nice breakfast: but don't staff not very helpful. shuttle drivers very nice"
NEGATIVE,"Located in the middle of Old Town, but also Closely surrounded by super-freeways, a busy railroad, whistling by and a noisy airport greet you. Our room #403, ""reserved"", was overlooking their garbage collection facility/truck, which hissed and collecteded its items,early in the morning. Interrnet connection was very very marginal, to say the least, [?] and it was known at the desk. The Hotel was not over booked. I think our room was reserved for us, because, may be, we had a ""discounted"" room. The breakfast and garage facilities are extra and not cheap!."
POSITIVE,"Great location, and reasonably priced for thanks giving week. We would use again."
NEGATIVE,"The pictures definitely sold me on this stay. The rooms were pretty dirty, including beer bottle caps at the foot of the bed. The corners of the walls were dusty and the bathroom was not too clean. I should have first mentioned the room had a musky, smokey smell to it. I did order a non-smoking room. The area felt like in between truck stops and was [?] not placed too well. It was a disappointing and, frankly, embarrassing stay for my work crew."
POSITIVE,"Spacious and pleasant room, good breakfast, friendly staff"
POSITIVE,"I was travelling through toronto airport, and this hotel had a create price and convienent location. Rooms were clean and well appointed"
NEUTRAL,"The hotel itself is OK. I would have liked to know about the Legionella problem before I booked. I would not have stayed there if I had known. I don't want to risk my children getting sick. We were only informed as we were checking in late after a long drive, and I felt I had no option but to stay."
POSITIVE,"Swimming pool Room size, price Lumpy mattress On the outside of town. You need a car to get around Nice hotel. Exacvtly what you would expect. Lumpy mattress Nice pool. Reasonable price. No shuttle to down town"
POSITIVE,"Arriving late on my birthday, we were looking for something affordable but special and this hotel fit the bill perfectly. The room was quiet, elegant and spacious, and had lovely wall art, a gas fireplace, jacuzzi, large flat-screen TV, and an extremely comfortable king-size bed. The staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The breakfast buffet the next day was ample and was included in the cost of the room. Given our delightful experience, we recommend that the hotel increase the visibility of the street signage to make this wonderful place easier to find!"
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel from Monday January 30th through Saturday February 4th. The hotel is very clean and staff very nice and helpful. I stayed in the Lanza room on the fourth floor. The bed was very comfortable and the flat screen tv was nice with several HD chanels. I enjoyed the rainfall shower head and the open shower. The only negatives I had was limited parking and the breakfast buffet. When we arrived Monday evening parking was scarce due to Chicago having a concert next door (had I known this I may have purchased a ticket). Parking was difficult later in the week as there was another show by a different group. It might be a good idea to check the schedule as there are many good acts advertised. The breakfast bar was ok for a one night stay. But every morning was the same; scrambled eggs on wax paper, fried potatoes, bacon, and some kind of sausage. They also had cereal, toast, yogurt, coffee and juice. On all mornings but the last they had muffins. A little variety or offering oatmeal or waffle station would be a great addition. I must complement the hostess who was very pleasant each morning. I will stay at this hotel for my future trips."
POSITIVE,Nice hotel with friendly staff. Resturants within walking distance.
POSITIVE,lovely clean hotel. very helpful staff. out of the way but quiet area. about an hour drive from washington dc. the pool and hot tub were very nice. nicely heated and a good large size. after 9.00 i had the pool to myself. the breakfast was plentyful with hot and cold choices. very comfortable beds. we were out most days so didnt try the bar/restaurant next door. we would stay here again. Room Tip: try to get a gound floor room so you dont have to mess around with the lift
POSITIVE,My grandson and I stayed at this facility and were very happy with everything. He enjoyed the pool and the breakfast was wonderful. We had to pick up his Mom coming back from serving in the Middle East so the convenience of the hotel to airport was very nice.
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Our room was in the annex and while the room was clean and basically roomy, the beds were horrible (2 double). The mattresses definitely need to be replaced. Our bathroom was really really small, but it was clean. It is in a convenient location and the continental breakfast was really good."
POSITIVE,"Just stayed 3 nights at the Best Western Revere in Paradise, PA and as usual, enjoyed every minute of the stay. Located in the heart of all the major attractions in Lancaster County, yet it is situated a bit off busy Route 30, resulting in a very quiet facility. We have stayed at this Hotel between 20 and 30 times over the years and have never been disappointed. We are always greeted pleasantly by everyone from the front desk personnel, maid service and even the maintenance man. Rooms in the main building are spacious, clean, and provide for a most comfortable stay. An excellent continental breakfast is complimentary. An indoor and outdoor pool are provided making it an ideal place for families. We usually make at least 2 trips each year to the Lancaster area and always try to book our room at the Revere. Always try to book ahead as they are very busy during summer and fall months. We highly recommend the Revere for business or family trips."
NEGATIVE,"We just spent one night here and that was enough..the hotel has seen better days. It was run-down, dirty in the common areas, extremely thin walls which didn't help with the TV next door and the screaming students outside in the pool area. We were surprised it was open till 10.45. The room was supposed to be no-smoking but stank of tobacco. The location was good and freeway access good and helpful staff but we would not recommend this hotel. Room Tip: don't take a room with adjoining door See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,Problems we experienced: - 2 broken vending machines - ice machines out of ice on 2 floors - air conditioning was broken in the lobby for at least 2 days - hallways had weird incense/air freshener smell - ashtrays and trash cans at the outside entrance to the lobby were overflowing with butts and trash - hallways are noisy - carpets in the lobby were not vacuumed daily
NEGATIVE,"The hotel itself is in a good location, but for the $190 a night I am paying, just not worth it. The rooms were updated years and years ago. The restaurant, like the exercise room, doesn't open till 7AM. And to make matters even worse, the exercise room is located on the only smoking floor. I used to smoke and have no problems with ""smokers"", but do I have to smell it (heavily) while I work out? And their reason for why they don't open the exercise room till 7? Too much noise. Yet it doesn't seem to bother them that their ice makers sound like mini lear jets trying to take off! I can hear it 8 rooms away. I also had to call down to get the wireless connection code. I called four times, each letting it ring 20 times or so. Finally I went down to the front desk. Surprise, two people standing there. One finishing up with a customer. I asked why she couldn't have picked up the phone (which was ringing again) and say ""front desk, please hold"". She seemed shocked that I would expect such customer service. I also NEVER took my socks off, which should tell you how dirty the room is, yuk! Skip this hotel! I found another independent hotel one block away, next time that is where our staff stays. Room Tip: Stay elsewhere"
POSITIVE,"The convenience of the shuttle to the Metro system was superb. It made our stay in Washington D.C. area pleasant. Our goal was to see the National Mall. We did not allow enough time, so we will return sometime. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"The place was good, the pool was good, and the morning breakfast, while laid out in a confusing style, was quite tasty and edible. For people who want a good, no frills place to stay, this will work."
NEGATIVE,"Boy did I make a mistake booking this motel. The rate for 4 nights was not cheap so I expected more. The parking outside the room was already occupied so we couldn't park in front of the room, the door was warped, upon entering the room the smell of mildew and cigarette smoke was overwhelming and it was a non smoking room. The carpet was filthy and [?] should have been removed vs cleaned, there was a sliding glass door with ratty curtains which did not provide security for my belongings when I wasn't occupying the room. Would not want to stay there for any length of time because of the smell so we would have to opt to leave our belongings in the car. The bed was not comfortable to sit on as the mattress was of poor quality. In the bathroom the toilet smelled and the bolt caps were on the floor and the towels looked like my grandmother's mix and match towels vs a quality hotel. We tried going to the store across the street and purchased candles and lysol, but that did not help. Needless to say we checked out the same day we checked in. Cannot comment on the free breakfast, wi-fi, cable television - the only positive thing was the microwave and small fridge were clean. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Very old and needs an upgrade very badly."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I and little dog stayed one night. We found the staff friendly, the room clean and spacious - the bed very comfortable and the hotel itself very close to the strip. Plenty of surrounding area to walk the dog also. Breakfast was very good also. I enjoyed the waffles. We will stay there again."
POSITIVE,"The price was great, the location was fabulous. The rooms have been recently redone and the beds are super comfy! The breakfast was also a great perk. We used this to stay near the local high school and it was the perfect distance."
NEUTRAL,"We spent one night midweek at this hotel. Check-in was efficient and I was pleased to find that they had taken on board my request for a quiet room, though with no wedding parties/large groups, the hotel was fairly quiet anyway. Hence no trouble in finding a parking space. Our room was comfortable and well appointed and everything worked. I asked for extra pillows, which three hours later had still not arrived, but these were quickly supplied when I made a second call to reception. The bar service when we went for our pre-dinner drink was ""interesting."" The bar was quiet and I was the only person waiting to be served. The bar person excused himself and kept his back to me whilst he played with a pen and paper for a few minutes. He then excused himself again and left the bar altogether for a few more minutes. I felt that this was rather contemptuous and rude- it would have taken him only a couple of minutes to serve me with our drinks. Our evening meal, which we chose from a fairly uninspiring menu was ""average"". Breakfast did seem a little chaotic, but we did manage to get most of what we ordered. Even with only two of us at the table I seemed to be continually playing chess with crockery, tea pots etc to make room on the table. Breakfast was acceptable if you can live with dried-out black pudding, watery scrambled egg and wafer thin hash browns. The sausages were a redeeming feature- very meaty and tasy. Checking-out was dealt with pleasantly and efficiently and our bill was spot on. Overall, we did quite a good deal and didn't leave unhappy- only slightly disappointed with the food. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the road."
NEGATIVE,"Heater was not working and we slept in our coats. Headboard fell off the wall, toilet didn't flush properly and sheets were too small for the bed and kept coming off the corners. Pros: Proximity to Legoland Cons: Room upkeep and temperature Location: Excellent for visiting Legoland...close enough to walk."
NEUTRAL,"Good place for a good price. No bells or whistles, an affordable place. There are better places in town, but you will spend the $$ for them."
POSITIVE,Our suite was spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very friendly. The downs are the lack of view because the hotel only has 9 floors and the extremely small size of the lobby which does not make it welcoming especially if you arrive when people are checking out.
POSITIVE,"Stayed in a Tuscan room and it was very nicely decorated and had a jacuzzi tub. I understand that rates go up drastically during high season, but in the off season this was a real deal. My only complaint was that the in room heater/air conditioner remote was difficult to figure out and the unit had a disturbing grinding noise that came on after about 5 minutes. After turning it on and off a couple of times it quieted down and I could get back to sleep. Beautiful rooms, hot tub and pool."
NEGATIVE,I would have to say that this hotel was well below our standards. It is the lowest rated we have ever given to a place we have stayed. I'm quite suprised that it keeps it's Best Western affiliation. I would not recommend this place for anyone else.
POSITIVE,"The room was comfortable and functional. The only thing that was not comfortable was the easy chair. However, we weren't in the room that much so it didn't impact our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was plentiful and had good variety. The location was great. Thanks!"
POSITIVE,"Excellent. Clean, quiet, helpful staff. Good breakfast. I would go out of my way to stay here again, reasonable price."
POSITIVE,"We've been coming to Ouray since the early 1970's, and have always enjoyed our stays here at the Twin Peaks. This time, we REALLY needed this vacation with our grandchildren, and we are having a wonderful time. We are still staying at the Twin Peaks as a review it, but I felt compelled to let TA know how well this hotel is trying to please the clientele. The front desk is very attentive and trying hard to please. There is a chef and co-chef here now since we last stayed, Guido and Donna, who prepare a wonderful breakfast made to order! This morning, we had custom western omelets that were fantastic! Our grandsons enjoyed the scrambled eggs (very light and tasty) along with belgian waffles freshly made with hot maple syrup and hot butter poured on top. Guido came by the table to check on us and delivered fresh strawberries to those who wanted them. You gotta stay here if you can...only negative at this moment is the pool at lunchtime needed to be skimmed and they were doing some work around the pool. But this was a minor thing and we are enjoying our stay very much! Room Tip: Ask about best pricing on rooms...they have some suites that are roomier and offer more amenities."
POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed our stay! The hotel was great, the pool was amazing and the chef and his sweet wife make a mean breakfast! Room Tip: We are a family of six and our room had 2 double beds and bunk beds too - that was a great option! See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately if you need a hotel in Owen Sound this is a good as it gets. Fitness ""room"" is non-existent...a few cardio machines stuck in the corner of hotel. Need a ""key"" for treadmill...total pain and then if anyone else needs it you have to return it to the front desk first. Restaurant and ""included"" breakfast very tired and plain. Not bad for the [?] area but not great!"
POSITIVE,"After a lot of research we booked this hotel as we were had no transport in San Diego other than public transport and it worked out great, the transport links to downtown a d sea world work perfect and we had a full week in San Diego. The hotel itself worked out well with the fridge and coffee making facilities and free water and free Internet in the lobby. Mixed emotions on the front of staff some were super helpful others were so so, but hey a mixed bag is the best thing i can say. They did facilitate a room change easily enough and so that was positive. I think it's great hotel for families as it's reasonable price and the fridge means you guys can stock up and eat when you want. As for the breakfast well it's not worth the money, hmm I only went once and then just bought food and put it in the fridge, my husband went back every day, just not my cup of tea. The wine tasting seemed popular and coffee in the mornin was good. The laundry facilities are way back at the back of the complex and I didn't feel comfortable going there alone once it got dark but it all worked fine another good thing if you were bring a family here. Internet facilities were good and it did not take me too long to find promotion codes for discount in sea world and if it doesn't work online call them with the code and they will help you and email you on the ticket, saved nearly 50 dollars so worth the bit of research think. Rooms were clean , old fashion decor , and old fashion bathroom suite but wouldn't put me off coming back!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel spreads up the hill in Old Town and is steps from all its attractions. Finding your room can be a bit of a challenge at first but once found you now have time to wander around all the little terraces with their surprise fountains and small gardens. The rooms are large with flat screen tvs and microwaves, but do not expect very modern furniture. The 3 computers in the lobby are a welcome addition to the facilities. This is a great hotel from which to start a tour of san Diego, the trolley starts just a short walk through the car park. There are lots of reasonable eating places in old Town and there is also a Mexican type restaurant at the hotel. We loved the quirkiness of this hotel and its position."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed there the past two years and enjoyed it very much. The staff are fantastic, and the cleaners are amazing-the rooms were always spotless when we returned, with fresh towels, facecloths, etc. Excellent location. Nice View. Pool was excellent and the hot tubs are a favorite of mine! The restaurant has some fantastic tasting, healthy food. Very comfortable beds. Very tourist friendly-the workers at the front desk were very helpful... There is a flat screen television, a safe you may use with no extra charge, and an area where you can use computers/internet. Very good prices as well. Will return without a doubt!"
NEUTRAL,"For our third night on the road from NYC to Naples with our dog (which limits our choices) we reserved a suite at this hotel. It was to have a king sized bed, a couch and a desk. After all, this was New Year's Eve and we wanted to upgrade from our other stops on the road. We were given a small, dark room with just a bed. The person in the room we had reserved didn't check out and the hotel had no intention of asking him/her to vacate the room. They did accommodate us with a lower rate and a slightly nicer room. Just beware that what you reserve may not be what you get!"
POSITIVE,"The breakfast and the beds and pillows. The entrance drive to go in an register was too small for the volume of cars. Easy to find, right at an intersection. Enjoyed the room and the complimentary breakfast and newspaper were an extra treat. Not just a donut, but a menu to choose from. Very nice and they allow pets."
POSITIVE,"The motel is right across the street from the Alaska Ferry and about 1.5 miles from downtown, but they have a shuttle that is very helpful and almost always available. The hotel itself was very compfortable, though the pillows need a little work - but I am picky! The star of the stay was the restaurant! GREAT dinner with very reasonable prices and a very good breakfast. There are a lot of locals that eat hear and everyone goes away smiling. My partner also really appreciated the number of beers on tap. The price was high for the room, but I would definitely stay there again. Room Tip: There are lots of stairs, though there is an elevator if you go outside."
NEUTRAL,The title of this hotel has airpot but to get there you have to take 2 different highways and travel another 0 mintutes down 107 which is a bust city strret. In traffic it is 30 minutes. It cost me 37.00 for a CAB. The name and the map made it looks closer. Do more research.
POSITIVE,"Close to Interstate with all the major amenities. Excellent hot breakfast with multiple choices of items. Clean rooms and a large gathering area that can be with our outside the pool area. Nice for families to gather or groups to gather. Pool had late evening adult only hours which was also nice for winding down without lots of noise, activity going on. Pros: Nice pool and hot tub with hours for families and for adults only. Great complementary breakfast."
NEUTRAL,"Pleasent service from restaurent staff, even though it was late at night. As a new customer, I was not aware that I had to call the shuttle. There could be a reminder to customers to call the shuttle and it should be a 1-800 number."
POSITIVE,would like to return this summer thank you for a pleasant stay
POSITIVE,"nice hotel, pool was nice and cool, weather was stinking hot, air cond worked well, location of ice machine was great, breakfast was really good"
POSITIVE,"One of the top two or three BW hotels I've stayed at in the last five years: clean, quiet and comfortable; incredibly caring and attentive staff; complementary breakfast well above average for BW's; well-tended pool and hot tub in a center court atrium. Location puts you within walking distance of narrow gauge railroad station, some great restaurants and shops. Reviewer who called staff ""unhelpful"" didn't meet the people I did. One carried my bags up three flights of stairs because elevator was out for a 30 minute repair! I'll be back."
POSITIVE,"As always, this hotel chain has provided quality for the price. Free parking, free continental breakfast, free WiFi, quick check in and clean rooms. The only draw back for us were the beds. They were hard as rocks and not very comfortable."
POSITIVE,"We stayed one night and were very pleased with our choice. The hotel was close to the highway but not so close that we had to listen to traffic. The room was clean, and comfortable. The breakfast was one of the better buffets - lots of choices, including whole wheat English muffins and sugar free syrups and jams. The room was full but one of thew staff kindly showed us to another room where we could sit. My only complaint is actually one that apples to most hotels these days, i.e. the beds are too soft"
POSITIVE,"The free breakast + the very nice staff. Taxis apparently don't come to this hotel... I waited for a cab for 20 minutes (the cab place kept saying they would be at the hotel in 5 minutes)... Whole Food 2 minutes away and open until 10pm. daily! I liked the hotel, especially its price and its free breakfast (bread, muffins, waffles, fruit... and there is still a lot to eat even 5 minutes before the end)! The location was very good -- it took 10-15 minutes to walk to the convention center/ downtown. However, a few blocks are VERY empty and dark (as a woman traveling alone, one night I took a cab from downtown and it only cost less than $5). The room was big (not too fancy but had everything it needed), the pillows not very comfortable but the bed was. I liked that was there was an empty fridge and a microwave in the room. One thing: I could hear the cars (my window was facing 8th avenue) -- it didn't prevent me from sleeping, but if you need complete silence to be able to sleep, this may be problematic."
POSITIVE,We were on our way to Michigans upper peninsula and on our way decided to spend a day in Frankenmuth. Spent the night at this Best Western. My wife liked all the flowers in bloom on the exterior. The room was clean and they had an adequate complimentary breakfast. If I come to this area again I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"We were honestly worried about even staying in Billings after reading some of the TA reviews. I felt obliged to write my first review to ease concerns of other travelers. We decided on this Best Western and were relieved when we got here. Great service at the desk, incredibly clean room (including the hygienic TV remote) and a comfortable bed. Only $79 on a Friday night after a long day of driving made it a deal, too. Our first time in a Best Western and we would definitely stay here again if travels bring us this way in the future."
POSITIVE,"One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. Beds were super comfy, good price and helpful staff. Located right off interstate and easy to find. 10% off dinner at Juicy's which is right next door to hotel. Food was very good. Portions huge, great bloody mary! That's where you have breakfast the next day. The ""free"" breakfast is limited to 2 choices though - either cereal or a huge plate of scrambled eggs & ham with potatoes and a drink. If you want to order off the menu, they give you 20% off."
POSITIVE,"I've been to this area a half a dozen times and thought I'd give this hotel a try. I really liked it. It's located right across from the harbor and within walking distance to several great restaurants. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms are a little dated but clean. The beds are firm but not back breaking firm. Breakfast was adequate: hard boil eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal and waffles. I've stayed several times at the Best Western plus Avita Suites in Torrance and would choose this hotel over that one. It's a better location, a little less costly, and doesn't have that awful deodorizer pumped through the hotel."
POSITIVE,"Lovely rooms, comfy beds and nice breakfast. Great airport location and close to shopping malls."
POSITIVE,"Rooms are pretty small. The bathrom could use a few hooks to get undressed, hang towels etc... But the confort is good. The grounds are very good ( pool, yard, pnig pong table ) and the complementary breakfast is the very best I ever had in this king of mid-priced hotel. Free internet and free dvd movies out of a list of over 300 movies. Great coffee machine ( espresso, mocha etc...) available 24 hours a day. Calm environment and well placed to UCSB. The only soso thing was that I was directed ( without an actual map ) to the very back of the hotel for my room...while it was halfway on the side. I lost 10 minutes. But overall, a very good place and this is where I would try to go everytime I need to stay in Goleta."
POSITIVE,"Stayed one night on a business trip and satisfied with this motel. I was in a room with a partial ocean view on the fourth floor looking North. The room was quiet,view was good my only complaint would be the room had a smell like new carpet or just cleaned carpet. The hallways are interior but yet open to the outside elements"
NEUTRAL,"Clean and comfortable room with nice beds and bedding. Good wi-fi and very easy to use. Breakfast was satisfactory. Easy access to freeways, shopping and restaurants. In nice condition for an older property."
POSITIVE,"After a long, tedious day of driving from South Orange County to the San Jose area on I-5, we somehow found ourselves at a good stopping point in Gilroy, the Garlic Capital of the World. While there are a few inns near the acres-long and -wide outlet mall across the highway, we stayed at the Best Western Forest Park Inn, closer to what would be the older part of downtown Gilroy. By 7 p.m., we were hungry and minivan-happy, and this Best Western looked like the place to unwind. We unpacked and stretched out on the clean beds with the bedspreads folded down while my 12-year-old performed her bedbug inspection routine. It passed! We ambled over to the restaurant on the premises, the Black Bear Diner, for home-cooked pot roast and tilapia, We ended up staying another night, because the location was close to San Jose, and Gilroy is quiet and lowkey. The inn's breakfast was better than most I've had at Best Westerns, with fresh fruits, eggs, waffles, and muffins and breads that tasted like they came from a local bakery and not from a Little Debbie box. Everything was clean and quiet, and the front desk service was especially helpful with directions into San Jose and Santa Clara, even providing a Google Maps printout. Would I return? Certainly. My kids loved the koi pond and bridge just outside the front office. And on our first evening, when I stepped out of the minivan, a wind kicked up the scent of fresh garlic from local fields. For garlic lovers - that's a heavenly aroma. Room Tip: To ensure a quiet stay, choose a unit toward the back of the property and away from the elevator."
POSITIVE,"the room was a bit dated but very clean, (aside from the yellow stained shower curtian) the hotel staff was friendly professional and very helpful. the hotel is located on a busy road but I didnt find my room on backside to be too noisy. this hotel is not fancy but it has what you need for a budget stay, the breakfast is well done and the gym equipment [?] and sauna work suprisingly well"
NEUTRAL,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly. The view to Louisiana bridge was very good. It's a little tricky to navigate but it was good ""none the less"" Make sure you call the hotel first for an alternative address the 10 Grand Soleil Boulevard did not show up in my GPS. It's a nice hotel."
POSITIVE,I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel. This was an excellent hotel. The views were magnificent. The room was an excelelnt value and clean and well appointed.The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I look forward to another visit at this hotel.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is located just north of downtown napa. Great central location for wine tasting in Sonoma, Napa, and to the Calistoga area. The hotel service was courteous and helpful. The room was clean and with ample room. The fridge was located in a cabinet. Only the bottom of the fridge was able to keep food and drinks cold. Although, audio and video [?] connections were available for the room...the Ipod clock connection didn't work. Overall, this was a good hotel and I would recommend it to friends."
POSITIVE,"Location Mattress The location wasnt downtown but was close to the river and hiking, which is where we wanted to be. Recently spent the weekend in Mountain View for a trail race. Room was in good condition-only complaint was mattress was very uncomfortable (seemed worn out). Other than that room was what you would expect for the price. Clean, quiet, and the staff was helpful. I've stayed in hotel two other times without a complaint so maybe I just got the one bad mattress this time!"
NEGATIVE,"Whilst the location was convenient the overall cleanliness wasn't the bees knees. First thing we saw when we entered the room was a roach crawling across the table provided. It didn't take but a second to notice the stench of tobacco in our nostrils even tho we asked for a non-smoking room. We also noticed pubes in the shower and on the blow drier. The bathroom was clearly not properly sanitized because of the brown smudge above the toilet paper roll. Though it was a place to lay our weary heads, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my friends, family or strangers."
NEUTRAL,"I stayed here since it was close to East Baltimore. The location looks dingy and dirty on the outside, but the rooms are clean, the restaurant is fairly good, and the staff tries. However, both times I tried to check in, the disorganization of the front desk caused me to wait 10 minutes the first time and again 20 minutes the 2nd time I stayed at the [?] hotel. They tried to be professional and polite, but it was obvious that this hotel can stand some improvement. The breakfast buffet is a microwave select of scrambled eggs, waffles, sausage, breads, cereal and juices. Not the best in the morning, but included in your room rate. Also, the first wake-up call I received jolted me from bed when the computer stated it was 9:56 am not 7:30 am. After realizing that it was 7:30am and not 10am, I calmed down. This seems to be a good way to understand this hotel. They get the major things right, but the minor items seem to fall through the cracks. If you need a cheaper place to stay, Best Western Conference Center is fine, but do not expect it to be everything you hoped for in a hotel."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is dated but the friendly management has installed granite coutertops, minifridge, coffee machine, comfortable & clean beds and wall mounted hair dryer. The building is a welcoming courtyard configuration with an aviary of happy parakeets, calming fountain, large chess set & inviting seating all around the well maiintained pool. Also free wi-fi and computer access in ""business center"". We didn't get that at the $200+/night on the other side of town! Will definately book another stay at this Best Western when in town!"
NEUTRAL,"Despite pre booking a crib when we booked this and also requested adjoining or adjacent rooms, the reception team didn't know about this and with a tired baby this was not a great start. Apart from the noise of being on a freeway ( that's what it felt like) the breakfast and service was excellent. Best Western really let me down this time."
POSITIVE,"The rooms were a little tight, could have used some updating but they were neat and clean. Also, the air conditioning made a clattering noise so we could not crank it up as high as my husband would have liked. One bed was right up against the sliding glass doors and we kept bumping in to each other with four pieces of luggage and not much walking room.Â It was literally right up the street from the airport and that is why we chose this location, but we didn't really hear much air traffic above. What was surprising is that it had free Wi-Fi because I had stayed in a mch more expensive hotel during this trip and there was an exorbtant charge to use it."
POSITIVE,"As usual, after making the mistake of reading customer reviews I'm always hesitant about using a new hotel.... you ALWAYS find one crummy review which knocks you off guard!!Any bad stuff about this hotel... well I didn't see it. The room especially was of an exceptional high standard. The bed (King Size) was huge and the room itself was very plush for what I'm thinking is a budget hotel.They have a great bar here with good prices and snacks and the breakfast each morning is very welcomed. Plus you get Free Parking and Free Internet access to those not using laptops and Wi Fi.The staff we came across were friendly and helpful.The only downside to this hotel if anything is location. Other than a few basic shops, a CVS Pharmacy, McDonalds and a Starbucks there's not really anything you can walk to. You will need a car or have a hefty budget for taxis. BUT, if you do have a car (and to be honest, if you're in Dallas then you should have) then this hotel is perfect. There are a tonne of restuarants literally minutes drive away and the hotel is situated right next to the highway so you're maybe ten / fifteen minutes from downtown and the various malls.Should we return to Dallas... and we do plan to, then I'd have no hesitation in booking this hotel again."
POSITIVE,A pleasant place to stay when visiting our student. Staff was very gracious and the premises were clean and comfortable.
NEUTRAL,"ALL the employees were just going through the motians of being friendly, when trying to start a friendly conversation they either don't understand English or look at us with disgust."
POSITIVE,Very good breakfast. Large room. Laundry facilities. Hot apple cider when you get back from a road trip! Friendly and efficient staff.
NEUTRAL,"We have stayed at the Best Western Yosemite Gateway Inn several times over the past twenty years. We always stay in a two room family suite and have found it to be clean and comfortable for a night or two on the way to Bass Lake or Yosemite. The hotel staff are friendly and always accommodate our family and Newfoundland dogs. The family suites have a small 'kitchen' with refrigerator and microwave, a patio or deck and enough room to find a bit of privacy. For the price, this Best Western is hard to beat if Oakhurst is your layover point. I agree with other reviewers, the restaurant is terrible. The customer service is so bad the quality of the food is superfluous. I can't imagine it is still open."
POSITIVE,"My two friends and I are from England, and had come to California to visit Yosemite National Park. Our first impression of the hotel was great, from the carved bear at the entrance to the stunning lodge style foyer. The rooms didn't disappoint and were set out like a village in the woods which was a great surprise from the usual boring chain type hotels. Clean and quiet rooms with all the usual amenities. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and was sad to leave. Would DEFINITELY stay here again."

NEGATIVE,"Summer -- air conditioning in hotel is questionable. The property is run down. However, it's a much better than the value hotel next door -- which has bed bugs. Room Tip: There are better choices in the LaPorte area See more room tips"
POSITIVE,I just stayed here for biz having chosen this hotel through a package deal. AWESOME great value super clean and friendly. The location is perfect! I've found my place to feel at home doing biz in LA. And I can b very picky!
POSITIVE,Good value. Looked at other hotels on internet that were priced lower but after looking at pictures and guest reviews decided it was better to pay a bit more for a better hotel. The manager was very pleasant and interested that the guests were having a good stay. Already recommended hotel to others. Did you find this review helpful? yes no
POSITIVE,Clean and comfortable room. Very nice breakfast area. Roomy pool area. Very close to the mall and a variety of restaurants.
POSITIVE,This was the 2nd stop on our honeymoon and the hotel staff was great and knew the city and short cuts. The room was clean and very spacious for a suite room. The colors and bathroom could use updating.Pros: Front desk gave perfect directions as we never got lost with there directions. Cons: For an indoor heated pool the pool was ice cold
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here on two separate occasions. Both times we have had a king suite room with a pull-out sofa. The first time was during a two-night shopping trip and, most recently, enroute home from a vacation. The rooms were a reasonable size, the beds were very comfortable and the microwave and refrigerator worked well. My adult daughter noted that the pull-out sofa was very comfortable. A good mattress made for a good night's sleep. The room lighting seems dark due to the fact that the only window looks out onto the enclosed corridor. It looks as if the rooms were once reached by an external corridor and now that corridor has been enclosed to create inside walk-ways. The shower stall (there was no tub) was akward to use. It is hard to explain the configuration. Again, this was probably a renovation project. The shower reminded us of a locker-room shower. THAT makes us wonder where the PLUS comes from in this hotel's status. As we were on our way home from vacation, having had several different hotel's continental breakfasts, we definately felt that the offered breakfast was adequate and tasty. Nothing overly special or surprising but a good variety of food items was available. All in all, we would stay at this hotel again when in the area."
NEUTRAL,"The room was average at best, and it was pretty noisy, but if you're visiting Legoland, it's a great place to stay. If you get a room on the inside (we didn't) it would probably be better."
POSITIVE,The hotel was fine with the service. i was very disapointed at the size of our room based on the price we paid. I expected a larger room with a balcony or patio and received neither. Also the bed was very hard and gave me a backache.
POSITIVE,It is located near the lake and good view from the room and around a mile from famous Gondola rides. The only issue we had was that the room does not have microwave and we have to go to the common kitchen area out side of the room in the chilling cold to get hot water for my baby. Over all it was nice staying there.
NEGATIVE,"I was planning on staying for 7 days to attend a class -First off it wasn't for the lady at the front desk I would have left after walking in to the room. They asked if it was ok to move me to the front of the building because it is closer to the parking lot...not that big of an issue. She was extremely friendly and warned me that room didn't have a Fridge or a micro and will be able to get a fridge the next day but wasn't sure when the micro was going to be in. That wouldnât have been an issue till the next day when I would have gotten back. -Second once in the room the room was blazing hot, the hanging rack near the sink for your hanging cloths was about to fall of the wall. If my son was with me at this time Iâd be afraid that it may fall off the wall. I had found 2 unknown poles sticking out of the underside of the bed to the inside of the walk are between the two beds. I had brushes my leg against them twice since I had been there. -Third the after looking around the room I had found that the bathroom was almost as bad as a High School gym shower after the football team has been in it. There was a hair on the side wall and a pubic hair on the back wall. To top it off the room service didnât even bother to get someoneâs bar of used soap on the rail. -Fourth the internet serviced sucked. It only worked for after spending 30-45 minutes to get in to connect and only worked for about 2-3hours before the connection was shut down. -Fifth was a warning from the front desk that the phone service was messing up. It turns out that several people have called to complain about the message light being on and that Main Office was refusing for some reason to pay to get a repair crew out to service itâ¦if you leave the bathroom light on youâll never notice this light on at night. -Other minor note. Coffee Maker was broken. Shower water temp changes randomly (ainât nothing like taken a hot shower then 3-5 minutes it gets ice cold for about 1-2 minutes then slowly warms up). Noise people (not really the hotelâs fault). Room was a non-smoking room however smelled like a smoky bar (tip to the hotelâFebreze). Unless you are in to these things save you money, save your health, and time....go a little bit up the road to the Days Inn. It is a whole lot better and a better deal. I checked out early and have taken my money to the Days Inn....They could only be better if they had gotten the friendly front desk clerk not say that they are not friendly! Room Tip: find another hotel"
POSITIVE,"We got a tour of the facility upon arrival and the staff was extremely friendly. The room was well kept and clean. The only problem was the birds that they have caged in the court yard. They like to wake up early so put the central fan on every night to cover the noise. Pros: The beds were very comfortable and the staff was friendly Cons: Some of the aspects of the room, such as the carpet and comforters were outdated Location: The location is convienent. Not the nicest neighborhood but it was quiet."
NEGATIVE,"Scratchy sheets, dirty carpet, questionable bathroom."
POSITIVE,"Our stay was exactly what we required, a clean comfortable, no frills room. After a long day on the road all we wanted was a nice place to crash for the night, so we could recharge for our flight the next day. This Best Western fit the bill perfectly, fast check in, clean well appointed rooms, comfortable furniture, fast check out, and best of all a [?] short walk to the airport. Even though the airport is right across the street the rooms are extremely quiet. The best part for me is they allow you to leave your vehicle 5 nights for free with a one night stay, saving us from costly airport parking. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to a friend who was travelling. If you are going for fun one of the casinos may be a better choice for you."
NEUTRAL,"Coming from the Midwest and going to a coastal town I thought it would be a little bit nicer. Located right next to a road and the freeway, the sights weren't anything to speak about. The room was decent but the halls looked weathered. It is interesting that you need a ticket to eat the continental breakfast. Breakfast was decent. The pool & hot tub looked nice but the weather was too cool to at the time to use. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend for a good value for the money."
POSITIVE,We had a great 2 day stay at this hotel. The staff were fantastic. Happy hour with complimentary cheese and biscuits was a nice touch. The location is superb within walking distance to all the main sightseeing spots.
NEGATIVE,"Hotel is close to beach and nice long walkway along beach to downtown. Bed, TV, Cleanliness Ocean View is a small opening between buildings and trees that you can see the Ocean. Not our idea of an Ocean View room. The hot water was intermittent. The TV was snowy on some channels and no audio on some stations. The bed caused my husband to have back pain and not be able to sleep."
POSITIVE,"Inclusive breakfast. Comfy beds, nice shower, pool area."
POSITIVE,The kids loved the waterslide and pool and the room was very nice with very comfortable bedding. The free Breakfast was amazing and even had an omelet chef! The only thing we think they could improve on was the dinner food at the lounge.
POSITIVE,Very nice room
POSITIVE,Friendly staff and food. Nice to have a balcony too DIdn't like the smell from the flooding but that could not be helped Did you find this review helpful? yes no
NEGATIVE,Disliked: Service
POSITIVE,"I stayed here 2 nights while in Surrey visiting family and I thought it was a great choice. The room was very spacious, had a mini fridge, coffee maker and microwave and the bathroom was spacious enough, with plenty of bath products. I thought the beds were pretty comfortable (maybe a bit on the soft side) and there was minimal noise from the road so my sleep wasn't disturbed. All of the staff I encountered were very friendly and courteous, and they told me there was an indoor pool and hot tub that I was welcome to use. I noticed some questionable characters (especially at night) near the edge of the hotel parking lot and by the convenience store next door, but the hotel has taken steps to ensure guests aren't bothered. The lobby door is locked from 9pm to 6am, there are security cameras, and a sign in the elevator advises you not to leave anything in your car so as to prevent theft. There was a coffee and donut shop next door, by the convenience store, and several restaurants and shops across the street and on the other side of the hotel. The nearest Starbucks is just under a mile away (if you're an espresso drinker) so I just made coffee in the room and it was very good. I'd definitely stay here again."
NEUTRAL,"We stopped here on the way to Death Valley; it was a nice quiet place to soak in the hot tub and rest after a long drive. The laundry place just next door was convenient, and so was the mall just down the road for getting restocked. This is another if those slightly older and tired Best Westerns, but its trying hard to keep up to standards. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the place was despite full occupancy."
NEUTRAL,"Nice enough hotel. The grounds, hallways, and rooms were kept very clean. If you have kids, the 2 room suites provide extra space so you're not all stuffed into one small hotel room. The refrigerator is a little small, and the freezer space doesn't actually ""freeze"" anything. Also, there are no plates or utensils in the rooms. The air conditioner is very noisy when it turns on and the faucet in the bathroom is horribly loud. I did find that the bed and pillows were very comfy and the pool was nice. I appreciate the free breakfast. It really helps because a trip to Disneyland will cause bankruptcy. However, it was dreadful. I've had the free breakfasts at a Hampton Inn and a Quality Inn. They were much better quality. The only positive thing about the breakfast here at Best Western are the waffles and the nice man who makes them for you. Overall, it was a decent place and I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Stayed hear with the family for a 6 night Disneyland vacation. After reading the good reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to stay here. To sum it up the place is excellent. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever been on in a hotel. Hot breakfast every day, a close walk to the Block at Orange shopping centre. Also a close taxi ride to Target or Albertsons for a few groceries.. The ART (Anaheim regional transit) stops right at the hotel and then from there it's just a short twenty minute drive to Disneyland. One of the great reasons we stayed here was all the amenities are at this hotel for the right price. The closer you stay to Disneyland the less you get. One of the greatest things about this hotel also is there great customer service. Prior to coming I had gone on the ART website and preordered 5 day bus passes for my family that were supposed to have been delivered to our hotel prior to us arriving and they weren't. So the front desk was very great and helped me track them and then they were delivered them next day. This is not a usual thing, normally they are better at getting them to you than this. ART was also great and refunded us the money we had already used the first day. The hotel also provides a sheet you can take home, you get it from the front desk on a description of their mattresses. I totally reccomend staying here and if I have the chance again I will."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was very clean. It was tucked away from all the traffic with beautiful pool area. Not on beach but only a short drive away. Continental breakfast had alot of items. I wish breakfast would have been longer as far as hours served. There were several resturants near also grocery store. Very close to the St Simmons sights, the village, the lighthouse, etc. The only negative was no refrigerator or microwave in room, other than that it was a very good place to stay. The pool and hot tub were super clean and very large. Room Tip: the rooms on backside by pool had the best view See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Very nice place to stay and would recommend it to friends.Pros: Everyone was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge, who helped us plan some trips. Cons: Had trouble with the TV receiving local channels."
POSITIVE,Indoor pool Lots of noise from indoor courtyard Very close to airport Small indoor pool. Great for families with kids. Indoor courtyard can be noisy when groups use it.
POSITIVE,"It should be call the BW West End but then non-locals wouldn't know where it is. The West End is a mix of office buildings and residential - very nice neighborhood - close to Georgetown (about 5 blocks), Dupont Circle, K street offices and the GWU campus. I got off the Red line from Union Station at Farragut North and then a 4 block walk - you could also use Foggy Bottom station. Got as great busineess rate of $89 on a Sunday night that included breakfast buffet. The floors are small - about 10 rooms per floor but the rooms are nice and fairly large. I had a king bedroom area that was divided from a sitting area and there was also a small kitchen area. All in all a nice, reasonable hotel when visiting DC as a tourist, a parent of GWU student or someone with business on K street."
NEUTRAL,"The room was very clean, comfortable bed, good bath towels, good TV. The only downside I would advise is that the hotel still smells of smoke in some areas, even though it has been ""renovated"". Perhaps permeated into the walls or something, but you can only smell it really at certain times of the day. I did notice the desk clerk REEKED of smoke, and perhaps that is part of the problem. Otherwise, a simple no-frills nothing exciting hotel which is adequate for a stay especially if you're not spending much time actually in the hotel. I was especially happy that the room was decorated in muted colors and tones, and the refrigerator and microwave WORK and are fairly new."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel worked fine for us for two nights, but it could use a few improvements. We had a room with two queen beds which was a good size for a family. I was worried that the beds would be too hard (based on other reviews) but the ones in our room were tolerable. I would suggest to management that they invest in some new vacuum cleaners as the carpets in the room and hallways seemed in need of cleaning (and I made the mistake of looking behind the bed where I found it probably has never been vacuumed- lots of yucky stuff there). The hotel is located between the KMART and highway 99, so you can expect some traffic noise but it wasn't terrible. The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful. Breakfast was fine-- cold items and make-your-own waffles. There are only 7 or 8 tables in the breakfast room so it gets a bit crowded. I'll keep this hotel on my list of good economical hotels in the Chico area. My first choice is always the Diamond Hotel, but this is a decent backup when prices at the Diamond are too high. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the 99 highway if you're a light sleeper"
POSITIVE,"In two rooms, our four member family stayed three nights at this hotel which offered free breakfast, parking and wi-fi. The hotel was spacious and we found it to be very convenient to Tulane (the purpose of our trip), Magazine St, not to far from the cool restaurants off of Carrolton, and a trolley ride into the city. We would stay there again. Room Tip: Rooms towards the back of the hotel are likely to be quieter. See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,I am staying here for a training class. Â I did not book this hotel and I would not book this hotel ever. Â  The lobby smelled like smoke I had to call tech support to get the password for the wireless it took 20 min The room is stinky with dirt marks on the wall and extremely out dated. Â  I asked for a non smoking room and they said they didn't have one. The furniture looks like something from goodwill I stay in a lot of hotels and this is by far one of the worst. I won't be staying here another night if I can help it.
NEUTRAL,It was quiet Poor transport service to the pier in Santa Monica
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay in Auburn. Friendly staff, nice greeting at check in and check out. Clean room and good breakfast. Didn't feel like having a burger at Ikeda's so we went to a new restaurant next door, Joe's Caribe Bistro, it was very good! Close to Raley's market for grocery needs. Will be back when we are in Auburn again!"
POSITIVE,"Speedy pick-up from airport and convenient help for departure. Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Good beds, Hot shower. No problems."
POSITIVE,Over all this hotel was great close to birch run and a great price .Pros: The breakfast they provide is wonderful. Cons: The pool is super small and the workout equipment needs updating.
NEUTRAL,"Although this hotel is showing signs of age and the rooms need updating, the staff are always extremely pleasant and helpful and the location is a definite plus. We stay here several times a year when visiting relatives and a noted improvement was the free breakfast. The area was kept spotlessly clean by a gentleman who offered to make waffles and also served pastries to everyone. I am sorry I did not get his name because he deserves some recognition for doing such a nice job and making everyone feel welcomed at breakfast. Location: East access to beltway and a quick trip to the airport."
NEGATIVE,"the room fro two people had only one towel,one blanket, no coffee maker .everything was unplugged. we came back to a dark room,had to plug in the lamps, tv , phone. the clock radio did'nt work .was afraid the toilet was going to overflow. and there was a soccer game in one of the parking lots.other than that it was fine. the desk said it was sorry . [?] unsincere"
POSITIVE,"Our 2 queen rm for 3 people was very comfortable, clean and roomy. Enjoyed most: The non-cramped feeling and the QUIET, as this is a problem for us at many hotels. Wonder if it's as quiet in summer as it was this Feb. Beds a bit firm, but overall was most comfortable hotel we've stayed in in 3 years. Chose this hotel originally because breakfast wasÂ included. As it turned out this worked perfectly, and helped us get on our way faster, because we didn't have to look for a decent reasonably-priced restaurant. Hope to stay here again."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I visited this hotel on 9/13/11. We found the hotel to be well located, as we were ending our tour of the Finger Lakes Region, and we had one day left for exploring, before returning to Buffalo International Airport for our flight home. Upon our arrival to this hotel, we found the staff to be very prompt, friendly and welcoming. After our check-in was completed, we noticed that we had been assigned to a lower level room. Our reservation print-out clearly stated an upper level, non-pet room (allergy issues) requested; however, in defense of the clerk, when the issue was brought to her attention, she promptly changed our room to an upper level room, and she remained pleasant throughout the process. Not sure about the pet-free request though. During our stay, my sinuses were bothering me, and the next morning, when we were returning to our room after breakfast, we saw a couple leaving the room next to us, with a large dog on a leash. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean and well maintained. The room was located in what appeared to be the back of the hotel, and as such, it was extremely quiet, as we did not hear any noise from any other rooms, the hallway, or the nearby highway. We found the hotel location to be convenient to Rochester and the upper Finger Lakes region. In addition, it was only a short drive back to the Buffalo Airport from this hotel. The clerks were extremely helpful when asked for a restaurant recommendation for dinner and also when giving us directions. This hotel had the best rate of any hotel we experienced during our week-long stay in the Finger Lakes Region. Best Western Plus Victor Inn & Suites appeared to be fairly new, it was very affordable, the staff couldnât have been nicer, and our room was very nice, too. Who could ask for anything more!"
POSITIVE,Stayed two nights. I would return if in that area again.Pros: Large comfortable rooms and bed.
POSITIVE,"It was nicely located next to the interstate and several restaurants. Felt safe and clean. I would only change the views because the only views offered are of the interstate, the parking lot, and a neighboring hotels. Nice staff but not a lot of staff available."
POSITIVE,Our room was OK. It had this weird empty large alcove with a bunch of A/V jacks in the far wall of the alcove. The continental breakfast made it all worthwhile. The scrambled eggs were perfect and the breakfast sausage was incredible.
POSITIVE,"We stayed on a fourth floor suite in the Beach Tower, and it was great. The beach was literally right down the stairs, and the balcony overlook was awesome. The ""living room"" was divided from the rest of the room by a wall about four feet high. The couch had a fold out bed that was plenty comfortable if needed. The breakfast was great...only about a 3 minute walk from the tower. There were fireworks every night we were courtesy of some college kids there but the police spoiled the fun the last night. Overall, the value was pretty good. The location next to the pier is ideal. You can walk almost a 100 yards out into the ocean and still be up to your waist...the waves are just right."
POSITIVE,"Considering that the Walden Galeria Mall is the main tourist attraction for the city of Buffalo, this is a decent hotel that is a close drive for a very reasonable price. The free continental breakfast is also not too bad, but it was CHAOS @ around 8:30 to 9:30 AM as everyone was gunnin' for the waflle-maker (rude teenagers cutting in line) and upset [â¦] at the poor employees cos there was not a constant supply of scrambled eggs to feed their fat bellies. Again, the hotel was fine (I would recommend it), just don't count on the breakfast to be civilized."
POSITIVE,"WE WNT TO GHENT,NY FOR THE MUD BOG RACING, STAYED AT THE BEST WESTERN, AND WENT TO THE CATSKILLS FOR FALL FOILAGE"
POSITIVE,"I really have no complaints about staying at this hotel. Checking in was fast, and we experienced no problems. The room was clean and well furnished. The memory foam mattress were really nice, and the continental breakfast really hit the spot after a night of partying at a nearby venue."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is exactly what you expect in a mid-price hotel: clean, good service, nice rooms, etc. We splurged on a suite, and it was large and well-appointed. Also, this is the first time I have seen the TV remote is in a light, cloth bag labeled ""Fresh Remote"" (I guess they have heard the stories about the remote being the dirtiest thing in a hotel room). It certainly looked clean as a whistle! Nice place, will stay here again next time we are in Bozeman."
NEUTRAL,Not the typical Best Western..bare bones. There was swimming facilties but never used them. The breakfast area is very small and located ajacent to a small check in-counter. Could hear people walking above my room..very noisy. Room Tip: Just off Highway 2
POSITIVE,I would suggest they add another waffle maker as that seemed like the most popular breakfast item during our stay. The location was perfect. The Japanese buffet down the road was an added bonus to our short stay there. I was impressed with the welcomed greeting I received upon checkin. Room met expectations. I would stay there again.
NEUTRAL,"We had a king room, which was nice and spacious. The hotel was quiet, we heard no noises outside our room. The room has a microwave, refrigerator, TV, desk, coffee, iron and ironing board. The rooms are hard wired for the internet, so we could not use two computers at the same time. We needed to print a document, but the printer was broken in their office center, and at the desk. They asked us to use the Hampton Inn. Their breakfast buffet was cereal, pastries, bagels, toast, waffles, coffee and juices."
NEGATIVE,"Not the best not the worst - the room was clean however had hair in the bathtub - no fan in the bathroom - had to open a filthy ground level window for bathroom vent, the window was just above ground level in the back of the hotel and there was an alley and noise back there - unsure of the safety of having this window open. The coffee pot had to be moved and plugged in by thehair dryer because it was located below the air conditioner that was plugged into a 220 outlet. ...Pros: Parts of the room had been updated. Cons: The room air conditioner sticking out, the bathroom window - gross - no fan, the lack of noise reduction on the front of the room,"
POSITIVE,"Good place, I'll stay there again.Pros: Handicapped bathroom. Cons: Lumpy big pillows, cost a little more than it was worth."
NEUTRAL,"* Spent alot of time on pre-planned tours, City, home of the stars, grand ole opry eyc. * I was very dissapointed about the hotel. The person who booked it for me advised me to stay in the Best Western Music Row instead of the one I asked for, and although the location was better than the one I had picked, The hotel itself was not nearly as impressive, and my BIGGEST complaint is that this person stated that she was a regular in Nashville and that this hotel was right off of the main strip and walkind distance from downtown, and this was not even close to being true it would take at least 35 minutes to walk to downtown. She must have mistaken this location for another, on 1st St.This was VERY dissapointing.."
POSITIVE,"I always stay here when I am visiting Glasgow. The staff are always very helpful and polite. The restaurant is of a very good standard. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, including the standard rooms. Obviously it is only a 3 star because of the facilities (no gym, pool, etc) but it is great value for money and you really can't go wrong here."
POSITIVE,Price and location
POSITIVE,"The hotel was nice, nothing special, but the beach was amazing. The restaurant across the street is very average and I do not recommend. The hotel is 3 star, but the beach prompts 4."
POSITIVE,"Clean rooms, comfy beds."
POSITIVE,"After two weeks overseas, great to be in a hotel that was equipped for the guest. Lin (Lyn, Lynn) was quite helpful."
POSITIVE,"We stayed for just one night with our one year-old. Front desk staff was quite friendly and helpful, guiding me to a convenience store at 10pm. Breakfast had a nice variety of hot and cold options - we liked the liberty bell waffle iron. Hotel was within short walking distance to independence mall and a good coffee shop. Would stay again for sure!"
POSITIVE,"Nice Staff. Hotel is right by the beach. Love the parking garage 'inside' the hotel - vehicle is out of the weather. A lot of good places to eat within walking distance. Shuttle for Rehoboth beach/boardwalk was right across the street. Very quiet for the main drag being right outside our door. The 'balcony' was not a balcony. You open the doors in the room and there's a railing. It would have been nice to sit outside while our little one took a nap. Bathroom had a very bad musty smell - the houskeeping staff did spray some air freshener, but we had to keep the exhaust fan on 24/7 to keep it smelling decent."
NEGATIVE,"Option 1: Tried to order a Cheeseburger - ""We don't do Cheesburgers!"" Option 2: Tried to order a New York Strip Steak - ""We Don't Do Steaks For Room Service Orders"" Option 3: Can I have a Calzone, then (It was listed in the Room Service Menu) - ""We only do Calzones for lunch orders"" So, I ended up ordering some Pasta from Pizza Hut.I don't see the point in putting out a Room Service Menu, when the Hotel has no intention of supplying what is offered. Room Tip: Avoid the Restaurant."
POSITIVE,"The fridge was much larger than any I've ever had in a hotel room, even much more expensive one. The pool has limited hours, but has a life guard on duty. He was cool to talk with also. The staff was always friendly and professional. It was right across the bridge from Arlington Cemetery, which we didn't know until the day we left. The only complain, [?] which we mentioned on the way out, was that our shower went from extreme temperatures constantly. I would definitely stay here again!"
POSITIVE,"The view of the pool and ocean from our room Elevators took forever 2 miles away from Ocean Drive. Took a cab to get to the main strip. Parking garage is not attached to the hotel, it is 2 blocks away, $25/day. The room was clean, beds were actually comfy. One of the better rooms I have stayed in in South Beach. The view was amazing from our room though! We had an ocean front room on the 6th floor. Elevators were a little slow going."
POSITIVE,"We stayed in Room 115, downstairs. The room has two queen beds, flat screen TV, small micro and small refrigerator. The room was very clean and nice. The towels are a nice size and soft. They provide a shampoo/conditioner/shower gel dispenser in the shower. Water for the morning shower was hot right away. The have free internet - it's not 4G but it works. While we were here for two days, the drink vending machine didn't work very well and the pool was out of order. We picked this hotel for the indoor/outdoor pool - which we didn't get to use - very disappointing. They offer breakfast - make your own waffle, ceral, oatmeal, yogert, fruit, toast, bagel and hard boiled eggs. Juice, coffee, tea, hot cocoa. Also there's coffee in the room. Room was very clean, nice size and beds comfy; lots of pillows. Room Tip: It's only a two story hotel, I don't recall seeing an elevator."
POSITIVE,I went to stay there couple of days ago...sch a great experience..the front desk staff greeted us in a very welcoming and cheerful manner..the facilities provided and the cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic. enjoyed swimming and other facilities there...i loved going there..and would recommend to all to visit and see their warmness...
NEGATIVE,"I arrived at OHare at 9:15pm by bus and called the hotel 10 minutes before arriving to let them know we were on our way and needed shuttle pick up. We were told the shuttle would be there. We (myself and my 3 young kids) waited 15 minutes, no shuttle. I called back, they said they were on their way. 15 more minutes, no shuttle, so I called back again. Meanwhile, my kids are tired and sweating hot and sitting on the filthy sidewalks waiting for the shuttle. I see every other hotel shuttle is working on their 2nd round of pickups by now. I finally find out the hotel doesn't have a shuttle at all, but they call a taxi instead (not what they advertise). I wait until 10:25pm (over an hour wait!!) before the taxi arrives. I am ANGRY! I get to the hotel at 10:50pm and they don't care at all. I go up to my room and the ""A/C"" barely blows out lukewarm air all night. We have to get up at 3:30am to have time to make our flight (with no sleep) because the room is hot all night. I couldn't jump in the shower in the am because we arrived so late that I needed to sleep as long as possible. I Will NEVER stay at this hotel again!"
POSITIVE,"my husband and I spent the night at the beginning of November and had a wonderful night. We thoroughly enjoyed the deluxe continental breakfast, staff was very friendly and helpful as well. We will be back"
POSITIVE,"I recently stayed at this hotel during my visit to Myrtle Beach, SC. The hotel is immaculate and the staff is friendly and eager to help. They are polite and very knowledgeable about the area and the breakfast was great! Room Tip: ask for double room with 3 queen size bed-very comfortable and has a kitchenette"
POSITIVE,"I've not been on a vacation since 2008. I had been to Myrtle Beach 4 other times over the years and felt that I wanted to go back there once again. My significant other and I drove (18 hours!) and although we weren't supposed to check in until Monday (we got there on Saturday), we were given the room that was going to be ours come Monday so that we didn't have to move. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome. Theresa is a 'peach' and makes sure you have all that you need at breakfast. The reception area has great customer service and they are all knowledgeable, which helps. The room was great and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. We were there from 12/10 through 12/16 so we didn't get to use the pool. The construction had me a bit confused when we first got there, but this place will be looking super once it's completed. I have plans to go back there again in April or May of 2012 with my adult daughter. I would love to stay there, but would really like to stay in a room where I could see the ocean. I'll have to discuss that when I make my reservations. Other than that, this is a great find and it would be so sad if you didn't stay here. I will stay here again....the sooner the better. All the attractions are easy to find from here, also. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room. We were at the end on the corner."
POSITIVE,"I would recommend anyone to stay here, was with my 12 yr old son, ocean front, great hotel, no problems, very clean, service was great,I will return next year!-Jeff Janowski Crown Point In. Room Tip: Read reviews See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,"Doing renovation, many rooms unavailable, lots of pounding during the day. On very busy street. Had to look at 3 rooms before we found one that had the least noise, either pounding, or by elevator from the garage with bed headboard on elevator wall, very bad!! The room we ended up with was very nice, delux, but getting there was a trial. Staff, depending [?] on who was at the front desk, ran from brisk to finally a young man who really wanted us to be satisfied."
POSITIVE,We had a great experience at this hotel. The room was recently renovated and really nice with comfortable beds adn linens. The check in and out process were great with nice staff. And the lobby is lovely. This was a great surprise to find such a nice hotel.
POSITIVE,"Beautifully decorated, warm, and comfortable. We didn't want to leave. We had to check-out:( My wife, son, and I truly enjoyed our stay at this Best Western hotel. We were visiting the University of North Texas to take a tour since our son will be an attending Freshman Fall 2012. The room was more luxurious than some of the 5-Star hotels that we have stayed in previously. We were in a room with a King-size bed and a separate couch with a fold-out bed. The 40 inch plus flatscreen tv displayed a beautiful digital picture and there were many local and cable channels to choose from. There were two quiet ceiling fans as well, which really helped circulate the air from the air-conditioning unit. The room also included a microwave, mini-fridge, and a safe:) The bathroom had a large shower with a glass door. This was a welcome change since most hotel rooms have bathtubs (that we don't use). Additionally, the shower had a wide showerhead with separate jets on the wall directly above the handles. The room was very modern, but had a warm welcoming feel. Furthermore, the room was spotless. Our family didn't get a chance to go swimming, however, the pool area was gorgeous. We will be traveling back to Denton in June for orientation at UNT and will definitely stay there. In conclusion, I rarely write reviews or do surveys, however, I felt compelled to let people know about this gem of a hotel."
NEUTRAL,The free breakfast was not great but the Hotel staff were very helpful. The Hotel is on TX 290 which is under construction. The road is normally two-way on each side of the highway but is now temporarily one way on each side making access to the hotel a bit tricky. Overall the place is very nice and I recommend it for the price.
POSITIVE,"Comfortable, clean room.Light and bright. A room change was required as a result of a malfunctioning toilet. The night manager handled this effectively without any problem, providing an upgrade gratis. Enjoyable breakfast. A connecting restaurant serves a mean dish of battered walleye too!"
POSITIVE,"Due to the fatigue of spending a day shopping for a used vehicle, we decided on the spur of the moment to spend the night in Nashville, IL rather than make the short trip back home. The front desk was very friendly and when I stated that we didn't have any luggage, she promptly gave us toothpaste, toothbrush & comb. The room was immaculate...not one single thing wrong with it. The next morning we enjoyed a great breakfast, and more of the friendly front desk staff. I highly recommend the Best Western in Nashville, IL. Room Tip: Room 201 is a good location because it is at the end of the building so you only have one room next..."
NEGATIVE,"My wife, 2 kids and I arrived in Portland around 7 pm and when went online to look for a hotel. Surprisingly there were very few rooms available in the entire city. We took the highest rated hotel available which was the Best Western. For $200+ we got a room with 2 doubles and a free breakfast. Our first impression of this hotel / motel is that it is old. The carpets / decor are very dated and the room just felt unclean. I'm not saying it was unclean as we did not see anything but it just felt that way because of the carpet, drapes and heavy old bedcovers and blankets. We ate dinner at the restaurant attached to the hotel. Dinner was cheap but decent. The decor in the restaurant matched the room. The full breakfast was at the same restaurant. You could either get bacon / sausage and eggs or eat at the buffet. We had the buffet and were quite satisfied with the food. In conclusion, I had no complaints about this hotel, just that I felt I paid 4 star pricing for a 2 star hotel."
POSITIVE,"Travelling with my 2 teens, we were using a ""Coupon book"" from Fl welcome center. stopped first at Quality inn where we were told they had rooms but not at the advertised rate??*#!? But it worked out fine because we found this property! Paid $75.90 including tax. Room was clean. Fridge was handy. I had a lovely evening swim & jacuzzi soak all to myself. Breakfast was good had nice variety. Paid $7. to park @ town structure to tour St. Augustine. At the end of the day we realized we had checked out & left our water bottle in the fridge. When we came back they had it for us. Room Tip: We chose 1st floor since we were just there overnight"
POSITIVE,"My room was large, clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. I recently stayed in a hotel which cost more than 3 times as much as I paid for this one and I was not nearly as comfortable. I give this hotel a high recommendation!"
NEGATIVE,"First: please note that there is a Kelly Inn as well as the Best Western Kelly Inn in Billings. Having looked at the reviews for the non-BW Kelly Inn, I get the distinct feeling some guests are erroneously posting their reviews for the Best Western Kelly Inn under the other propertyâs listing. This review is for the Best Western, which is fee-free pet-friendly and offers ground level accommodations with both an exterior and interior door. I was planning to give this property a 4 star review. Our first five nights were fine, but the last three (a weekend) were so awful, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone unless you can sleep through anything, or youâre not traveling with a dog (and can therefore request a top floor room). We booked a weeklong+ stay online, requesting a pet-friendly king âbusinessâ room with our AAA rate. At check-in, my husband was told that the only room available was a two queen setup. Why? Because one night â the next night â there wasnât a king room available. We could take a king for the first night, then weâd have to move and then we could move again the third night. This didnât make a lot of sense to me. If we also had a reservation and were staying for over a week, why would they say that someone who wasnât even there yet had precedence? Fortunately, the manager saw to it that we were given a king room for the length of our stay, requiring no move. The room itself was nice. We were on the west side of the building, which meant our vehicle could be parked literally at our front door. It was easy to walk the dog. The second half of our stay it became impossible to get the spaces in front of our room. There were a lot of guests with large trucks, and we were required to either trip through the ankle-breaking rock gardens or squeeze in between othersâ large vehicles. This is tough when youâre trying to bring your suitcases and whatnot in or out, especially when itâs icy. Iâm surprised by the number of complaints about the comfort of the beds. I sleep in a super soft bed at home and typically find the average hotel bed uncomfortable, or at least that it induces some sort of ache. The king bed we had was perfectly comfortable â I had no problems. There were five pillows on the bed, but we travel with our own. The microwave took up most of the bathroom counter, which was unfortunate. There was a nice little shelf tucked behind the interior door, which held the coffeemaker and ice bucket. Itâs too bad they didnât design the rooms to accommodate the microwave elsewhere. We had problems with things in the refrigerator freezing, even though we turned it all the way down and tried to keep items away from the freezer part. It was a nice sized fridge, though, and we were happy to have it. We did not make use of the âwaterparkâ style pool. It was actually a negative to us when we were deciding if thatâs where we wanted to stayâ¦and we were right. We enjoyed a very quiet work week, but then come Friday night, a loud family was given the room directly above us and we had to listen to their stomping for the entire weekend. After 11PM the second night, we called the front desk and complained, but the noise continued until after 1AM again. Management insisted it was not the same guest(s)â¦so that means everyone sounds that loud. We did not partake in the âfreeâ breakfast. I would prefer not to absorb the extra cost of a hotel offering such things, but travelers seem to demand it (and then complain very loudly in reviews about the quality of the âfreeâ breakfast). People - itâs not free! The heating/cooling system drove us bonkers. It was an under-the-window unit, with a wall control. As it was winter, we desired a heat setting. There was no such option on the control for âheatâ or âcoolâ, simply an up/down temperature, with auto/lo/high fan settings. If you cranked it up, you could get hot air to blow and toast up the room nicely. Then youâd try to turn it down a bit, but the system would immediately switch to blowing cold air. We turned the system to âOFFâ in an effort to stop the cold air from blowing, but soon discovered that the fan came on, once every five minutes, for ten seconds. It blew cold air, no matter what. This was extremely frustrating, as there was a plastic hood over the vents, directing this cold air to blow directly onto the bed. All. Night. Long. I canât say if every unit in the building functions this way. If youâre traveling in the winter, check out your unit before you unpack everything."
POSITIVE,"People were so friendly here. Family oriented. The staff was top notch, in our opinion. This was the most peaceful and relaxing vacation we have had in years. Room Tip: Neat ,clean, and comfortable. What we asked for extra, we got in a timely manner. Yes, we loved it here. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"The hotel looks like an old Spanish hacienda with really nice grounds, lush foliage, lots of palm trees and interior gardens! Our room was on the first floor, facing the parking lot, however, it was very clean and comfortable, the AC was quiet and with the windows closed we did not hear a sound from the outside - even though the hot tab was really close by. Next morning we had an excellent breakfast at the hotel's restaurant upstairs. Bottom line: a perfect overnight stay offering everything a couple of tired travellers may need. Actually, we think of going back there sometime to spend a few days, as the little town of Carpinteria seems to be a good spot in general and has a nice beach at the ocean - 5 minutes from the hotel. Room Tip: I suspect the upper floors may have more privacy, a better view and may also be quiter even with the..."
POSITIVE,"Easy freeway on/off.. felt safe, the parking layout made it easy for our trailer. Would definitely recommend &the stay there again."
NEUTRAL,Two floor motel with too few staircases. The grounds are spread out and can be inconvenient. Bathroom very small and tub did not drain well. Everything was just a little off. People were friendly . We had to have keys remade twice and noticed others having the same problem. Seemed to be about the best for Payson
POSITIVE,"I can agree with a lot of the other comments. The hotel is in a ""borderline"" area between the the Tnderloin and Nob Hill areas. There are homeless and beggers in the area and sometimes close to the hotel, but one see's that throughout San Francisco even by the Hilton. The location on Geary streeet is about 3 blocks from Union Square and there are many art galleries on Geary with excellent exhibits. The hotel itself is almost a boutique style hotel,. Yes the rooms are not as large as some others, but they remionded me of travelling in EUrope with those size hotel rooms. The travel/movie posters that are in the rooms add atmosphere. The free continental breakfast is better than a lot of other Best Western's I've been to. As far as the noise, I was there in winter and the windows were closed , the rooms do have heat. I can see how it would be noisy if the windows were open in the summer. But again, one finds that in any large city. All in all I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel and will be staying there on future trips. Room Tip: I would think a higher floor would be better for less street noise."

POSITIVE,"Our bill was completely paid prior to check-in. During the check-in process, the hotel desk clerk said that the hotel had to charge our credit card for an additional $50.00 for incidentals - up front! Never heard of this policy! And no receipt was given nor was any signature taken for the credit card charge!"
NEUTRAL,"Our room was small but well appointed. The bathroom was clean. It had a large stall shower; not the tub/shower combination as advertised. However, that was great. We were supplied with plenty of towels and quality bath supplies. The view of the river was very nice and the staff was super friendly and helpful. The two drawbacks were the bed and the breakfast. Breakfast was served in a small windowless room on the third floor. The selection was minimal and we opted for a bowl of cold cereal without fruit. The bananas looked weeks old. The bed was so old and mushy that it really interrupted my sleep. I got in bed and sank into a hole and was afraid that I would need a crane to get me out! We actually considered leaving at the end of the second day instead of spending the night. Room Tip: Ask to check the bed in your room before you unpack! Pack your own breakfast food and your own coffee and coffee pot."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at two Best Western hotels on this trip and this was by far the nicest for the money. The rooms were very spacious and the wet bar with its extra sink was appreciated by our family of 4. The beds were not quite as comfy as the other BW but adequate. As others have stated in reviews, the service at breakfast was superb. It's nice to have hot options on a complimentary breakfast buffet. The house keeping very good and the hotel was very bright and welcoming. We chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews not on location. Unless you have business near by the location is a bit out of the way as the main freeway it is on is a toll road. The immediate vacinity is nice though. We will be considering Best Western more on our future trips."
NEGATIVE,"Good news: 1. nice big room. 2. Parking is gated. Bad news: 1. Area is dump 2. scary to walk even day light in the area..looks like many prosti and drug ad. 3. People off street walk in for free breakfast. I watched them as they go in. 4. There were cows wrestling up floor. We heard all comotions . restless nights. 5. 4 nights, last night we stayed, people were fighting 2 am for 2 hours 6. Too far from disneyland, universal studios or even too far for everything else for that matter. 7. Staff doesnt seemed like their jobs. 8. Wifi ad is a joke..we stayed at 2nd floor and not working at all. I could have stayed somewhere better for the price i paid."
POSITIVE,Great service and hospitality. Very nice room. Highly recommended.
POSITIVE,"We stayed 2 nights mid week in December. Very inviting and impressive entrance. We had booked a twin room and were pleasantly surprised to find two very comfortable double beds. The room was very spacious and had everything you would want, including unlimited free wifi access. The bathroom had a bath with overhead shower. Everything was immaculately clean, full marks for the housekeeping staff. The weather outside was very cold and windy, however the room was really warm and cosy. We had booked Dinner Bed and Breakfast. The breakfast was very good, however, we were a little dissappointed when the main courses on the second eveing were the same as the first evening. There were 6 choices however, two of these the steak (Â£4+) and lamb(Â£2) had a surcharge, this left a risotto, a poached fish, belly pork, and chicken. I had the fish on the first night - it was good but the second night I had the risotto, very disappointing, just very bland rice and peas, my husband had chicken both nights. The staff in the restaurant were very pleasant but certainly over stretched. The leisure facilities were very good, only negative would be that it is not in the hotel main building but across the car park, so it meant going outside, which would be fine in the summer but on the cold very windy days we were there it was quite chilly. All the staff we encountered were efficient and friendly. I have tried not to be too negative because we really did enjoy our stay and would not hesitate to return, the points I have highlighted are minor but I feel are worth mentioning. Thank you for a lovely stay Room Tip: The hotel is in the process of renovating the rooms, request a renovated room."
POSITIVE,"Excellent, clean, beds very comfortable. You can enter rooms from either inside of hotel or outside. Great stop leaving Texas heading towards Colorado!"
POSITIVE,it was great from the time we arrived to the time and day we left
POSITIVE,I have always had a good experience at this hotel. Last minute sale on Expedia made it even better. Bar and Restaurant attached to hotel offer quality meals and service!
POSITIVE,"Standard size room that has been upgraded with comfortable bed & decor. Room had microwave, fridge, personal coffee maker, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, curved show curtain, really good hot water supply. ONLY negative could be carpet was slightly dirty but not bad enough to bother me. GREAT free breakfast with biscuits, gravy, sausage, scrambled eggs, waffles, fruit, and the other normal stuff with a microwave to touch up the hot food. Quality of hot food is good enough but not fantastic or anything. Parking lot is well lit. 24hr restaurant is right next to the motel and serves good food. Two hamburger joints close by. Light rail DART - 3.5 miles to park and ride at Mockingbird Station. Location is quiet enough. Fairly easy access to Highway 75."
POSITIVE,Excellent staff helped us a lot with directions and suggestions. Very good location near Hollywood Blvd and Hollywood sign.
POSITIVE,Very good. With easy check in. Nice room. Free continental breakfast. Good location.
POSITIVE,"Free internet access and free printing No microwave in the room. Away from the city but close enough to get to anywhere you want. Very comfortable and affordable hotel for everyone to stay at. It is away from the city but close enough to enjoy being halfway between things. Also, I love the fact that they provide complimentary breakfast along with free internet"
POSITIVE,"We agree to all the reviews for this place. It really is a clean,affordable and in good location. Room Tip: Internet site See more room tips"
POSITIVE,The location was fabulous One of the front desk staff was hateful when we asked a question about subway when we did not understand directions with her foreign accent. For the price of the hotel we expected hospitality we had the same experience with the concierge. We would stay elsewhere next time.
NEGATIVE,"Managament - Unflexible, he didn't even show up to speak personally with us. Standard rooms are ridiculously small, non walk able with a standard suitcase."
NEUTRAL,"The bed was very comfortable .. The reception staff was very friendly I was late for my check out time for 10 minutes exactly, although I asked the reception for that and it ok, the housekeeping was knocking hard on the door asking me to leave the room and entered the room while I was getting dressed ! I believe it is a housekeeping mistake completely although the management should do better job ! There was a noise coming out of the A/c without it even turned on ! Room 1324 to be specidfic .."
POSITIVE,I was a truck driver that got in an accident and the managers and coworkers of this hotel gave the best hospitality to me as a guest. The rooms were very clean and the food was great! I mentioned it to my family and they would love to come visit this place. I would definitely recommend any other travelers to stay at Best Western! Sincerely Arthur Garcia
POSITIVE,"eenvoudig maar verzorgd, goede bedden, goed sanitair, schoon"
POSITIVE,"We came in for Car Week in Carmel in August, 2011. Many covered parking spaces available, although they are on the tight side- important for us with the damp weather. Queen rooms are nicely decorated*, fairly spacious, and have gas fireplaces. They are lacking refrigerators and microwaves, expected at BW Plus level. Wireless internet reception is spotty for our I-Pad, but worked good on the laptop. Good continental breakfast is provided, the staff does a good job keeping things up to snuff. *Giant heavy quilts may look nice, and be fine for winter, but are bulky and hard to work around in warmer weather. Either too hot or too cold, with no in-between."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Service, Location, Value, Rooms"
POSITIVE,family suite; breakfast; hot tub right off Interstate 76--easy to find Great hotel for a family of 6. Loved the family suite---perfect for our family. Hot tub and breakfast were both super. Staff very friendly. Would stay again.
POSITIVE,when you arrive at the airport to catch the shuttle back to the hotel DO NOT ASSUME IT WILL ARRIVE PHONE THEM
NEGATIVE,Worst experience. Hotel didn't have any glasses or wine glasses. No bottle water service nor did the vending machine had any. Lost money on the vending machine as no water bottels came out. The front desk didn't even refund the money as it is not affiliated with the vending machine company. Really old bathrooms. Very poor service
POSITIVE,The accommodations were spotless and a great launching place to Wilton Manors and a number of great restaurants and shopping. The pool and Tiki bar were very nice and the staff was very nice and hospitable.
POSITIVE,"After our first experience staying at the Ramkota almost two years ago, my husband and I stay here EVERY time we're in Bismarck...which is several times a year. We refuse to stay ANY where else. Most of the time we stay in the Bridal Suite because it is SO luxurious, with a gas fire place, a huge jacuzzi tub and and the most comfortable King-sized bed we've ever slept in during our stays in hotels. We've stayed in other Best Western Hotels in many cities throughout the US, but the super-helpful, friendly staff who assist us every time we're there make it our favorite of all hotels. They know us by name and treat us each time just like we're family, especially Bob, the shuttle driver. I wish the Ramkota management could train the staff at ALL of the Best Western Hotel chain because they're definately doing it right!!! Room Tip: That's a hard one, because I think they're all good. If you have kids, choose a room closer..."
NEUTRAL,"Great location, good hotel for the price. They could improve on the decoration of the rooms and the maintenance. I was there in winter time and the room was too hot, there was no way to get it to a decent temperature. Also, the shower sometimes made a rattling noise when running. Pros: Location - half a block from Times Square Cons: The decoration of the room and the overall maintenance"
NEGATIVE,"This was like stepping back in time to stay in an old fashioned motel. The TV was a giant box from the 80's that had huge purple bands around the fuzzy picture. The bedding was grey and thin. The so called complimentary breakfast is held in tiny area to the left of the check-in desk. Your kitchen at home is larger. The food selection was poor. We ended up driving to Tim Horton's. The pool is enclosed in a dingy dome and smokers were everywhere....yech!!! We were on our way from Banff to Whistler and had it not been a weekend where everything was booked, we would have left and gone elsewhere. We would never recommend this place to anyone unless they pulled it down and built a real Best Western. It certainly reflects poorly on the chain."
POSITIVE,"Great value hotel in a great location. Very spacious suites, free parking and internet. Breakfast is OK, not great. Pros: Spacious rooms Cons: Nothing Location: Great! Easy access to all Orange Country freeways"
POSITIVE,"We were impressed with the roominess and the comfort of the queen beds. The hotel seemed a bit older, but we would stay there again."
POSITIVE,Very comfortable & quiet room while there--staff was exceptionally courteous and friendly. We will stay there the next time we come to Savannah-- the best hotel so far that we've stayed in while visiting our son & family in Savannah. It was a good location and not far from their home. Thanks so much.
POSITIVE,"Our room was in great condition, loved the set up, flat screen TVs and modern furniture were a nice touch. Felt like a full kitchen with tons of space!! I wish breakfast lasted longer!!!"
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Plus Coeur d'Alene Inn is a very nice hotel; convenient location, clean, quiet, pleasant, attractive, our room was very spacious. It was great having two beds, the refrig, Microwave, iron and ironing board, even little things like a shower cap and soaps and lotion. The staff was so courteous and helpful. We received the local newspaper every day - loved that!Pros: Liked its attractiveness; the staff were friendly and helpful. Really like the complimentary breakfast!! Loved receiving the local newspaper each day. Cons: Husband's bed was fine, but my bed was very uncomfortable, sloped to the side and to the head - not good! The heater malfunctioned."
POSITIVE,"Location location on this one - just a block or two from the Walk of Fame. Great views of the Hollywood sign from nearby shopping mall (don't drive around for hours like my husband and I did trying to get a better shot - this was by far the best view). Price was a little steep for a Best Western, but competative rate considering it was in Hollywood. There is a small bistro on site that serves basic but tasty snack food which was reasonably priced. Parking is premium in Hollywood and there was ample room in the parking lot for no extra charge. The room was clean, quiet and pretty spacious - this was the ideal stopover for one night passing through on our way to Vegas."
POSITIVE,"This brand of motels usually does fairly well. I'd consider this place to be well above the average as far as cleanliness, facilities, etc. are concerned. Calling it a ""spa"" is a bit silly, since all they've done is convert one room into a hot tub facility with a tiny spa in the middle. But everything else is just fine -- excellent plumbing fixtures -- why can't so many motels get that right? Comfortable beds, flat screen TVs, everything worked as advertised. Happy camper."
POSITIVE,"We were passing through this town and checked out the reviews. The most recent ones were very good and I am glad we stayed here too. THe clerk was very attentive, pleasant and offered a discount to us. The lobby was very nicely decorated for the holidays and a pleasing welcome. THe room was beautiful. Had a modern flat screen tv, large beds and beautifully decorated and spotless. The bath was nice with the vanity outside the tub area. Found a small frig and m/w tucked in cabinet with tv area. THey had a continental breakfast that was nice and a clerk was available to help, replenish items and make waffles. Had several hot items available too. Overall I would recommend this hotel and stay again. Room Tip: The only drawback for this town was that all the hotels were set off the interstate. We did not realize when exiting but all accomodations were this far. Best Western was actually the closest but worth the drive. Another guest mentioned the mom and pop cafe across was very good.."
NEGATIVE,"Stayed at this hotel a little over a month 1/2 ago. Was completely disappointed with my stay. While the staff was very nice, the room was in horrible condition. Rust stains on the toilet and bathroom floor, carpets in the room and throughout the hotel covered in stains, as well as chairs in the room. None of the windows on the second floor had screens on them, and at one point me and my friend were down in the pool and a little girl on the second floor was leaning out of her room waving at us. Completely unsafe!! That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. At one point during the night I dropped something behind the TV stand and when I went to move it out to grab it, I was greeted by months worth of dust built up, not to mention the TV station guide that we had been looking for. Lastly in the breakfast room there was a tip jar out... We were down there for a half hour and didn't see the breakfast person once, why in the world should I tip them?? When I complained to the hotel I was told that basically since I never said anything during my stay (I was told when I made the res that I got the last smoking room, so what would be the point of asking to move??) that besides an apology that there was nothing they could do. so basically I wasted 16,000 points on a hotel that IMHO isn't worth 1,000. There are much nicer looking hotels in the immediate area of this one, and I highly suggest staying at one of them!"
POSITIVE,"My adult brother and sister and I go traveling twice a year together and always stay at a Holiday Inn Express. We have always had great service and the people that work their are always so nice and go above and beyond to help. The only ""bad thing"" I could say was about the bathtub showers , it is impossible to find the mechanism to turn the shower on. After 20 minutes of trying I gave up and took a bath instead of a shower , I was extremely frustrated and it made me angry for about an hour afterwards. I went to the front desk and asked they were helpful , but knew it was a problem because they had a demo on the front desk. Could they have not told us when we checked in to save the frustration ? Out of the17 family members staying at the hotel , only 2 figured it out ! Room Tip: great rooms , clean , new looking, comfortable See more room tips"
POSITIVE,This was a great place to stay. Close to the town of Henderson with great shopping. The hotel was more than expected. What a great breakfast. I will definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,Easily accessible.
POSITIVE,"Those who stay at BW hotels know they can be hit or miss. I thought the McKinney Texas property was a hit. We stayed one night on our way to a cruise vacation. Our large room in this newer property, on the highest floor, was clean, quite, and well decorated. The beds were firm, but comfortable. The shower had good pressure and nice soaps and shampoos. Since this was just an overnight stop and we just wanted a quick bite, the Whataburger across the parking lot worked for us. The exercise room is small with just a treadmill, bike, and elliptical trainer, but met my needs. In fact the treadmill was a newer, model with more features than my health club has! We found the breakfast to be more than satisfactory, however some of the young people staying there for sports could have benefited from better manners and turn-taking and made breakfast more enjoyable for all. Overall we felt the accommodations were better than others we've experienced at this price point."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here in early August for two nights. The hotel is a typical Best Western, but is in need of renovation. The very hokey wall decor of cut-out pine trees in the hallways was just too odd and totally dated the place. Everything at the hotel and in our room was tired. Breakfast was typical hotel stuff. The location is decent in close proximity to the downtown area."
POSITIVE,"The room itself was clean, however, the bathrooms are outdated and the sink and toilets were very low to the ground (I'm 5'9 and it was quite a stoop for both. Also, the hallways could of been cleaner.....for 24 hours I had to continuously walk by two large clumps of dark hair on the top of the stairs leading to my room on the 2nd floor. I enjoyed the [?] breakfast buffet every morning but noticed some items weren't restocked or resupplied (such as the eggs and bacon) so always ended up with just a muffin and coffee, it seemed. The staff was very pleasant and the fitness room and pool were a nice surprise."
POSITIVE,"I would recommend this place. Clean rooms, friendly staff. I would stay there again!! Pros: Clean facility, friendly staff, good breakfast Location: Easy access, shopping and food venues close by."
NEGATIVE,"Tried to check in using a couple the front desk hardly looked at it and said to those rooms are gone, I asked him about aaa discount and he quoted rack rate.I Walked out"
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here many times ( it does look a bit scruffy in places but DONT let that put you off ) The staff are GREAT the rooms are EXCELLENT with lots ( and I mean lots ) of facillaties. They overlook either the pool area , or the small putting course. Its clean , friendly and quiet. The breakfast ( served by the pool ) is excellent, and free !!!!. Its got great parking . the only down side ( if you can call it that ) is there is NO lift ( elevator ) but if this is a problem for you , just ask for a ground floor room. All rooms have either a patio or balcony with good chairs and tables, great for relaxing at night with a nice drink !! Its my partners favourite hotel in FLORIDA she calls it HOME FROM HOME it really is that good. A nice pleasant 15 minute stroll to the fantastic beach. I could go on & on but I will just say its the BEST VALUE HOTEL in Naples Room Tip: Best rooms (we think ) are overlooking the pool But all rooms are great"
POSITIVE,"I travel very frequently in the Chicago area and the Best Western Plus Oakbrook Inn is by far my favorite place to stay. The staff are wonderful and incredibly friendly. I have stayed here on three different occasions and have always been greeted with a smile. In addition, they have remembered me each time I've come back! Staying at the Oakbrook Inn I feel right at home - it's smaller, the rooms are spacious, very clean, and very comfortable. The location is great being right off of IL 83 yet in a quiet, comfortable environment. The breakfast dining area is one of the best I've experienced - food is fresh and the eating area is always clean and inviting. Overall, I love staying here and highly recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area!!"
POSITIVE,"Front desk service was excellent and the room was nicely furnished, although just a bit cramped - very hard to get past the bed because the chair at the desk blocked the way. The room was basically clean, although they hadn't cleaned along the bed - we saw a penny and other debris (possibly food). Our complaint was handled immediately and the room was spotless for the rest ofour stay. ...Pros: Location was perfect for walking around historic area of Charleston. Free parking and Wifi. Great service. Cons: Room was a bit cramped and very far from lobby."
POSITIVE,hotel was not bad.room was acceptable as far as cleanliness was concerned.
NEGATIVE,"I was very disappointed in this hotel for the price. The beds are advertised as queens - but sure look like double beds to me. The room was clean but no microwave or refrigerator - no excuse for that. Pool hours were advertised to start at 7 a.m. (quiet time) till 9 a.m. Maintenance man cleaned pool from 7am to 8 am - not really allowing for use ofÂ pool till 8. I sat in hot tub for 1 hour waiting for him to finish cleaning the pool - ridiculous! Given map for local restaurants at front desk - poor photo copy of a map with a scribbled list of restaurant names on back - very unprofessional and confusing. Hotel was quiet - not noisy like a lot of reviews said. Breakfast buffet was a joke - Costco muffins cut in half, bananas & cold cereal. Waffles could be made. Hot water for tea was barely warm. Would never stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"We paid extra to have a jacuzzi in the room but it didn't work and the maintaince person could not be located and the pool was closed, the gate was locked, so we had to pay to stay in a nice hotel not to be able to use either the pool or jacuzzi. We were told that they couldn't do anything about it because it was prepaid through an online agency. I don't know, is this how you run a business? The staff was great, but the owners need to take responsibility for thier hotel!"
POSITIVE,The air conditioning was so very noisy that sleep was impossible. We left there and went to the Hampton Inn.
NEUTRAL,"I stayed here for 3 days and felt very comfortable. The rooms were very clean, this is an older property but was well maintained. Frank in the breakfast area was very helpful and able to provide info on the area. You can walk around the building and your 5 minutes away from the beach. Would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,"We were very pleased with our choice of this Best Western and often sat out on the deck to enjoy the fantastic view. At the start, I was a little daunted at being placed on a lower level after booking these 4 nights several months in advance and specifically requesting the top level to access the views, but the desk clerk was very accommodating about finding a better room. The room was very clean, the coffee and the continental breakfast were good and fresh, but the in-suite coffee was not drinkable (we bought our own at the nearby Frontiers market). All in all a good place to stay in Sedona and we would return."
POSITIVE,"The quality of the housekeeping was exceptional and responsive. They skipped cleaning our room on the days we asked. When they did clean, it was very well done! Also, the breakfast room was maintained by an employee all through the morning breakfast period. Nothing ran out!!! The food was good and varied. The only problem was that we had to walk out [?] from our room into the elements on cold winter days to get to the breakfast room. It would be much earier during the summer!"
POSITIVE,"This is a great value within Sedona - yes, it's a bit outside the city center, but you are just a few minutes drive away. The room was comfortable and clean. We were on the 1st floor and didn't have any views from the room but it was worth it anyway - the price was much less than other hotels in the area. How did we compensate? We had our take out dinner on the patio on the upper level. It was breathtaking to be outside watching the sun set on the red rocks. It's always great to have breakfast included. :)"
POSITIVE,"Staff was very pleasant each time they were approached with an easy check-in also. Room was immaculate and up to date with pleasant surrroundings. Our room had a refrigerator and small microwave with a coffee service. In the lobby the breakfast is great with an assortment of hot sausage, scrambled fresh eggs, donuts, bagels, cereals(hot & cold), waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit and fruit in juice too. We especially appreciated the 24 hr. hot chocolate and coffee in the lobby after a day on the slopes. They do not have a swimming pool but do have a nice hot tub in an adjacent small building. We stay here each time we come to ski Winter Park. Nice walking distance to restaurants close-by."
POSITIVE,"We needed a place to stay with our puppy and was happy to find out they have pet friendly rooms. Our room had a patio door right out to a small yard, which was great for letting the dog out. When we checked in, the front desk gave us a food bowl, dog treats, and doggy poop bags and holder. That alone was worth the extra $10 for bringing a pet. We weren't ever asked what breed of dog we had which made us feel even more welcome (lot's of people discrimate against our dog because of how he looks). Being in a pet room, I admit we weren't expecting it to be very nice but we have no complaints about the condition! The beds were comfortable and the pillows were amazing. I acutally want to get the same kind for my bed at home!! Our Christmas party always has delicous food for dinner. Shelly's restaurant was great for breakfast. Everyone was friendly and helpful. A few minor things we had problems with: -Interior signage was nonexistant. We weren't the only ones randomly walking up and down the halls trying to figure out how to get to the banquet rooms from our room or to a friends room. -The thermostat in our room didn't have temperatures on it. Just ""warmer"" and ""cooler""; which was quite annoying trying to get a nice temperature when we didn't plan on being in the room long enough to figure out what it needed to be set at until we were coming back to sleep. (The room was quite cool when we first arrived). -When we checked out, the bill was more than what I was quoted when I booked the room. I pointed this out to the front desk clerk and it was changed to what I was quoted but I have read complaints about this same thing so I wasn't impressed. I had communicated via e-mail to change my room to the pet friendly room; so maybe I would get the total price quoted via e-mail so I had written proof next time. The good things far out weigh the negative, and over all it was a great night and I'd stay again for sure."
POSITIVE,Everyone at the Golden Buff was willing to help us out with anything we needed. The room was clean. It was in an area that we could walk to restaurants and stores. We were there on business and would stay there again if I return to the area. The Buff restaurant was just as good and friendly. Pros: The people working at the Best Western Golden Buff made us feel comfortable and willing to answer any questions we had.
POSITIVE,WE ENJOYED OUR STAY AT BOTH PLACES. IT WAS THE NICEST WE STAYED AT DURING OUR VACATION.
POSITIVE,Beds were great.
NEUTRAL,"I was in Elkhart for business and chose this hotel for location, price and the fact that sight unseen on-line it seemed a good value for price. The staff is VERY friendly and professional, and the breakfast is better than described on the web site. But travelers do need to be aware that this hotel is a bit worn; the wash cloths were frayed and furniture seemed ""tired"". I elected not to use the in-room whirlpool bath as the nozzles looked black from either mold, or just age. In fact, when I returned to Elkhart at the end of the weekend, I found a better rate at the Hampton Inn, and the rooms were much nicer."
NEUTRAL,"It wasnt a terrible hote, fairly old, and if you book online with hotels.ca you dont get an invoice, which I didnt like because not sure if I was charged the rate quoted by hotels.ca or not."
NEUTRAL,"Cons: The sound proofing is not adequate, as I could hear people talking and snoring in adjacent rooms."
POSITIVE,The hotel staff were friendly. The price was very reasonable. The rooms were very clean. The room it self was dark but it was fine. The beds were comfortable. The only thing that I didn't like was the outside of the hotel it doesnt really match the inside. The outside looks a little old looking but all and all I had a great stay and I wil probably be [?] staying there again.
POSITIVE,Everything was great about this hotel! They made us feel right at home!
POSITIVE,"The hotel is a little older than some but super clean, great location. Jr. suites are a little small but perfect for two people. Quiet area, very close to major highway. Their guest service is great, the free breakfast is really a breakfast and very good, Starbucks coffee too! I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,Love The Best Western accommodations. We were not impressed with the housekeeping performance.
POSITIVE,"The upgrades in the bathroom faucets and shower surround. The white duvet. The cleanliness. If all Best Westerns were equal, I would choose one every time I traveled."
POSITIVE,We stayed here in August. We chose a room on the ground floor which suited our needs however there is alot of noise from the floors upstairs which kept us awake most nights. The airconditioning worked well but was too noisy to leave on at night time. Staff were pleasant and the hotel had a fantastic pool and spa. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.
NEUTRAL,"The toilet of our room was clog one night, the water comes out and leaks... The hotel staff is very helpful and reacts fast, they stopped the water flow and moved us to the only available room in the hotel, which impressed us a lot. Though the room is a little bit old, but the hotel locates just at the highway entrance, there is free parking and complimentry breakfast plus free wifi, I will definitely recommend this hotel."
NEGATIVE,Room window lead to indoor pool = very loud from 8 am to 10 pm. Bathroom (tub) didn'tfeel clean
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at the Seven Oaks Regina Best Western a number of different times. What I have noticed the last few times is that they are starting to do some upgrades to there rooms and hallways. Keep up the good work. Oh, and as always Ricky's Resturant is a great place to eat. Room Tip: Bigger rooms are at the back of the hotel but, you will need to ask for the bigger room."
NEUTRAL,"Didn't realized the area of Regina the hotel is in when reservation was made. When we arrived, we were leary but saw no concerns during our stay. Check in supervisor may have been having a bad day as she was quite loud and in my opinion used some inappropriate phrases in dealing with patrons and check in clerks. Clerk we checked in with, seemed fairly new but he was doing OK. Still the supervisor seemed to closely surpervise the clerks rather than just let them do their job. It seemed the clerk was not allowed to start check in process until she told he could start. Room was spacious and quiet during the night. One side of mattress was lumpy so it may have to be changed. Overall we will consider staying at this hotel again."
POSITIVE,"Very nice place to stay ; close to the outlet mall . Staff were friendly and very helpful. The room next to us was very loud one night but there wasn;t much anyone could do about it. The staff did tell us they were sorry , Would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Bay view is perfect. Free wifi and breakfast. Room walls are ugly white. Internet connection is quite bad, but free."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here because of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. HA HA HA I agree with several previous comments by guests regarding our stay. We also had difficulty using the shower head, the breakfast had less choices each morning of our stay. The therapy pool room was disgusting. I would have rather swam in a pond then in that pool! And I realize the rooms have fired doors but every time someone came or left on our floor you could here the door closing! And the front desk staff hardly had took the time to look up, much less speak with you!"
POSITIVE,Transportation to wdw. Found the building old.
POSITIVE,"Free bus i/f/o hotel to canyon visitors center (5) miles away and free route buses once inside. Hotel good for kids with (6) bowling alleys, pinball machines, pool tables for young and old, and outside pool. Also a great free breakfast soup to nuts, and hotel has (2) restaurants and sports lounge. Tusayan is a small town so these ammenities are great [?] to have on sight.The only problem I had with a friend was clothing space. There was only two dresser draws and small narrow clothes closet with safe on top self. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcases for (5) days. Third floor rooms in some parts ot the hotel had no elevator so baggage have to be schlepped up the stairs. Of course most could put up with these inconveniences so this info is for people who can't. Everything else was fine. Come see the Vegas, Hoover Dam, Grand Canyons, and Historic Route ""66"" another great 50's retro side trip in to time!!!"
POSITIVE,Knowledgeable staff Nice room good restaurant close to the Grand Canyon Visitors Center
POSITIVE,Excellent hotel for family with kids. Has an arcade and bowling alley. Food is great and the complimentary breakfast is awesome.
NEGATIVE,"When I stayed at our local Best Western I was disappointed with the smell of my room. Given it was a smoking room I just feel as though more could be done to ""freshen it up"" I also woke up and called the front desk there was a potato bug in my bed. As well when I got in the shower there was a smooshed and smeared mosquito on the shower wall. It is obvious that the house keeping staff just doesn't have enough time to do a sufficient job, I feel bad for that. Room Tip: Ask to view the room before you commit"
POSITIVE,"Pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Older hotel but clean, well maintained, comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. Continental in the morning was standard but was surprised to see baked beans as an option. Not something that I usually have for breakfast but not bad. I thought the highway noise would keep me up but I really did not hear it. I would stay again the price was right."
NEUTRAL,Good breakfast + hudge king size bed A little bit far from downtown if you have no car
NEUTRAL,"No hot water in the morning, did not get the reserved room, did not get an additional blanket after we called three times, very good breakfast."
NEUTRAL,"I have stayed at this hotel at least 3 times in about 5 years. They have made some upgrades but the hotel on a whole is not keeping up with the new modern hotels in the area. Room was clean but smelled of smoke, in non-smoking room, one day the room service did not come, and it was very loud another night when the hotel was full. The rooms are a good rate but has substandard service. Will be looking to stay somewhere else in my future trips to the area."
NEGATIVE,"This property is not deserving of the Best Western name. We found the following defects: No breakfast; yet they imply on their web site that they have a free breakfast as other Best Westerns. This is deceptive, unethical and fraudulent. We checked in at 6 p.m. and found this out at 9 p.m. My wife was tired so we stayed. The old Tv did not work. Another customer complained when I checked in. We called the front desk and it was over an hour before the overworked clerk came to get it barely working. The internet speed tested was 1 GB, then 5; but it was extremely slow. Things I downloaded at home in 25 seconds said 6 to 12 minutes. I want a full refund for lack of service. I have been a Best Western fan before this episode. I have a hunch any Best Western that does not serve breakfast is sub-standard in all services. They are merely taking advantage of the brand signature and misleading customers for personal gain. I am writing this from a Super Eight motel in Castlegar that has a plasma TV, fast internet, clean rooms and breakfast. I passed up two Best Westerns that did not serve breakfast and will never stay at one that misuses the brand name. Lew"
POSITIVE,"I stay at this Best Western every time I visit my son at TCU, which is only 11 miles away. While not in the middle of downtown Ft. Worth, it is very convenient to shopping and dining. Also, the gas in this area is generally quite a bit cheaper than in other parts of Ft. Worth. The rooms are clean and spacious. The breakfast has a very good selection and is available longer than at many other hotels. The front desk staff is outstanding! Rick is always very helpful and accommodating. You can't beat this hotel for the cost and quality."
NEUTRAL,"The best thing this hotel had going for it was the close proximity to Little Italy. We asked for a non smoking room and whilst that was given to us it certainly didn't smell like non smoking. The breakfast that was included in the rate was appaling! We weren't expecting much but a bit of toast and a coffee would have satisfied us, the bay maries were [?] empty of which we could see from others plates had been bacon, eggs, pancakes, perhaps sausages... There was no hot water in the urns to even have a coffee and we could not find a knife to even spread butter on the toast we had made. On the way in we were told we could only sit at the bar stool tables on bar stools, not even at the dining room tables. We attempted to spread our toast and gave up and went over the road for breakfast. After we had finished there and walked back past the bayside inn we could still see the remains of our attempted breakfast on the table inside, it hadn't even been cleaned up yet after approx half an hour or more. If you do stay here go to Little Italy for dinner, it was fantastic!"
POSITIVE,"I got a 12th floor room facing the city (east). Room was clean and bed was comfortable. I used the fridge to cool my drinks and it works just fine. A slight hum from central cooling but it's tolerable. I was there for a week but did not use any of the daily cleaning service by preference, but I was given anything I asked for - soaps, towels, etc. Old [?] school CRT in the room but watchable. High pressure water for hot showers. I took advantage of the complimentary shuttle to the airport (5-10 min) - a nice feature for me. Wireless was terrible in my room but works fine at the lobby. That's my biggest complaint - if you want internet - stay at the lower floors."
POSITIVE,"I cannot compliment your staff enough, especially Cody Beck. He was exceptionally courteous and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable & the coffee was great. I was in town for a funeral, needless to say a last minute trip and very sad occasion for me. Your staff went out of their way to make sure that although my visit was not for pleasure, it was a very pleasant stay. I will certainly use this hotel if I ever return to Evansville."
POSITIVE,"We had an excellent 2-night stay at the Dry Creek Inn. The Tuscan Rooms are gorgeous and the hot tubs, pools, and breakfast are also very nice. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful with winery tasting coupons etc. Room Tip: East end of Tuscan bldg by water fountain for pleasant white noise."
POSITIVE,The staff were very friendly. The room was clean and the air quality was excellent.
POSITIVE,Location was the biggest concern having never been to Nashville before. Hotel was close to shopping & restaurants. Staff was very helpful in getting us transportation so we did not have to drive to the places we wanted to see. Continential breakfast was great. All in all a great place to stay.
POSITIVE,"I've stayed in Napa and Callistoga many times, but this was my first time going further north to Healdsburg. We had a wonderful time in the area. The hotel is VERY reasonably priced for the area. Yes, it is your standard Best Western, but the employees and service were fantastic. It's nice to know that you can find a friendly, clean, and comfortable place to stay and not pay an arm and a leg. We only grabbed coffee from the breakfast buffet, because we heard such wonderful things about some of the downtown restaurants (all true), but it was great to have it available. We also didn't partake of the free shuttle to and from the casino, but that's a wonderful amenity as well."
POSITIVE,"Ashley and I had a wonderful experience at the Dry Creek Inn. We stayed in the Tuscanny Suites building with fireplace, double jet tub, patio, and flat screen with stereo. Includes the typical continental plus breakfast. Highly recommend when visiting Healdsburg. Close to town and easy access off of the 101 freeway. Happy New Year! Room Tip: Definitiely stay in the Tuscanny Section."
NEGATIVE,"No restaurant. No service and Rude. No Free Hot Breakfast. NO floors, just a Parking Lot. I called to make a reservation and I was told by the manager that this was a full service non-smoking Best Western and that my room would be on the 1st floor. There is no 1st floor, this is an old motel in a giant, empty parking lot. All of the rooms face the parking lot and all of the doors to the rooms open onto the parking lot. They were rude and combative when I said this motel was not as described. They charged my credit card even though I did not stay there. They told me on the phone they had a full hot breakfast but what they have is a coffee and donut type area in the small lobby. I had to dispute the charge on my credit card. See pictures I took of the motel. Room Tip: Keep going down the Interstate to another location. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Service
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for one night. It is a very small room, but it was clean and the staff was very nice and the location can't be beat if you want to be on Front St. The lanai is large and comfortable and looks out on the action. Beware that the louvred bathroom door allows little privacy and that you will hear the street noise until around 1am and that it will start again early in the morning. We would stay again. Room Tip: The quietest rooms have the ""pool view"" as the lanai does not face the street. Room 36 has the largest lanai with part facing the park and part facing Front St."
NEUTRAL,"Requested an upgrade and was told that hotel was full. Very doubtful. The first room we had the A/C did not work and the room was smallish and very very dated. We were moved to the type (two double beds) but the room was larger and much more updated. A/C worked. This was an attempt to be ""resort""- had movie theater, bowling alley/restaurant/indoor putt putt golf and convention area. The movie theater only played movies at one time per night. Bowled and played putt putt. I had inquired if it was a full service breakfast--was told yes, it was not but it had very good continental breakfast selection. Asked for sit down restaurants nearby and was directed to fast food down the road--the next exit-- 5 or 6 miles down highway--had real restaurants. Not sure we would chose this hotel again. Does not live up to the Best Western Standards."
POSITIVE,"The receptionist was great, the hotel was good enough for the night we stayed there. We had no problems with the staff at all. Everyone was very friendly to us and greeted us. They even gave us recommendations on where to go in San Diego. The area that it was in was a ok. Not the best but we were only planning to stay there one night so it did the [?] job."
POSITIVE,"Your hotel, even though it is quite old and outdated was very clean and quiet. we enjoyed the restaurant and the service there. Good ocean view from where we were seated."
POSITIVE,"We had a Groupon and booked a night here on our way up the coast. The view was very nice, the beach close by and the breakfast really good. We had our teenage boys with us and they enjoyed the pool. Plenty of space in room and very clean. We'd stay again. Room Tip: Ask for ocean view See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We were so thirsty all night long, the breakfast was only so so. the hotel was clean and the staff very friendly.Pros: Freshly washed bed lines (even the blankets) huge bonus. Cons: Vending machines not working, can't drink the tap water so the machines are very important!"
POSITIVE,"We had a wonderful experience at this Best Western. The staff was very friendly. Our room was just perfect, comfortable bed, full length mirror and big bathroom. The complimentary breakfast was very good, there was a good choice of hot and cold food. We definitely would come back here!"
NEUTRAL,"First: the water in Williams is not potable. I'll get back to that. But no other reviews mentioned it when I was looking up hotels on Trip Advisor. So I wanted to make that point. Our stay here was fine. The room was clean, the staff was helpful, the location was ideal for everything we wanted to do in Williams. (Though Williams is so small it would be tough to find a location that wasn't ideal.) We did have to drive down to downtown Williams, rather than being walking distance from everything there. But we didn't have any problems with that. The one thing that exceeded my expectations was the complimentary breakfast. It was a full hot breakfast including eggs, sausage, and make-your-own waffles. Had all the cold cereal items and obligatory beverages as well. It did seem to lack healthy choices (the only fruit was oranges, there was no yogurt or granola). But other than that, it was great. It was noisier than I expected, and I expect a lot of noise at a family hotel near the Grand Canyon. There's a lounge with live music and if you have a room close to the main entrance, the sound really carries. The music stops at 10pm, but up until then it's annoying. YOU CANNOT DRINK THE WATER IN WILLIAMS. You can bathe in it and wash things in it, but you can't drink it. There's a problem with the water supply that leads to excess manganese and iron in the water supply. This causes seasonal discoloration in the water everywhere in Williams. And the staff at this hotel told us they never drink the water even if it's clear. So be sure to bring bottled water and/or water filters if you decide to stay here. Room Tip: If you need quite early in the evening, request a room away from the lobby."
POSITIVE,The Best Western was very pleasant to stay in. A standard hotel room with a bit more space than some others. The complimentary breakfast was very good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.Pros: The complimentary breakfast was very good - fresh and filling! Cons: The hallways had a musty odor.
NEUTRAL,4 questions ..... Try counting again!
NEUTRAL,Cost; comfortable room Noisy (re: hospitality suite outside of our room); staff dealt with our complaints but it was quite annoying the restaurant wasn't very good although the staff in both the hotel and the restaurant were excellent!
NEUTRAL,"It was close to the downtown area of Burlington and the airport, which is what we were looking for. The staff was polite and helpful. We had a hard time finding the road to turn into the hotel, and to find the front entrance."
POSITIVE,A good and clean hotel near calgary airport.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for 1 night before Thanksgiving while driving through KC to Des Moines. $67 rate through Hotels.com ($78 with tax) is excellent for the Country Club Plaza area. Front desk staff were friendly and efficient (Even if they were on their Facebook page while working:) )Also has free parking and free breakfast! Not a great breakfast, but what do you expect for the price. New bedding was comfortable with 5 pillows on each bed. Small courtyard sitting area behind hotel (with additional parking) looked like a New Orleans style area. Warning for senior or handicapped travelers, the first floor rooms are 6-7 steps above the lobby with no elevator access. Elevator does access other floors. Walking distance to Country Club Plaza about 2-3 blocks away. They offer a free shuttle to County Club Plaza on weekends, but it was not available on Wednesday evening we stayed. 24-hour Quik-Trip (The World's BESTconvenience stores!!) next door was handy for gasoline and anything you need. Would definitely stay again! Room Tip: Warning for senior or handicapped travelers, the first floor rooms are 6-7 steps above the lobby with no elevator access. Elevator does access other floors."
POSITIVE,A couple of my friends and I stayed at this hotel for a ladies getaway. It was beautiful. The bathroom sink is jaw dropping. We loved the location because it was close to the highway and a mall.
NEUTRAL,LOOKS GOOD BUT THEY FORGOT TO CLEAN THE COFFEE MAKER
POSITIVE,"Clean, spacious room...we had two large queen beds plus a pull out sofa bed. Lots of room for a family of four which includes two teenagers. Room had a microwave and fridge. Hotel included continental breakfast ~ waffles, sausages, eggs, biscuits, french toast, cereal, breads, yogurt, fruit...enough to fill your belly to begin your day. Close to walk to many restaurants. Walgreens right outside hotel. We walked to Universal Studios ~about a 10 minute walk but there is a very busy street to cross. Hotel does provide a shuttle to Universal twice in the morning and two pick ups at night. Hotel has laundry facilities and a basic workout room. We would definitely stay here again. One of the cleanest hotels we have been at."
NEGATIVE,In town for a family funeral and had very nice service when we got there late to check in. Stepped into the room and it smelled like someone had died there!lol Was moved to a better room very quickly though. But the beds were the WORST my wife and I have ever had to sllep on! Our antique rope bed we had when we got married was more comfortable! I wish I had slept in the car! Without an elevator the 1st floor was actually up a flight of stairs so in order to carry your bags up. Thankfully we were not on the 2nd floor! Saw the front desk clerk that morning looking like he had slept in a barn. Room at the end of the hall had door propped open and it looked like someone needed to call the new show on tv called hoarders! We told the family and we all got 4 rooms in another hotel somewhere else in town.
POSITIVE,"Compimentary Breakfast, nice rooms"
POSITIVE,"Due to a last minute change of plans, I grabbed a sweet priceline deal here as I was waiting to board a late flight from LAX to SFO. Honestly, I was desperate for a place to stay and not sure what to expect. The property is very convenient to SFO and has frequent shuttle service. After arriving at the hotel around 1130pm, I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I stepped off the shuttle. Reminiscent of the motels I remember from cross country trips in the 70's the Best Western El Rancho Inn has been beautifully maintained and updated in every way. The room is clean, comfortable and well-appointed with relaxing decor and offers free internet. The king size bed has crisp clean sheets. The embroidered labels on the pillows, ""soft"" and ""firm"" are something I've only seen in upscale hotels. The bathroom is spotlessly clean and updated. The exterior grounds are nicely landscaped and maintained. Planning to be in the City by mid morning, it was convenient to take the hotel shuttle back to the airport to take BART. (The Millbrae BART station is less than a one mile walk from the hotel) Having to leave at 730 in the morning, my only disappointment was that my stay was too short."
POSITIVE,"For a budget-priced hotel, this is one of the best I've encountered anywhere. The restaurant is excellent, even compared to luxury hotels. A great experience Pros: Restaurant, cleanliness. They even sterilize the tv remote. Staff is very friendly. Cons: Small exercise room."
POSITIVE,"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We had a room near the main street and it wasn't noisy at all. Parking was good though the hotel was not busy at this time so I don't know how it would be in the summer. Breakfast was very good though I would have preferred it changed up a little bit. But there were enough choices from sausage and eggs, waffles, cereal, bagels, muffins, toast, etc that we did still had plenty of variety. Breakfast area was roomy also.Room was clean, staff very helpful. We had two teenager girls and the room was plenty big enough for the 4 of us. I would definately stay here again. My only complaint is that there is no snack machine in this hotel and there is no drug store nearby. Your only choice is to go the the liquor store across the street. If eating in the area you can walk to Bob's Big Boy, Subway, Chipoltle, and a really good italian restaurant whose name I cannot remember (Reno's maybe). Taco Bell around the corner... Pros: Complimentary breakfast, refrig and microwave in room. Cons: No snack machine, only soda. Location: Much less chaotic than the hollywood area, practically walking distance to Warner Bros, 10 min drive to Hollywood Blvd, 5 min to Universal Studios."
POSITIVE,Pros: Close to Urban outfitters and a short cab ride away from Broadway.. Cons: Not the nicest interior but adequate. Thought my teens would complain but both said they wanted to stay here next time.
POSITIVE,"I travel with a dog, and Best Western has always been able to give me a room across the hall from the elevator or near an exit door on the first floor. I stayed during a volley ball tournament and was surprised at how quiet my room was. Very comfy bed and plenty of pillows. Decor a nice contemporary style. I'm never up for breakfast so I can't review that. Easy on & off I-90. Room Tip: My room was right across the hall from an elevator and yet was very quiet."
POSITIVE,"I stay for a week on a business travel, and I took this time to fill the comments, because I felt really comfortable at the hotel. The location had an extra value, the rate is fare and the rooms are what you need on a days of meetings. I canÂ´t forget to name the great service for the housekeepers, a really kind staff and the room was always in perfect shape."
POSITIVE,"The accommodation is very good, the beds very comfortable and rooms are a good size. There is a pool which is part inside and part outside, making it ideal for all seasons. This hotel is positioned within walking distance of Galena (down a hill) , which is a beautiful, interesting old town with many original buildings dating from the 1800s. If you walk into town, you can visit the former home of President U.S.Grant on the way, or at least view it from outside. Galena has wonderful unusual shops and many restaurants and is well worth a visit."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for a quick family getaway weekend. It is in a great location a short drive from the historic district. The hotel was mostly booked on the weekend we were in town, but there were still a couple of suites left. The slightly higher cost was not a deal-breaker, because it was still a bit of a bargain. We found the staff to be family and pet- friendly. The cute wicker basket of snacks and bottled water delivered to the room were a nice surprise. The note said to enjoy the snacks but just leave the basket. :)"
POSITIVE,"Great location if you are planning to go to a Mariners or Seahawks game, within walking distance. Also the Underground tour is close by. Hotel staff was very friendly. Beautiful character hotel, originally buildt in 1914, and has been beautifully restored."
POSITIVE,"We stayed in Best Western Woodhaven Inn because we wanted to go to the MGM Grand casino on New Year's Eve. MGM Grand's rates are quite expensive so we searched for an alternative and Best Western Woodhaven Inn was a good one we found. It is about 15 miles from downtown Detroit. The room is a nice size with a queen bed, LCD TV, small and clean bathroom. [?] Our only complaint is the spotty wi-fi internet."
POSITIVE,"Pool was nice, Drinks expensive. Long lines at Breakfast. Good Location Hotel was nice and the grounds were great. Kids loved walking to the beach. The only problem was it is a pet friendly hotel, and a large dog under us barked till 10pm, constantly, I called the desk, and they did nothing. Then the dog decided to start barking at 7am .. desk did nothing again, and at check out said nothing.."
POSITIVE,This hotel was fabulous! I couldn't believe how nice it was for the price. We had breakfast every morning in a much larger seating area than most hotels with free continental breakfast. The location was amazing. It literally is across the street from the main entrance of Universal Studios. Our only mishap came from the height of the beds. Our 4-yr old fell off the bed the first night and climbed on a chair to try to get back up because he couldn't do it himself. He had a small palette on the floor after that. Will definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"It's already been about 3 weeks and I like to include more detail than this, so I apologize in advance. My main impression as I was there was that alot of the glowing reviews were because of the bar on site. Alcohol tends to improve the opinion of many. That being said, once I got over a slight letdown (I don't drink), I was very pleased with the motel. The beds were comfortable, the service was kind and considerate, the room was recently remodeled and had a large flat panel TV. The pool was decent and small as they usually are at Motor Inns. Even with the Tulare early morning farm odor that permeates the area most days, the value trumps it and we would stay here again for a quick, easy, cheap motor stop. We also recently stayed at the Quality Inn Tulare and the Charter Inn Tulare. All 3 are superior and can be trusted. I rank Charter #1, Best Western (this one) #2, and Quality #3. All 3 were good enough to be tops for me."
POSITIVE,Everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We want to stay there the next visit to new orleans. Thank you so much. Mike & judy whitney
POSITIVE,The stay at Best Western was great. The location of hotel was very convenient for freeway access. The beds were very comfortable. Will stay there again.
NEUTRAL,"Hotel is dated but acceptable. Electrical outlets could use some work. On check-in was greeted with I'm having computer problems, be with you in 5 minutes. Hard to get to because of construction on the Neponset bridge, make sure you study your directions. Pub area was in need of some updating. We were wakened by loud guests in the hallway after midnight. The sounds from the hallway were the loudest I've ever experienced in a hotel. Not sure whether it was thin doors or thin walls. Breakfast was good as was the coffee. Free WiFi, although a little slow, is always a plus. The shuttle service worked well for us both ways. The van was clean and the drivers were polite. On our arrival back to Logan we called for the shuttle (after we got our luggage). They told us it would be there to pick us up in 25 minutes and that's exactly what it took. When we got back to our car in the hotel's parking lot our rear license plate was partially ripped off. Not sure whether someone tried to rip it off or if another vehicle accidentally clipped the rear of our car. I would guess the former because there was no other damage to the car. I would definitely consider staying here again when flying out of Boston but would hesitate leaving a car I value there.. Room Tip: Ask for a room with a water view."
POSITIVE,"We (2 adults, 3 children) stayed at this hotel for five nights and were completely impressed. We had a two bedroom corner apartment which had a washer/dryer, full kitchen, two bathrooms, kitchen, living room on the 21st floor. Terrific amount of space for the three children. The suite was excellent, everything was spotlessly clean, the beds extremely comfy. no noise from neighbouring rooms although we could hear some machine from the top of the building. The kids loved it, everything from the class elevator, to the outside hallways enchanted them on the way down to the beach and pools. The pool area was busy, during the week they had an activity team that was engaging the kids with different things, sea shell painting was one of the highlight. Wednesday there was a kids night out ($15 a child) which the kids begged to go on and thoroughly enjoyed from 5:30 to 8:30. The hotel included a lot as part of the package the following which we took advantage of. 1.)breakfast for two each day across the street, as there were 5 in our party we didn't go everyday but were able to combine the vouchers to go twice during the week... 2.)Wild Wheels Water park - we got 5 free passes to this waterpark, excellent value I think it would have cost us $120 to get in otherwise. They have a bus that will take you there on certain days. The kids loved this place. 3.)Mini Golf - just across the street from the hotel next door. Unlimited play between 1 and 7 each day. When you check in they try and get you to attend a time share presentation at the hotel next door which we declined and were not asked again at any other part of our trip. We all thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. The only item to point out that wasn't very good was the WiFi, on the 21st floor the signal would only occasionally work near the windows. Other than that everything was excellent."
POSITIVE,"We were @ the Best Western for a family reunion. The staff was wonderful ,helpful and friendly. The hotel provided free passes to the water park daily. The hotel is right on the beach. The children had alot of activities to do no one was bored. We will be using The Best Western again. Room Tip: I would suggest getting the balcony suite its has a lot of room."
POSITIVE,"Great time, Great service, Best sleep I have had in a hotel at the beach ever! The staff there was friendly and courteous. The only negative was a worn out sofa and dvd player that worked when it wanted to. Overall stay was a pleasant experience."
POSITIVE,"Without a doubt, one of the finest locations we've ever stayed at. We left the door to the balcony open at night and slept with the sound of surf lulling us to sleep. Staffed by helpful and friendly people, it was more than we expected when we booked on line. Only improvement they could possibly make would be an on site restaurant/lounge."
POSITIVE,"Always a reliable place to stay, close to everything there is to do in Myrtle Beach. Can not wait to return. Great value in off season. Minor complaints on furniture being scratched or torn, but a comfortable place for the money and great views of the ocean. Guest services always a help."
POSITIVE,"As always a great stay. Had some noisy neighbors, but not hotels fault. Close to everything wer needed and extremely courteous and friendly staff. Restaurant was good, food and service. Will stay again for sure Room Tip: We were on the space needle side and you get a little noise but great view. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel, with a view of the Space Needle. The hotel is a little older, but it is well maintained. Our room had middle aged furniture in good condition. Parking was $15 per night, worth it because it is a locked lot underneath the building. The surrounding neighborhood appears safe in the daytime. On one night a 2:30AM, someone was talking loudly on the street, not the hotel's fault. We did not try the breakfast buffet at $7.50 per person, but we heard from other guests that it was pretty good. We slept soundly in a comfortable bed and woke up each morning in a good mood. When we checked in, we arrived a little early--1:30PM. The desk clerk, David, told me that the room was not ready yet, would probably not be ready for another hour, and might not be ready until 4PM. Taken aback, I told him we would return. I discussed the situation with my wife and we decided that we would cancel the reservation and book a room somewhere else. When I returned to the front desk, I was greeted by a female clerk as David was busy with someone else. I explained to her that I was cancelling my 3 day reservation and that I would find another hotel that has a room ready. Within 30 seconds, she offered me a room with two queen beds in place of the reserved room of one king bed at the same rate. Not really wanting to look for another room at the last minute on a Saturday, we accepted the substitute. While our stay was satisfactory, we may sample the competition next time. I can never understand why the management of some hotels do not provide adequate training to the employees. Perhaps they have so much business that they don't need return guests. Apparently, management does not understand that travelers have enough aggravation finding the hotels that they don't need aggravation from a desk clerk! Room Tip: Make a reservation in advance and don't show up until 4PM. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was fine except I thought the bed was too firm and pillows almost hard. The Space needle was right across from our window. Pretty neat, especially at night."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel has a decent location and the river is pretty awesome. But the rooms are way out dated. They seem clean enough but I still had that I can't wait to get home and take a shower feeling. It reminded me of visiting my grandparents farm. The bed was musty which was the worst part. The bathroom is really cramped. They did have what looked like a fun indoor pool for kids though we didn't use it. The reservation people seemed overwhelmed but the smallest of things. The snacks lady was rude and all we got were stale chex mix, sausage, and cheese which tasted like they'd been on the plate for a couple of hours. I wouldn't stay here again. Room Tip: This hotel has been added onto so you may want to ask about what is newer."
POSITIVE,"I had points from a boutique hotel I stayed in from another country so I had this for free so I cannot complain about price--otherwise it seems to be a bit high for the value. It is a family- run business which is really nice..decent free breakfast...a bit industrial location unless you walk the 10 blocks to the subway. The ""gym"" is way too small (1 treadmill squeezed into a room) and the rooms have been updated."
POSITIVE,"Location, Cleanliness, and amenities! The restrooms could use minor updating but overall very clean!!! Next to everything! We had a great stay, close to everything. The amenities were definitely a plus!!! We will come back for sure!"
POSITIVE,"We had several criteria for choosing a hotel for our recent family holiday. Even though a small fee was charged for parking, it was nominal, considering that we didn't have to drive a distance and pay for parking. Location is an easy walk a few blocks away from Seattle Centre/Space Needle in one direction and Pike Place Market in the other plus the free bus system is only a couple of blocks down. Service is the tops, especially by Maria who deserves a medal for juggling so many tasks and still being helpful to everyone asking for assistance. We arrived a little earlier than check in time, but were able to get into our room even though the hotel was crazy busy. Rooms are on the small side, but super clean with a bar size fridge that kept our water and drinks cold, and wifi access. Air conditioning was a little noisy, but worked well. Continental breakfast had lots to choose from both hot and cold. The neighborhood was a little sketchy, but felt safe. A couple of blocks up you will find a Walgreens for snacks and any other trip necessities. Everything about the Loyal Inn, including the reasonable price makes this is an ideal place to stay in Seattle. We'll be back again. Room Tip: Ask for a room at the back if you want a little quiet. See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,Room smelt musty--non-smoking--but may have been smoking in the past. Linens need updating--not sure if bedspread etc. was as clean as it could have been. Jacuzzi sprayed water all over the room when turned on
POSITIVE,I picked this hotel mainly because of the location. I could walk to the Georgia Aquarium/CocaCola/CNN in about 8 mins. Atlantic Station and IKEA was only a 5 min drive away and the zoo was about a 12 min drive. The room was clean and very cute. The staff was friendly and they offered a pretty good breakfast in the morning. Parking was $15. I suggesting parking in their deck under the hotel rather than the gravel lot behind it. You save $5-10 but I witnessed a car hit another parked car and drive off. Lot did not look safe.
POSITIVE,"Comfortable beds. Walls are a little bit thin, but area was generally quiet over a 10 night stay. Located between some car dealerships and a residential neighborhood in East Poway. Very central to places to eat or shop. Great little hotel in a safe part of Poway. Good value for the money, friendly staff. Rooms are small and basic, but always clean, well stocked, and the beds very comfortable."
POSITIVE,"I came into the hotel a little earlier than the regular check in time. I was given a room with no fuss or quarrel about the early hour. The room was clean, and I appreciated the climate control. I felt safe, and cared for. Also, the morning I was waiting for the shuttle to the airport the hotel clerk put together a little brown bag breakfast for each [?] of us. It was very nice."
POSITIVE,"Upon checking in, I thought the ""older"" looking lady would not be helpful. On the contrary: she was quick, sharp, very helpful, great on the computer skills, and tried several things to help us. She even gave us her recommendation for dinner! The room was large, clean, and had wonderful refrigerator for no extra charge. Cute little pool, although with several children in it, we didn't swim. Very comfortable bed, which is so important in traveling."
POSITIVE,Whilst touring Vancouver Island my wife and I spent 2 nights at the Westerly Hotel having booked on line from the UK. The Westerly certainly exceeded our expectations. It was easy to find and nothing was too much trouble for the staff who made us feel very welcome. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The food - we ate breakfast and dinner in the hotel on both days of our stay - was excellent as was the choice of venues for our evening meal. Both check in and check out was effortless. If you're planning to visit Courtenay then look no further than The Westerly Hotel as it provides excellent accommodation at a good price
NEUTRAL,"The best way I can describe this hotel is reasonable. The price was reasonable, the beds were reasonable, it was a reasonable amount of distance to various attractions. There's nothing really special about this place but it wasn't bad either. The price and breakfast is probably about the best things about it. It was clean enough. The beds weren't super comfortable but we made it through the night. The heat and air was kind of annoying because it didn't kick on and off automatically so it seemed like it was really hot or really cold. The free breakfast made up for anything that might have seemed less than great. The breakfast is in the cutest little restaurant. They give you a menu with food items to choose from. They were biscuits and gravy; bacon, eggs (cooked to order) and toast; pancakes. It came with juice AND coffee. You could add various items for extra and very reasonable prices. The best part about breakfast was you have a waitress!! How nice is that extra! No waiting in the line for the free breakfast!! Great for parents with little ones!! Our waitress was very nice! It was an overall pretty good stay!! We had a large group and they were even willing to help us all get rooms by eachother and they didn't complain about it! Tip: There is one part of the hotel with doors on the inside and one part looks older with doors on the outside. I didn't see the older part but if it makes you feel more comfortable to have doors on the inside you might request it when your making reservations. We weren't told there were any difference in rooms. Also we had 4 couples traveling together and they gave us a small discount on our rooms so if you have a large group you might ask if they could give a discount."
NEGATIVE,"Parking is terrible , Hotel is older but decent . Not in the best part of town . (Seems to be tho , but a homeless person wandered in ,kinda hung around ) AND elevator got stuck for 45 minutes AND NO ONE SEEMED TO GIVE A DAMN !!Three hours later still not working !! Sleep in car or go to homeless shelter !! Room Tip: Others close by . Suggest Hampton Inn . Better part of town ."
POSITIVE,"The breakfast was depressing. No fresh fruit to speak of, coffee was terrible. Pros: easy to get to Cons: breakfast and coffee"
POSITIVE,Great location very close to downtown Palm Springs. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was very nice. Would stay there again.
POSITIVE,Everything was excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room I had was very large and the bed was very comfortable. The refrigerator was larger than most motels have. This was my second stay here and will always stay there when I'm in Ellensburg. The motel sets back off of Canyon Road so very little traffic noise. There is a popular restaurant within walking distance.
NEUTRAL,"The towels smelled terrible, like some cheap disinfectant or fabric softener. I could not even use the towels.Pros: Close to freeway and downtown. Cons: The towels smelled terrible, like some cheap disinfectant or fabric softener."
NEUTRAL,The night we arrived we were given a room that smelled dirty. I complained and was immediately changed to a room that looked and felt clean and witha better view in a higher floor. The elevators stunk but when we complained again someone was sent immediately to remedy it. When I had trouble connecting to internet someone came immediately to help me [?] resolve this sit. Every one at the receptions desk was polite and helpful and the porters seemed friendly and helpful as well. Although the lobby is a little old fashioned and dark is still overall a comfortable hotel which allowed us to simply walk to most things we wanted to see. I would definitely recommend it!
POSITIVE,"The hotel was perfectly fine. Unfortunately I needed to extend the stay. Over the phone no rooms were available; arriving at the hotel at night an additional rate was 2x the hotel.com rate. I was told I could come back the next morning and by then they added another USD 30.00 to that rate. Not sure, if this is normal. But you better make sure, how long [?] you want to stay, before you arrive."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is one of the best places I've stayed at --- mainly because of the friendly and courteous front desk staff. The hotel itself is simple and clean, and the staff really excel in making guests feel comfortable and welcome. Their helpfulness is second to none in my book. My car broke down on the way to the hotel and they allowed me to cancel my reservation without penalty when I was forced to stay elsewhere on the first night. They also offered to allow me to keep my car at their hotel until I could find a service shop to bring it to, and offered to help me find a suitable shop, too! When I did eventually get to the hotel, they were superb from start to finish, even covering my cab from the airport. Their staff is awesome, and not snobby or condescending like you might find at some so-called upscale hotels."
POSITIVE,"Bien situ, hotel moyen, bon service. Liked: Service"
POSITIVE,"This joint seemed to have the combo of a good price while still being a nice place. Reserved at BW's site, all went fine. Friendly people at the front desk. We had a 2 queen deluxe room which gave us a couple hundred more square feet with a couch and extra table. Room was clean, some signs of wear like torn carpet at the entrance. Older 25"" TV with lots of channels. WiFi was fine. New A/C was very effective but loud, typical Amana - can't seem to get away from them. Bathroom bright, spacious and clean. No hint of smoke smell anywhere that my schnozz detected. Room was quiet except A/C & dark. Pool area clean, hot tub hot, pool cold. Breakfast typical. Waffles, donuts, bagels, cereal and juice. Not enough room to sit if the place is busy which it wasn't. But again, typical. Most of the chains like this were more bucks. I've stayed in a couple of the others, they didn't offer any advantages. Do like the Chase Suites but they were booked and had outdoor pool."
POSITIVE,"We traveled to Plymouth to have Thanksgiving Dinner at the Plymouth > Plantation. > We arrived a day early to see the Mayflower and stayed at the Best Western > Cold Spring. > The room we had was clean and quiet and up to date. It had a small > refrigerator and microwave as well as a TV in each room and Internet access. > In the main room there were two queen beds, with a pull out in the second > room of the suite.

POSITIVE,"Had to get a room at short notice & called around to see where I could just flop my head down for the night at 2:30 a.m., & the HI Express wanted $159, Comfort Inn was full, so I called the old Holiday Inn that's been converted to Best western in the last couple of years I guess. Their rate was $114, so I booked it thinking, ""well it's gotta be close to 50 years old, but I'm so tired, I really need to sleep."" Room had a king size bed, (think they may have even upgraded me to a executive room), had a mini fridge, microwave, & a big comfortable bed. It is a 2 floor hotel, & no elevator that I couild see or was pointed out to me (in case stairs are an issue to you). Bathroom was a fair size, (laso had another sink/mirror outside the bathroom, which comes in very handy when travelling with the signiciant other, and/or kids. What struck me was how clean it was, I expected it to be showing it's age, & while it may not have been brand new, it was maybe the cleanest room I'd ever been in. Good to know for any of you that are ""clean o phobes"". Only negative comment was after I had grabbed the newspaper out of the hall floor outside my door in the morning I didn't replace the privacy lock bar (that keeps even staff with a key from entering), & around 10:30 a.m., a fellow (who I assumed worked there) walked into the room (no knock that I heard) & when I said ""hello, what are you doing in here?"", he asked if I had ordered a crib to be delivered as ""they had sent him up to deliver one."" I told him no, he apologized & when I left an hour or so later, the crib was in the hallway out the room across from mine, so not sure what had happened. Despite that, i'd definitely stay here again & recommend it, is right off the highway, handy to a Costco, Montanas, Perkins & small mall, & was very, very clean."
POSITIVE,"Overall, a great stay and I would return and recommend to family and friends. The only issue I had was the in-room safe was not working and i was offered a safe box at the front desk which I was not comfortable with using. Pros: Quiet, clean, convenient to restaurants and bars in the area Cons: The in-room safe was not working Location: Right off the freeway, easy access"
POSITIVE,"Hotel has been recently updated, rooms are spacious and well kept. Staff was friendly and breakfast is more than adequate. Very nice pool for kids. We stayed here and went to Saratoga which is 15 minutes from here at a fraction of saratoga hotels. Price is right and will go again without hesitation. Room Tip: Online at BW website was the best price, no need to"
POSITIVE,We went to Boulder for a college visit. The hotel was conveniently located close to the campus. It was only about a 10 minute walk to the campus. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room seemed small but had everything we needed. Breakfast was decent and there was always plenty to choose from.
POSITIVE,"Room was clean, service was helpful, price was very reasonable, and the location meant I could walk everywhere I needed to go."
POSITIVE,"Apart from from the poor attitude from the afternoon check in clerk (long blonde hair, mole on chin) this was a great stay. Excellent value. Close enough, yet far enough from Bourbon street. Good breakfast, and beautifully re-finished rooms. I would stay here again. Don't let one miserable receptionist taint this hotel (alnost did for me), the others were excellent and made you feel welcome. Very clean. Great location."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very good with very friendly professional staff, especially Veronica. I was provided breakfast during my four day stay. The coffee was probably the worst dish water I have ever tasted. Although the room was cleaned thoroughly each day, the carpeting needed to be steam cleaned. The dust was so thick it changed color, wherever the vacuum didn't reach."
POSITIVE,"Yes, that's right, a 5 Star quality and value hotel that I don't want you to stay at! Forget about the old fashioned genuine HOSPITALITY - like the perfect reception and friendly reception from Veronica, who handed my special requests with unrivalled accompdation. Dismiss from your evaluation the spacious, luxuriously furnished 2 double bed suites with refrigerator, microwive, flat panel TV, comfy beds and super luxury towels and linnwns, you really don't want to stay here. And I'm sure you wouldn't enjoy the delicious breakfast buffet, and the ultra attentive service by Brenda, who will always take those extra steps to make sure your stay is a singularly pleasant experience. Yes it does have a magnificent outdoor pool, and one of the best Italian restaurants in the country right next to the registration desk - just don't stay here, please don't go to their website and get those rediculiously low rates. PLEASE DON'T BOOK one of their 49 suites, because if you do, O won't be able to return to the BEST hotel and Best bargain in central Arkansas."
POSITIVE,"My Wife & I stayed here with another couple for an awards ceremony back in the spring. The hotel staff were very friendly & the rooms were clean. The breakfast the next morning was very good, especially the waffle maker! After we left I realized I left my cell phone on the bed & called the hotel. The checked the room & called me back immediately when they found it. I asked if they could mail it to me & to just charge my credit card. I received the phone 3 days later & they never did charge me for the extra service. I'm very grateful to the staff for their honesty & helpfulness. We will definitely stay there again if in the area."
POSITIVE,"Arrived in pouring rain but door to door shuttle service was wonderful. Beds were very comfy and room was clean and quiet. Short walking distance to shopping and meals. Stayed one night before our cruise. Hot breakfast and shuttle to cruise port were also included. We were given a free drink coupon for the pool side tiki bar. Even in the pouring rain it was a friendly place. This is not the Ritz, but I have no complaints. I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,Stayed only one night here wish I had booked for more. Room so comfortable overlooking pool. Staff really friendly and helpful pool lovely and good price for room.
POSITIVE,"My wife and i stopped in Palm Springs on our way home from AZ. The Best Western was the perfect place to stay. The staff at the front desk were warm and helpful, the room was beautiful with greg decor and a nice flat screen, the location across from the city center garage meant that everything downtown was an easy walk and the breakfast was delicious. A very nice lady provided made-to-order omelets, fresh muffins and surpassingly good coffee. You can eat in the dining room or sit out in the beautiful pool area if the weather allows. Highly recommended for a quick stopover at a reasonable price!"
POSITIVE,"The view of the mountains The food The service The free beer and wine The pillows The blood stain on the rug AMAZING!!!!! what a view of what makes Arizona so beautiful The staff was very helpful and had great costumer service skills. The breakfast was delicious and the social hour was awesome... a lot of fun. The only bad thing I have to say is that I found a blood stain on the rug, that's why I gave cleanliness a 3.Overall, great experience and a confortable stay."
POSITIVE,"We found the Kokopelli Lodge to be an absolute pleasure in which to stay while on the road. The staff is very friendly and made our stay delightful. Well-kept, clean, attractive, and a great breakfast! Will definitely stay there again when the need arises."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is very good located, the room is very comfortable and very good designed. The desk people are very friendly. Unfortunately I am experiencing problem with the billing. The hotel has charged me twice and I have difficulties and reaching the manager to cler this particular matter. So the reachibilty of the staff especially when you are in New York is very poor."
NEUTRAL,"First off, the staff was wonderful and very customer service focused. There was a mix up with our reservation and that was handled very efficiently. Staff regularly asked if there was anything else they could help with. I was a little disappointed with the room. I'm picky when it comes to cleaning details. The raceway that held computer cables above the bottom moulding of the room was black with filth (but now cleaned by me with lysol wipes) and the wall paper peeling in places. However, the places that really needed to be clean were....the bathroom, microwave and frig were spotless. The carpet was odd in the room we were in - it was indoor outdoor. I noticed friends in other rooms had regular carpet. The bed is comfortable but like most hotels they are using those small square pillows - it's hard to get comfortable with those. However, the room was very very reasonably priced and I would recommend the hotel to others. We also ate at the Perkins. Very busy place - food the quality of a Dennys and priced reasonably. Room Tip: If you are on the ground floor, if your room is near the stairs - it will be noisy! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Stayed over Thanksgiving Holidays and found the accommodations to be clean and average decor and space for 2 queen beds. They did not have a king available for our entire stay. Heidi at the front desk was a delight and helpful. The main drawback was the noise of the subway system that took several days to grow accustomed to. We had our car and thus didn't use the mass transportation but it was close to catch if you needed it.
POSITIVE,"The room was pleasant, clean, and had everything we needed. Breakfast was right across the hall and the staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you!"
NEGATIVE,"If you want to sleep, and noise bothers you, you might want to find another place. The walls and ceiling are paper-thin and you can hear every noise your neighbors (to the sides or above) make. It also happened to be a football weekend and the place seemed to be party central. The party above went on till 4 am, and then began again at 6:30 am. Not sureÂ how they did it, but I got very little sleep. Left the hotel more tired than when I arrived. I will not return."
POSITIVE,"We flew in from Aust to LAX, caught a shuttle bus from the airport. Arrived early (about 10:00am), reception were friendly and had an upstairs room available right away. The lifts were slow but it beats dragging cases upstairs. The rooms need an update but for the price and location it suited me. We had an ajoining room, one of the previous reviewers had the same issue when the people next door decided to disagree we could hear every word like they were in the same room (although it was in Spanish) Once outside the motel it is about 50yards to the pedestrian crossing to the bus entry that leads to Downtown Drive, a short walk to the ticket office an park entries. If you are looking a place to rest your head after spending a day at DL, then consider this place."
POSITIVE,"What I liked: -Very close to almost everything -Great continental breakfast (wide variety) -Very spacious room and nice size bathroom -Extremely clean (I even heard the cleaning lady use a vacuum cleaner... Does that even exist anymore?!?) -Pool was pretty big for a downtown hotel -Nice blackout curtains (good for small children who go to bed early!) -Great toiletries (Aqua Mer spa products: conditioning shampoo, body lotion, bath soap and facial soap) -Free parking and lots available -Laundry room for guests on second floor so very close and convenient ($1.50 per wash and per dry, if I remember correctly) -Nice size television What needs improvement: -Television volume could not go very low, so it is hard to watch when others are sleeping in the room -Toilet flush was VERY weak (had to hold the handle for about 30 seconds for a complete flush!) -Air conditioner leaked from ceiling -Called reception to ask for both things to be looked at and it wasn't done when we got back that evening (air conditioner might be more complex to fix but the toilet flush was NO excuse, really!) -Have to use an underground tunnel to go from one part of the hotel to the other because it is on both sides of a street (our room was on one side and the pool and breakfast room was at the other) so a bit of a hassle at times... -No refrigerator in room or microwave -Pool had some deposits at bottom (sand or minerals, not sure)"
POSITIVE,Perfect for a night or two before a Cruise...Fishing close by at the pier two...Don't forget the parking discount for your Cruise.....Sorry we did when we got off the ship.....Hotel was awesome though....
POSITIVE,"Staff was super nice and helpful, location was very handy. It was easy to get to anywhere we wanted to go. The free shuttle service to the mall was especially nice. Pros: Front desk staff were so nice, and use of computers and printers was great. Cons: Some stains on the carpet in room. Location: Very close to the freeways and easy to get to almost anywhere."
NEUTRAL,"The halls and main building is dated and need to be remodled. Room was clean but again needs updating, but that is what you get for a 2 to 3 star hotel. I think the price should have been cheeper due to the look and feel of the hotel but it is on the beach so they think they can get away with it and they do. Bring your own pillows!!! I don't smoke and the signs say no smoking but the employees do and so does everyone else."
POSITIVE,"Our stay was great! Like the other reviews said, service was great and hotel was very clean. Nice indoor pool. Very friendly staff."
NEUTRAL,"Clean, quite accommodations! Hd dealer next door along with applebees."
POSITIVE,"free breakfast entrance/access near airport great staff, great service, clean place with two separate restaurants and daily room service"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here with two children under 12 for 8 days at the end of August. The view of the marina and boats was terrific as we were on the 5th floor. We were happy with the room---it was a good size and comfortable for the four of us for 8 days. The beds were comfy and wireless internet was included which was great so that we could look up directions to all the places we visited. There is a microwave and small fridge that both came in handy many times. The breakfast was handy and a good deal as it saved us a lot of money on eating out. We often took apples or bananas with us to eat later in the day. The kids really enjoyed the pool out front and we used it every day along with the hot tub. One of the terrific things about this hotel is that parking is free---we checked out many hotels and quite a few charged for parking. You will definitely need a rental car if you want to get around to all of the terrific attractions in San Diego. We were extremely pleased with how convenient this hotel was to getting anywhere we wanted to go. The hotel is located close to a few restaurants that are right across the street and is very close to Rosecrans street which has restaurants, gas stations, liquor stores, grocery stores, banks, and is a main thoroughfare to all of the freeways. It takes about 8 minutes to drive downtown and is quite close to the airport too. All of the staff that we encountered at the hotel were friendly and helpful and we always felt welcome. We also met several other guests stayiing there who were friendly and seemed to also be quite happy with the hotel. We would recommend this hotel in a minute and have both said that we would come back if we were visiting San Diego again! It was convenient, had a great view, had a free, convienent breakfast, free parking and had everything that we needed. Room Tip: Get the harbour view and try to get a higher floor so you can take advantage of the terrific view. See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,Upon check in the front desk clerk was friendly. Quick check in. Room was clean. The beds were super comfy. Wifi worked was alittle slow at first. As we were checking out we noticed the breakfast which we were not told about! Well my kids were able to eat and we didnt spend a fortune in the process. The best part I didnt have to cook the breakfast. Was a good stay and we will stay again if need be. No complaints here!
POSITIVE,"I honestly have to say this Hotel regardless of it being maybe 38yrs. old, offers a pretty overall ambience and a very good hospitality expectation. The staff is well trained and go out of their way to accomadate you and response almost immidietly to any concern you may have, during your stay. We were there for 4 nights and would definetly want to come back as soon as time would allow it. It is centrally located, within a mile of downtown Disney anywhere else toy may want to go. Not to mention the shuttles that take you to the attractions constanly. I had the pleasure in talking with Mr.Bagley the FOM and he mentioned how they are constanly trying tio bring all updates to the Hotel and that very soon all the guest would be able to notice some of them. Don't know exactly the criteria to rate a 5 star Hotel, perhaps the amount amenities. But I sure you this Best Western would definetly rate on a scale of 1-10 a 9+THANK YOU!"
POSITIVE,We were very much impressed with the quality of this hotel. Everyone was super nice and very helpful with the local info. We will definitely stay on our next trip down!!
NEUTRAL,"great location. can walk to shops and restaurants, or take free shuttle to Downtown Disney. room was ok but a little dated, no fridge or microwave, but free wifi. the free breakfast included with our price was really lame. and guest services never told us that you could take Mears Shuttle to Universal Orlando for half the price of a taxi. we found this out on our own, and Mears is great."
POSITIVE,"Hotel is clean, and the service was good. If the Hotel can provide vegan breakfast, that would be more enjoyable for me since I am a vegan."
POSITIVE,"Love the owner he is into it being safe, love the rooms and they are very clean, no pool but beautiful, breakfast was fine, loved the workout room.Pros: They had quality in mind! Secure! Cons: Breakfast"
NEUTRAL,"We haven't stayed at many Best Western hotels in our travels the last few years because the properties have been kind of hit and miss. As we were choosing our room for the night this property's sign stating ""Pets Stay Free"" and the fact that it was a Best Western ""Plus"" led us to try it for the night. It was about $18 less than the room at our preferred chain next door. No problem on check-in with one large dog and a smaller one (admittedly both better behaved than most humans). The clerk was friendly and gave us a ""quiet"" top-floor room away from any road noise as requested. The room was spacious and seemed clean. The king bed was reasonably new and comfortable enough, there was a functional little ""wet bar"" with small microwave and fridge and a decent size desk. Our only minor complaint was the bathroom was small with no counter space to put your toiletries, and the shower head was kind of funky. There was really no great area to take your dogs to relieve themselves except a small strip of mulch & dirt between the property and some commercial buildings next door, but it was adequate for the job. For a hotel that advertises itself as pet-friendly it might be a nice touch to designate an area and put some poop bags there. The other thing that struck us as odd was they still had incandescent bulbs everywhere, and high wattage ones at that. 400 watts above the sink in the little bathroom as not only bright as heck but hot! And despite the upgrades to the decor and furniture they still had a big tube TV in the room. But back to the positive... Breakfast was typical and went from 6-10am and they didn't have Fox News on in the breakfast area. Check-out was again friendly and quick. We would stay here again. Good to see Best Western upgrading their properties and competing with the other chains."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night on our way to Florida. We used the Room Saver online rate and it only saved us $5 from the advertised rate on the hotel marque. The room was clean and had a terrific shower that was so refreshing after a 12 hour drive from Illinois. I would recommend staying here because the room was very clean and you could watch your car from the room. The desk clerks were very knowledgable, friendly and expeditious. We left early and did not partake in the continental breakfast in the morning so I can not rate it but it was offered.This hotel is close to I75 so you can get off and on very easily. It was a Great value for the money"
POSITIVE,"nice clean place was given an upgrade to suite , very happy to be made to feel special Pros: Free breakfast"
POSITIVE,"There is nothing outstanding about this hotel but it does meet the expected level of the Best Western chain. The rooms are clean, beds comfortable and is quiet. Rooms have microwaves, mini fridges and free wifi. The hotel also has a restaurant, lounge and beer and wine store. Visted the restaurant/lounge and was lucky to have a great server. The food was good but the restaurant closes early - 9 pm. There is really no other restaurant/pub options within walking distance. The hotel is right beside a Tim Horton's which is always a good thing."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed one night - didn't realize they allowed pets and didn't fumigate after. When I woke up I was crawling with fleas - pretty gross. Also the toilet ran all night, the heater, when it kicked on, made a horrible racket, and the light by the bed was burned out. I handed the comment card to the man behind the counter - he pointed at a box. I said, you really need to know you have fleas in that room. He glared at me over the top of his glasses - stared me down. No apology, no free night - just plain rude. I'm pretty calm and polite - a grandmother, widow - I guess they think they can just overlook me. Made me pretty mad. Will NEVER stay there again. Wrote BW headquarters about this and never heard anything. Seems like this chain no longer cares - too bad, as a kid we did a lot of motel travel across country and felt Best Westerns were very nice. Not this time."
POSITIVE,"We are usually B&B people, but a last minute trip to Springdale had all of the local B&B's full :( We chose the Best Western as it had fairly good reviews on Trip advisor, and frankly it was our last resort at the 11th hour! When I was booking the hotel over the phone, the person told me that there was only 1 room left and it was a King ""Smoking"" room. Yuck. So I said asked if that was ALL that was left??? Well yes, unless you want the suite...Why wouldn't I want the suite?? why wouldn't they think to mention it prior to that, it was the same price as most of the B&B's. Note to sales people, don't assume anything about anyone.... The room was kept super clean for our 5 night stay and the kitchenette was really handy for us as we were hiking all week and needed a fridge and sink for our lunches. If I had to register one complaint, the internet was really slow....other wise, it was quiet and clean and a great value. Room Tip: Angels landing is the only Suite in the Hotel, it backs away from the road, however, the bathroom is a little worse for wear. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,A good hotel to stay at when visiting Bryce Canyon National Park. The neighborhood has a restaurant and a shop. The hotel itself has a free spa and a free swimming pool across the road. WiFi in the rooms works OK. There is a great breakfast buffet in the morning.
POSITIVE,"Just a little gripe: there are two Best Westerns in Sedona, one as you come into town from the north and this one, further south down the road. It was just a little confusing, at night in the dark, etc. We pulled over to call to confirm which one we were booked in.Once we checked in, we had to lug our luggage down three flights of stairs to level 1 and then UP three flights of stairs at check out. If there was an elevator or another way to do this it was not apparent or shared by the front desk!The heater unit was pretty noisy, too. Cons: Lugging our suitcases down 3 flights of stairs to get to level 1 and then UP 3 flights of stairs the next day to check out. Location: Outstanding views of the scenery!!"
NEGATIVE,"We prepaid for a, 2nd floor king room with balcony. Only 24 hours before we arrived, they called to say they had to move us because a wedding party wanted to be together. We we offered a 2nd floor queen room with balcony overlooking the pool OR a 2nd floor king room without a balcony overlooking the water! Frustrated they waited till 24 hours before we arrived & we'd never been there before, we took the king room overlooking the water with no balcony. They put us almost above the hotel lobby, the furthest room from the water! A long and heavily lite parking lot came between us & the water. We had to keep the wood shutter blinds closed at night because of the piercing lights from the parking lot kept us awake. Very disappointed in room placement & forcing move (request) day before arrival. Also, the desk chair in the room had two broken back hinges. Could get fingers pinched!"
NEGATIVE,"We stayed here previously and it was fine. But this time, big problems with Room 123: 1) the first night we were there, we noticed that top sheet on one of the beds had a ""suspicious"" stain that looked like something from previous guests' love-making. We called the front desk and housekeeping was gone for the night. The front desk clerk brought some new sheets. When I asked if we had to change them ourselves, she said she was just a front desk clerk but she offered to help us. The new sheets had similar stains that she said were just part of the laundry process. We had no choice but to believe her. She did offer us an extra blanket for the bed since it was very cold that night. 2) The heater unit sounded like a jet engine when it started up, so we couldn't use it at night. The second night, we asked for an extra blanket for the other bed, but they said they had run out of extra blankets. 3) The in-room frig made a very annoying rattling sound so we had to turn it off at night. 4) There were saws and other loud noises in the morning every morning we were there, from repair work upstairs. When we complained saying we were hoping to sleep in a little, the front desk just said they did hold off until 9 am before starting the work, as if that would make us feel better about it. Also, breakfast service was a zoo every morning at 9:30. Food supplies were low or they ran out of things and staff seemed to not be able to anticipate the number of guests eating late. Cons: Stained sheets, noisy room, mediocre breakfasts, hotel staff not customer-oriented Location: Nice location in Tucson foothills area"
NEUTRAL,"stayed here when all flights out of SFO were cancelled. Very nice staff, especially front desk. Rooms were surprisingly comfortable, but hotel very tired looking, needs new carpet everywhere. Beds comfy, towels great. Don't be lured by their hot tub spa, there are no chairs around it, uninviting and green with algee. This could be fixed and it would be better. Internet works well. Room Tip: get one up on 3rd floor at least to avoid traffic noise, and ask to face away from freeway. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"This best western was actually quite comfortable and the people working were very friendly. Free breakfast was important to me and they had home made waffles, fruit bars, cereal. Very basic of course no eggs or bacon. Dining area was extremely small but room was spacious and everything was clean and well kept. Just cross the street and youre at the [?] beach! I loved it!"
POSITIVE,"Very Nice pool, hot tub and sauna. Clean and quite rooms. A bit far from downtown area though. you definitely need to have a car to get to downtown area. Highly recommended location to stay in Ottawa."
POSITIVE,"We choose this hotel based on price/location. Now with that the hotel is smaller and not as glamorous as other Chicago hotels but better then other Best Westerns I have been too. The rooms are small which is perfectly fine if all you are doing is sleeping and relaxing in between all the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. The bed was comfortable and I felt like most of the room was updated nicely. The location is the best you are right across from Grant Park, down the street from the Aquarium, and the Art Museum. For people that do not want to walk down to where all the shopping is on the Magnificent Mile then this is not your hotel. It was a decent walk but it was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Parking is valet but we did not use our car once we were in Chicago we simply walked or took pubic transit."
POSITIVE,"We stayed there for 2 days before to return to our country, the hotel is super clean and very confortable beds, a 42'' TV Plasma in rooms, very quite and great hospitality. the chef cooks excellent!! The rooms are new and everything works perfect. The location is not the best but is near of many stores, airport and many places to visit. We enjoyed a lot!!! Room Tip: Clean, new, confortable and good value!!!! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Location was ok, but nothing special. The shuttle service was fine and the beds were great"
NEGATIVE,"We had called the BW 800# for reservations a few hours prior to our arrival and were explicited that we were traveling with a small dog - that went smoothly. But upon arrival everything went downhil, the woman at check in couldn't find our reservation, then found it and claimed they had no more rooms. She kept leaving to do other things and attend to other customers and not telling me why she was leaving what I should do or when she'd be back. Finally the manager came up, he found our reservations but the woman said to him ""we can't put them in a good room, because of the dog"" and he agreeded. To accomodate our dog they upgraded someone else to had yet to be checked in and put us in the bottom of the barrle room. If a hotel needs to put me in a crappy room...don't tell me that.....The whole check in porcess took about an hour!, it was 11pm and it was not like they were super busy at that hour!! And our room was crappy, really crappy. Hard beds, dirty, creepy bathroom. I did complain and they offered usa 35% discount on a future stay.....really.....35% how big of them. I will say the complimentary breakfast ws good and the staff were nice in the breakfast room."
POSITIVE,"Spent a night in stowe to visit ben & Jerry and buy some local food product. Really enjoyed Best Western there. Prices are reasonnable, my room was quite big and clean. Plus there is free wifi and breakfast. Some places look cheaper but they charge you for Internet, breakfast....People were very useful too helping me going to right places for shopping. They have a restaurant, food is just ok, I think there are better places in Stowe but that was just convenient for me not going out again. Good place, I would recommend, worth the price."
POSITIVE,"Excellent Beds, Clean Rooms, Nice Extra's, Tons of Free Parking, Big Truck Friendly, Awesome Greek Restaurant Next Door, OK Pool. I would stay again, 8 dollar cab ride to WEM, way better than most of the surrounding hotels."
NEUTRAL,Great rates for our 3 day stay. Very courteous service. Hotel could use some updating.
POSITIVE,"The location and internet access Sheets need to me more clean and new, towels too You can walk to all tourist sights from here, and there are three metro stations near the hotel: Foggy Bottom, Dupont, and Farragut. The hotel is at the BEST location, you can get everywhere from here by walking. There is Wallgreens and Starbucks and a couple of restaurants in the blocks just around the hotel. The staff is kind and helpful, the breakfast is good, especially for the price. The internet works well and this was very important for me, the staff takes care of your room when you need them to.The small kitchen has a fridge, coffee maker and a microvawe. The only thing is that the rooms could be a bit more clean. I found one towel with mascara traces, but I had tons of towels in the room and this was not an issue. The sheets could really be cleaner, and had oldish look, but I had my own pillow case and I was fine. If you get paranoid I would recommend using your own sheets or loundry room. Perhaps I had the sense that the room could be more clean because I got the room 208, in which I think smoking was previously allowed, at least to me it seemed that way. Also, in this room, if you get close to the windows it gets really cold - I would say something is wrong there. But maybe other rooms are better. I would recommend staying in this hotel, great location and amenities, decent stay, and if you have trouble with cleaningness I'm sure the staff will help with that."
POSITIVE,"Clean, quiet, comfortable but one complaint. As soon as we stepped out of our non-smoking room, the stench of cigarette smoke was overwhelming and offensive. Cigarette smell!"
POSITIVE,"This is the best place to stay in Mt. Shasta. If you value a view, as I do, my advice is to pay a bit more and reserve a mountain-view room. Mt. Shasta, covered by snow, is soothing to see out your window. At times, it may be surrounded by clouds, but when the weather clears, you won't be disappointed. The three-story building in rear of the property has an elevator, and a rear entrance which is very convenient. The rooms seem quite spacious, with vaulted ceilings, while the lodge-like feel is carried out with a wood paneled wall and ceiling. The microwave and refrigerator in room are very convenient. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and certainly beyond the typical motel breakfast, including juices, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, bagels, muffins, biscuits and gravy. The served coffee at your table is quite nice, and the wait staff are friendly and cheerful. The front desk staff were helpful, and did their best to meet guests needs (when the guest printer was out of order, they attempted to print airline boarding passes from their office printer.) The room was clean and quiet. There is an ironing board and a hair dryer in the room. I can't think of what more one could ask of a property. We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. Room Tip: The third floor rooms have the best view of Mt. Shasta"
POSITIVE,"Staff, well maintained, clean Availability of outlets, dated tv Close to Henry Ford Museum, Greenfield Village. 15 min to casino and city attractions. We stay there often when visiting Detroit. The rooms are reasonably priced and very clean. Now the hotel is very dated and takes you back to Best Western Hotels at their prime. The place is extremely well maintained and staff is extremely courteous. The only warning is that it has not beed updated. So bring your VCR tapes for in room movies on the 32 inch tube tv. Also outlets are hard to find for charging all of your gadgets. It has a nice pool and good restaurant attached though. All in all an interesting stay and we continue to go back."
POSITIVE,"Excellent location if you are looking for a easy access to the freeways and don't plan on spending a lot of time in your room. The grounds are really nice, I wish there was more outdoor seating for just hanging out in the nice weather. Rooms were clean and well kept albeit motel quality towels and linens. I would stay here again if in town for another conference. I found the free WiFi to work fine. If you are staying for under $100, it's not a poor deal. Liked: Rooms, Location"
NEGATIVE,"I have already written to Best Western customer services and am awaiting a reply. In short we found a couple of beetles in our bed at breakfast time. We took them downstairs and were told that the manager would be immediately informed and would be in touch with us. After breakfast we found two more which I kept and photographed. We went to check out and speak to the manager and were told that she was at a meeting and wouldn't be available until 12 noon. She arrived at reception after 20 minutes stating she was on a very important international call. She also had no idea of our problem - she had not been informed. The receptionist had put them into a trashcan and were covered by other waste. The manageress took one beetle, crushed it and said it was a bedbug. She then told me she had to have the room ""checked out"", implying we were lying. We travel extensively and were on a month long trip the USand have never seen bed bugs, far less knowing what to do about/with them. The manger and her staff treated us with scant regard and to be lied to and stonewalled in this manner was quite shocking. At the same time another family were experiencing similar treatment at reception."
NEUTRAL,"I am a member of Harley Davidson Ride Rewards program and get points for staying at Best Western hotels so I try to stay at these when I travel. We arrived fairly late after a long drive on a trip to Nashville, Tn. I was tired and had not reserved a room. I saw this one and gave it a try. The front desk clerk was very helpful and got us in fast. The whole lay out of the place is a bit confusing to navigate but found the room with out much trouble. The room was clean but the whole place could use an upgrade. I would probably try to stay at another one though. Oh yes, the air conditioner was very noisy and woke me up several times when it would cycle on. Not an awful place but you could do better. It will do in a pinch."
POSITIVE,"We had a great overnight: the room was quiet, clean, and very comfortable. The desk clerk was friendly and made us feel welcome. The hotel was easy to get to, right off Route 4."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for 2 nights while in the area visiting San Simeon and we loved it. The fire pits on the beach are great on a cool night and the fireplace in the room is even better. And this hotel is the closest hotel to the Hearst Castle. They have a nice little cafe that we enjoyed for breakfast, too. In the room there is a very nice Kuerig coffee maker, too. All in all a wonderful little place to stay. We would stay here again if ever in the area."
NEGATIVE,"We stayed here last year and it was great - room nice, excellent value, efficient and friendly staff. This year, we wanted to stay again on our annual trek south. Because our stay would coincicide with New Year, we booked in advance. On the phone with the hotel we specified an ocean view with tow beds. We were told that's what we would get. We arrived too early for check in, so waited around until 4 pm. We had been told the room number and could see the housekeepers had finished, so finally went to the reception and were allowed to check in. The room was smelly (cigarettes and dirty fireplace), dark and had only one bed. Back to the desk we went. The manager told us there was no such thing as an ocean view with two beds. Another staff member told us we should just try to put up with it. Last year, we paid $99 for the room - this trip, at a staggering $279, we were not prepared to put up with it. After some back and forth, the manager finally offered us a room that he had said didn't exist - ocean view with two beds. The only good part of this experience was that we were able to cancel our reservation for a second night without penalty (we hope - haven't got the credit card bill yet). We had had our stay spoiled and didn't want to prolong it. We won't be back. We are Best Western Rewards members and had hoped to use our member card for our travels. This was the third bad experience at a Best Western in 5 days. We are beginning see where the nickname ""Worst Western"" came from."
POSITIVE,"The rooms were clean and the bed was nice and comfy. The view of the ocean was great and they give you a pair of binoculars in the room. Loved the fire pits and night. The restaurant wasn't five star dining by any means, but it was fine. A very nice place to stay if you are going to see the Hearst Castle."
POSITIVE,"We travel through Charleston every Thangsgiving and have stayed at several hotels in the area. This was our first time at the Best Western and we were very pleased. The room was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. It had a refrigerator and microwave. We didn't go out for dinner, but there are several restaurants in the area. We liked the downtown location, much better than the west side of town which is very industrial. We will definitely stay there again. It is a good value. FYI, Best Westerns do allow pets."
NEGATIVE,"We arrived at the Best Western Hibiscus and went to the front desk to check in. We were dealt with by a female member of their staff. She was not at all friendly and bordering on rude. We did not feel welcome at all. We thought that perhaps she was having an 'off' day, however, upon check out the same lady was the same! We were disappointed that we were not told at the time of check in that the pool was undergoing a remodel and therefore out of use. We found out after we had left, that the hotel had made arrangements for guests to use another hotel's pool. However, the check in lady never told us this!! The room was large, clean and very comfortable. However, we could not get away from the fact that there was no pool to use (and we did not know of another option) and that we had such an unfriendly welcome. I am sure that when the pool is back in service and with some customer service training to the individual we met, then this will be a great hotel. We were very disappointed."
POSITIVE,"We liked our stay at the Hibiscus. It is within walking distance of major downtown area but quieter. It is very close to the water near the Southern Most Spot in the USA marker. One street over from Duval and with assorted places to eat within a couple of blocks. Appears to be an older motel that has been refurbished. Rooms are pleasantly decorated. Pool area is nice. Staff is cordial. Buffet breakfast is more than adequate. My husband liked the breakfast sandwiches from Bob Evans. We would stay there again because we liked the area and were satisfied with the property. Room Tip: 2 levels. Probably better on upper level. We were on poolside. While the motel was filled, we were..."
POSITIVE,"New hotel with rooms and furnishings similar to what you would find in a Marriott. Indoor pool and hot tub were very comfy on a very cold night. Breakfast was OK; a couple of hot items plus Belgian waffles in addition to the continental fare. I stay in a bunch of Hilton/Marriott brand hotels for business. This hotel is comparable to all but the very best of those chains for quality, but far exceeds their value."
POSITIVE,"My wife participates in 3 Day, 60 mile walk to fight breast cancer. This is very nice motel at the mid price range and the 3rd night free was a definite plus. We already made our reservation for next year."
NEUTRAL,"First off, this is listed as a Bakersfield hotel, and the address is Bakersfield on their invoice, but it was actually right off I-5 near Buttonwillow. I picked this hotel because it accepted pets. The room was immaculately clean, the room furnishings were okay (nothing exciting-pretty standard), but the noise from the freeway was really bad. We were upstairs in room 226 and it sounded like were sleeping on the side of the road. My child had a hard time going to sleep because he said there were ""dinosaurs roaring outside."" The hotel provides free continental breakfast in the lobby, but we opted to eat at a nearby Ihop instead, which was good. Please note: we had gotten the last room available. The front desk person told me that they sell out most weekends because of people traveling. Room Tip: Ask for a room farthest away from the freeway."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for three nights for work. Was pleasantly surprised with the quality and appearance of the property and rooms. I received a king size room with corner jetted tub on check-in, which was a nice surprise. Room, bed and bathroom were all clean and comfortable. Great rest, quiet and nice view. The on-site Sawmill restaurant did not meet the high standards of the rest of the property. I had a steak dinner one night, which was overpriced, not prepared to order (charred is NOT medium-well), and took too long to arrive. I also braved the buffet breakfast one morning, but was disappointed in the offerings for the price charged. Both the evening and breakfast staff seemed lost and ill-equipped to serve the customers. Was difficult to effectively communicate with them. Thankfully, there are other good options to eat in Cold Lake. Still worth staying at this Best Western. Room Tip: Stay in the main building, third or fourth floor"
POSITIVE,Convenient location to the interstate and clean and comfortable accommodations for the cost. Great place to stop over for the night. Would stay there again.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here since it is located near my son's home. Very attractive Best Western--definitely a hotel not a motel. Love the lobby--offers 2 computers for guest use. Pool area is large and attractive and has lots of seating. Bedding is very comfortable and room is a nice size . Very pleasant and friendly front desk employees. Only negative is that eating area is not large enough if the hotel has high occupancy, Good value!"
NEUTRAL,"I was surprised to find a room so close to campus for a football weekend, so convenience trumped price (which was twice the rate of any other weekend). All in all, the staff was friendly, the gym and indoor pool were nice, the free breakfast had more options than anticipated, the wireless internet worked and the bed was comfortable. The hotel could use a renovation, but everything worked."
POSITIVE,"very nice staff,hotel has car service that takes you to you to metro lines."
POSITIVE,"The location is the best. You can walk to Villa D'Carlo, the China Inn restaurants, downtown (Jockey Factory Outlet, toy story, gourmet hotdogs, etc.) and then enjoy the glorious view of the harbor and walk out to the lighthouse. A short jog and you're at Eichelman Park and 3rd Ave. Close also to businesses, Post Office. Front Desk was friendly. Guest Internet PC right at the front desk, discourages anyone from spending a whole lot of time on it, as everyone can read your screen. I guess that's the point. So, quick checks of email and flight status was all we could do. Which was fine. Hotel was clean and pool was OK."
POSITIVE,"We recently stayed at the Best Western In at Coushatta because of the lack of avalability at the Coushatta Hotel/Inn. It was a great choice!! The non-smoking room was freshly cleaned, large and comfortable and it had been recently recarpeted. Breakfast offered a good variety and was served in a very inviting hotel lobby. The entire staff was most hospitable....we'll be back!!!"
POSITIVE,"Just returned from our stay there from Aug. 14 - 17. I couldn't agree with the last couple of reviews more. The staff was great, always friendly and attentive to your needs. The breakfast was suprisingly good, with a nice selection of food. Rooms and the whole property were kept very clean and comfortable. Pool area is a little small, expect to get wet sitting by the pool and get cramped with more than 6 people in the pool itself. The free arcade was fantastic for keeping the kids entertained for the rare moments of downtime, games are a little old but still enjoyable. Some could also benefit from a little bit of maintenance. Overall, a very nice property that I would definately recommend to anyone."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at a best western in San Francisco and was very disatisfied, so I was hoping to not expect the same results. I was blown away by the staff, the size of the room (which included a fire place), and the location. Will definitely stay there the next time I'm in Sonoma."
POSITIVE,my room was very comfortable and walking distance tro downtown shops and restaurants the guy robert at the front desk was very helpful and welcoming
POSITIVE,"The hotel was surprising nice and we had a large extended family there with kids. The pool was real nice and the room was very big. The beds were comfy and clean which is very important to me, but the shower was a waste of time. The hotel is obviously renovated, but the plumbing is not. The water pressure and temperature is shared with pretty much everyone, so it was impossible to have a decent shower during peak times. It was either scolding hot or freezing, and then it spit out at us slower than a drizzle. The bathroom was also not perfectly clean. It was acceptable, but I hate hairs everywhere. It shows me they don't clean thoroughly. The carpets were old and gross; we just don't go barefoot, but I find that most older hotels are like this. The only real problem though was that it was too far from all the fun on Duval and Whitehead. We ended up having to rent scooters or take our cars and pay premium for parking when I was hoping we could just walk everywhere. This is not true. Get a hotel on Duval or make sure it is on the west side of the island or you'll regret it later. But if you aren't looking for all the action, this hotel was just fine for families. Quiet and away from it all. Breakfast was ok, but they just didn't have enough selection and closed very promptly at 10."
NEGATIVE,"The amenities do not warrant the price paid. Currently, there seems to be a staffing shortage; our maid was complaining that she was responsible for the rooms on 3 floors of the hotel so a 3:30 - 4 pm room cleaning was not unusual. The attached restaurant was closed for repairs/renovations. Especially on weekends, ""outsiders"" seem to be able to wander in to partake of the free continental breakfast and leave, trick or treat style with bags & containers of goodies (bagels & cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs, orange juice, etc.). All hotels have their ups and downs from time to time but it seems that once the pool is closed for the season at this hotel, it's no longer the right time to make a reservation there. I've stayed here in summer and conditions were much better but staff do try their best for guests even in adverse circumstances."
POSITIVE,"We only needed 1 night to get a good nights sleep while home repairs were being done, and found that this location was pet friendly. It proved to be a great pick, room was clean, bath excellant and bed comfy. As an added plus we walked to Cracker Barrel, which is right in front of hotel and had our evening meal. While we did not use pool or internet we did enjoy the morning breakfast before meeting contractors back home. The breakfast was nothing fancy, but hit the spot. I would not hesitate recommending this to location to any one."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here on two separate occasions. Both times we have had a king suite room with a pull-out sofa. The first time was during a two-night shopping trip and, most recently, enroute home from a vacation. The rooms were a reasonable size, the beds were very comfortable and the microwave and refrigerator worked well. My adult daughter noted that the pull-out sofa was very comfortable. A good mattress made for a good night's sleep. The room lighting seems dark due to the fact that the only window looks out onto the enclosed corridor. It looks as if the rooms were once reached by an external corridor and now that corridor has been enclosed to create inside walk-ways. The shower stall (there was no tub) was akward to use. It is hard to explain the configuration. Again, this was probably a renovation project. The shower reminded us of a locker-room shower. THAT makes us wonder where the PLUS comes from in this hotel's status. As we were on our way home from vacation, having had several different hotel's continental breakfasts, we definately felt that the offered breakfast was adequate and tasty. Nothing overly special or surprising but a good variety of food items was available. All in all, we would stay at this hotel again when in the area."
NEUTRAL,"This might be one of the only BW's in America that does NOT provide breakfast. All you get is a $5 per person voucher for the overpriced diner next door, where an order of toast is $3.50, and any simple two-egg breakfast is going to set you back over $10.00. The rooms are fine--standard BW with a couple of extra pillows and a leaky showerhead--but all in all this is pretty high-priced BW for what you get. Over $100 with any discount. And the front desk help, while exceedingly efficient, are not overly friendly--barely civil, as a matter of fact. They gave us the 3rd degree about pets, and we don't own one. Did they imagine dog hair on my shoulder?? Later, we needed two pool towels and had to show ID and sign for them. The hot tub was so hot we couldn't even dangle our feet in it--nor could the other 4 people who tried. BW just started using a 3 tier system, and this place rates as a BW Plus. Not so much. I think it went to their heads. I'm a regular BW customer, but I won't be back."
NEUTRAL,"If you need to be near the San Francisco airport this is probably as good as any in the $110 range. Clean rooms. Requested wake call failed to occur. Limited tv channels, e.g. No PBS."
POSITIVE,"We always stay at the BW Grosvenor at the beginning and end of our bi-annual motorcycling holiday. As usual both stays were of the same high standard. From Joseph, John and Victor on the front desk to Rosa and Linda in the bar/restaurant all the staff work very hard to make your stay as special as possible. We had a few drinks in the bar and enjoyed meals on both nights. The room was extremely comfortable and quiet. The BW Grosvenor deserves its Plus status."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is beautiful, wthin 15 minutes of the airport and mall of america AND had the MOST FRIENDLY staff that I have ever encountered. Their van service runs 24 hours a day and will shuttle you to any local business. We were greated by their staff at the airport via the van service and it only got better from there. Their driver was funny, courtesous and made our trip even more enjoyable. I would HIGHLY recommend staying at this location."
POSITIVE,It was what I expected for the price. The wi-fi was average but the hotel computers were slow but its free so I can't really complain. The rooms were decent and housekeeping was very thorough. I didn't like their channel selection on the tv and the hotel staff was very slow at check in but it was crowded and they mistakenly double booked my room but they fixed it immediately. I would stay again tho.
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I went to San Antonio with some friend to attend the Rock N Roll Marathon and stayed at the Alamo Suites from November10 through the 17th. The accommodations were roomy and comfortable with the convenience of having a small fridge which came in handy for storing bottled water and yogurts. The view out the sliding door was of an industrial lot, which didn't bother us as we were only there to sleep. The only problem we had with the room was with the air conditioner. During a hot evening the air conditioner was turned on and it would blow out air that smelled musty and moldy. It smelled so bad I avoided using it and kept the window open at night instead. The continental breakfast was ok. The breakfast room had a waffle station, hard boiled eggs, cold cereals and sliced bread, bagels and english muffins to toast, yogurts, coffee, tea, juice, apples and oranges. One thing that would have been nice would have been a bowl of fruit salad in addition to the apples and oranges. Overall the hotel was clean, the location convenient, the front desk staff friendly and a great deal for what we paid for the week."
NEUTRAL,The hotel is as expected for the price. Clean enough.
POSITIVE,We use this motel every time we are in San Diego. Very convienient location to things. This stay however the bathroom was a little out of shape and the front clerk on checkout was a bit rude.
POSITIVE,"Great, right price and accommodations and service was wonderful. Definitely stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Excellent location, great price and good service. My wife and I spent 5 nights here and had relaxing time, were able to visit many local attractions at leisure."
POSITIVE,I am coming up on my 9th week staying at this property. The entire staff have made me feel right at home. I could not have asked for better service.
POSITIVE,"This place was great. They worked really hard to help me find my wallet when I lost it (after houeskeeping helped us tear the room apart, a staffer found it in the lobby and called us right away!), the pool was well-maintained and clean, the staff people were universally classy and nice (I especially liked the lady who maintained the continental breakfast) and it was just a good deal all aroudn!"
NEUTRAL,Staff very friendly and accommodating - pool area nice (did not use) hot breakfast provided daily with different main course - nothing spectacular but satisfactory - casino (small) free drinks provided while playing machines - room cleaned well one night buit not as good the second night - different employee - easy driving access to and from hotel.
POSITIVE,"This is just about 3 miles over the river from Louisville. The facility is modern, clean with great staff. All rooms are ground floor with parking at the door. A work desk is in the room as well as a table and chairs. Also fridge, micro, coffee maker and iron. A hot breakfast is provided in the lobby adjacent to a business center. There are an abundant of restaurants within walking distance as well as plenty of shopping"
POSITIVE,clean freindly nice hotel GREAT free breakfast nice room great poeple a must stay in lawton Room Tip: they have rooms that face a court yard very pretty
NEGATIVE,The hotel is very old and there is no air conditioning. There is a bar across the street that is very noisy until 2AM. Also valet service for hotel lost my car for several hours and initially tried to state that I checked in without a vehicle. Horrible stay do not stay here.
POSITIVE,"This was the best hotel in this price range that I have ever found. Very clean room, has a swimming pool, offered free breakfast including hot food. Well worth the price!!!"
NEUTRAL,"Here on a tour of the Civil War Battlefields. The hotel is OK for an overnight stay. Not very nice surroundings - commercial buildings, etc. and a long way from downtown Richmond Two very good restaurants across the car park from the hotel - TGI Fridays and a barbeque restaurant. We chose TGI Fridays. I had sea food and really enjoyed the salmon. If you produce your hotel key both restaurants give you a 10% discount! The hotel room was OK with the usual amenities - microwave, coffee maker etc. Poor views of the car park and commercial premises from the room. A self service breakfast was served in a room behind reception. At least it was provided with the price of the room. Coffee in paper cups and food on paper plates, sitting on bar stools or on the arms of chairs isn't the greatest breakfast experience but it kept us going until lunchtime."
POSITIVE,"We booked two seperate rooms and stayed here twice during our recent trip to Nebraska. The rooms were clean and comforable, just what one would expect from Best Western. I would recommend this hotel"
POSITIVE,"We were actually only at this place for one night, but it was very nice. We shared a two room suite with friends. Lots of activities for the kids to play (basketball, pool, shuffleboard) as well as a pool, playground and water play station. It was extremely nice! Great chance for friends to catch up while the kids played. I liked the ""quiet"" sign in the front hallway (it was after 11 when we got back from dinner). Another nice touch was plenty of towels/washcloths and a paper cover on the remote indicating it had been cleaned (or maybe you were supposed to push the buttons through the paper cover - not sure but a nice touch). Room had coffee maker also, with nice coffee/tea selection. The only negative thing were some of the front desk staff and getting the room that my friends had reserved. My friends generously paid for my half of the room, but encountered some difficulty trying to get the room they had reserved (had to switch once got into the first room and there was only one room, despite having booked the two room suite), and to get a rollaway bed for my kids (which we really did not need, but my friend had extreme difficulty in getting this for us until I told them I really didn't need one anyway - one adult and two kids slept in the queen bed without problems). I think for the rate the friends paid (plenty), the staff should have been more accommodating. Staff gave great directions to the place and were generally very nice. Had discount tickets to Hershey's available, which was great. Took a peek in the workout room which was slightly smaller but very functional in appearance - did not venture onto the machines in there. The pool had a very vigilant and competent lifeguard also. Highly recommend this place for a wonderful time to catch up with friends! Overall great place; nice and clean and the kids had a wonderful time!"
POSITIVE,"Had a long drive and the room was clean and quite large. Bathroom sink was outside the bathroom which we like and wish more hotels would adopt this type of room plan. Lets one person shower while the other can use the sink. Staff was quite nice and courteous, location good. Will return"
POSITIVE,"This was my third stay, and I'll go again. Everything is fine and convenient, decently priced. And thank God someone still has smoking rooms available!"
POSITIVE,"The location is great because it is only minutes from the highway and from any desired shopping or eateries. The staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms were in better condition than I have seen in hotels that are considered to be ""nicer"" than a Best Western, so I was very impressed. It was immaculately clean and provided a very comfortable [?] living space. The free continental breakfast was also very delicious! Which is not quite something that I've come to expect from hotel breakfasts anymore, even for ones that are not free. In all, I was blown away by this hotel. It exceeded any expectations that I had for the stay. I definitely intend to stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Keeping this very simple, this is a very nice place to stay and worth the modest prices."
POSITIVE,"We travel through Saint George several times a year and have stayed at many different motels/hotels there. Based on that experience, we now stay at the Coral Hills exclusively. The rooms are great, the location is good, the staff is very attentive and the price is right. No need to look elsewhere!"
POSITIVE,"This location is where my family and close friends stay when visiting from out of town. It is right off the highway and very easy to find. The included breakfast buffet is always a hit with everyone who comes in, and is an incredible value."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for 6 nights, and used it as a home base to visit the Gulf coast. Went to New Orlenas on 2 seperate days, Biloxie casinos for a few evenings, and Mobile for another day trip. The proximity to the highway was good for us. Plenty to do in the area (cinema on a rainy day). There was a storm in the gulf, so the beaches were not high on our list of things to do - but they are close. This is not a new motel, but it has been recently remodeled, and is well maintained. The folks that work there are very plesant to interact with, from the desk staff to the young ladies that are in charge of the breakfast buffet. The breakfast area was spotless - and the selections of food were good. After a week, we would have liked something diferent, but for a few days it is good. We stayed in a king room, and liked the fact there was a microwave, and a refrigerator. The room also had a small safe as well as an ironing board and iron (the free laundry was a nice touch). The free wi-fi was inconsistant at best - sometimes working very well, and others almost not at all (frustrating)."
POSITIVE,"we came through morro bay in April 2012 on a road trip with our kids (aged 10 and 12 at the time). it was a bit chilly (we aren't really outdoorsy folk) so after walking around the beach for a bit we just wanted to chill out after driving all day. there didn't seem like there was too much to do in morro bay itself (other than going to ooh and aah at the ""rock"" for a while!) The kids loved the pool! we thought it would be too cold (the air temperature was!) but the pool was like a BATH! the motel is really lovely - just what you see when you watch movies! a lot of people had dogs - but you wouldn't know this as we didn't see one dog hair in our room, and no dog smell - they must do a really good job clearing up after them! the rooms are very clean and look refurbished, and it was a bonus that the kids could pick a complimentary dvd to watch in the evening. hotel easy driving distance from shops and the ""rock"" if we ever come on a road trip to california again, i would love to stay here."
POSITIVE,"Nice, clean, easily accessible, plenty of free parking, and a helpful staff.Cons: Continental breakfast - pretty lousy!"
POSITIVE,"Rooms are clean and comfortable, continental breakfast was good with a lot of variety. Would stay again no hesitation. Room Tip: Convenient location, clean and good breakfast."
NEUTRAL,"The main reason we stayed at the Adams Inn was because they had a shuttle to the airport and to the cruise ship pier. WARNING: book your shuttle ride early! Of the 4 times we would have used it, only twice worked out for us. One time the shuttle was already full and we had to call a cab ($40 cost), and the other time there was a 1.5 hour wait for it to come get us (another $40 cab ride). The view out the windows to the river and the park across the river was nice, but the windows don't open. On-site restaurant was very handy and we had a couple of good dinners and breakfasts (free) there. The subway station was a little too far for my 80 year old mother to walk to, so the shuttle ran us over and picked us up again, which was nice. All the employees were very helpful, it's just that the hotel itself is a bit tired and could use an updating."
POSITIVE,This hotel was perfect and the service was incredible.Pros: I enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. We didn't have to leave the hotel. Cons: The pillows weren't very firm. My neck hurt.
NEUTRAL,"It was a good location for the event we were attending, which was the Greycup. Within walking distance to the venue, easy access to tourist sites and restaurants and shopping. A location that made access almost anywhere quite easy. Facilities sufficient but limited."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is possibly two star, it's a motel... No elevators to take my luggage to the room. The tv didn't work, the shuttle driver was rude ... Actually shouting when they came to pick me up .... Breakfast was continental, and for the price iwould say you'd be better off at a travellodge and save some money."
NEUTRAL,"Greenfield is an older property but has been well maintained. Staff is very friendly and rates are reasonable Area recommendations Allen Park , due to closeness of The Henry Ford , etc Must see Henry Ford museum, Greenfield Village, Henry Ford estate, Ford Rouge factory tour, Edsel Ford estate"
POSITIVE,"Since it was my first stay in NYC, it is hard to compare, but the staff was friendly and it was a great location."
POSITIVE,"You can't go wrong with this one. Pam & I stayed at the Best Western in Minocqua on our way to a Labor Day get together farther north in Iron County, WI. The staff was extremely friendly and efficient. We each received a coupon for 2-for-1 drinks at the on-location bar (we didn't use them, but it appeared as though many folks were). There were the usual water bottles in the room, so we looked to see how much they charged ($2, $3, $5?). They were, actually, complimentary! What a nice touch. Such an inexpensive gesture, yet so appreciated. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The beds were comfortable as well. Bathroom was larger than we expected. The breakfast buffet was good, scrambled eggs, sausage, those make-your-own waffles, plenty of fruit and yogurt, juices, etc. On a budget, or for a quick stopover, we recommend this location. Room Tip: There is nice brewpub right accross the street and we went there for dinner. I highly recommend it. The food was outstanding. See more room tips"
NEGATIVE,"Booked through their 800 # as a Platinum member and they told me it was in Kalispell and we were on motorcyles. We like to stop and walk to get something to eat and a couple beers when we finish each day....like most riders. When I mentioned it to the desk clerk when we found them, he said....""well we are technically we are in the Kalispell limits"". However, the internet showed otherwise and when we left that morning headed ""into"" Kalispell.....it was exactly 5.5 miles to the sign that said ""Entering Kalispell"". They wouldn't rescind the reservation we had made minutes earlier and were indignant. He also had the audacity to tell us that there was a ""C"" store next door and we could get some snacks there! If you want to stay ""in"" Kalispell....don't book here or if you don't want to drive to eat or drink (hopefully, not). Very poor customer service in my opinion. Wouldn't stay there again (three of us are riding back up that way in two weeks) even if they were in Kalispell. In fairness to those who want to stay there, it was decently clean and kept. I think the price is a bit spendy, but you may not."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel is clean and in good condition. We got one of the rooms with the pull out sofa. The pull out sofa was not comfortable at all but when I went to the front desk to ask if we could get a roll out, if they had any available, they agreed. They didn't charge me for the roll away. I thought that was very nice. We were also on the room closest to the highway. There was alot of noise from the highway. I would recomend trying to get a room furthest away from the highway. The regular beds were firm but very comfortable. Loved the water pressure in the shower. The breakfast consisted of waffles (you cook with waffle iron) a few pastrie options and a few other options. The indoor pool, while we didn't go swimming, looked like it was clean and well maintained. The internet service was reliable and not slow. Would definately stay here again. There is a Loves truck stop close by that has a Subway and Godfathers Pizza in it. Room Tip: Request a room furthest from the highway which would be on the east for less highway noise."
POSITIVE,"We got this hotel last minute for 1 night while touring the Everglades. First off, Florida City is not the greatest, but it is a great jumping off point for some early morning Everglades excursions. This seemed to be one of the better hotels in the area. Several other hotels have barbed wire fences around them and while this one didn't I'm not sure if I should be glad it didn't or worried? Check-in was kind of strange. The woman at the front desk told us that hotel.com had booked us in a handicapped room and asked if it was OK or if we wanted another room. When I asked if I could have another room, she said no there weren't any. Why did you ask then exactly? Our room was first floor with an outside entrance. Bedding was nice and there was a nice flat screen in the room. We found our stay to be very quiet with no disruptions. There are lots of food options in the area including a Krispy Kreme donut shop nearby for breakfast. One big issue for us was that they did not have wireless internet in the room, only in the pool area. In the room you have to plug in and they provide directions for connecting in that way. Overall a good place in this city. I felt safe and was happy to have a clean place to stay for the night."
POSITIVE,"I read the other reviews, and really like this place. It is a great location, and the remodel has really made it nice. I love the little touches, from the towels folded on the beds to the nice shower head, beautiful granite and raised sink. The bed seems comfy as well. There are only small things I would change. The air blows the curtains up so that it doesn't flow into the room very well. I think a smaller table and chair set would be helpful for a two bed room. It makes it really tight. Also, you can still hear the people next door, doors slamming, and loud tvs. However, I haven't found any hotel/motel that can completely insulate noise. And the noise of the neighbors went away fairly quickly, and like another reviewer said, you can't hear anything of the freeway noise. The young woman at the front desk was great as well. She even asked if we had any discounts."
NEUTRAL,"Late arrival on Friday night was greeted by a very perky Indian clerk at the check-in. Needless to say, it was a warm welcome considering the neighborhood and its restless locals. AVOID ROOMS 120 THRU 132 unless you require wheelchair access. Room 130 opens out to the parking lot on street level and is less than 10 yards from the 7-11 across the street. Because of the convenience store's hours, there is an unnecessary amount of crass, loud and incivility among the young locals who cannot afford gambling at the local casinos by 2am. Breakfast room on the 2nd floor is pretty standard. They have waffle batter and only 1 electric waffle machine; bagels, bread for toasts; 5 cereal selections; a juice dispenser along with coffee and tea. Selection of fruits were abysmal by 9:30am but then again, they stop serving at 10am. Do not use the hotel's WiFi, even if is free of charge (BWEnvoy is the network name). There's another open network called SpeedLink24. The data speed is much faster. Room Tip: Avoid even-numbered rooms 120 thru 132 See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"As soon as we arrived in downtown Nashville we seen cops sworm a huddle house so we decided we would not be staying downtown we would pay a little extra and stay somewhere safe. So we went to opryland. After stopping at a few hotels that were all ""booked""( it was around midnight on a a Saturday) we stopped at this Best Western. All they had was double beds so we took it. I believe the rate was around $70. The room wa very spacious with a couch and coffee table and nice bathroom. The room was very clean. We were able to book a king size bed for the rest of our stay which was just as wondeful! The staff was very friendly and very helpful with attractions dining and transportation! Very good quality for the price I give this place 5 stars!"
POSITIVE,"This was our first trip to Puerto Rico and we were arriving late at night and did not want to drive to another hotel. It was easy to walk down the sidewalk from the baggage claim to the entrance of the hotel. The room and bath were small but clean, and the staff helpful. The breakfast buffet meets the minimum requirements for a light breakfast. But it is fine for one night as you arrive or depart San Juan. Would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel due to closeness to Hammond Stadium where the Twins play. It's 2.8 miles one way, quite a hike in heat but my wife and I walked to and from two games. Great breakfast in the morning - something for everybody. We were there for two nights about a week apart. The only issue we had was during our second two night stay. There was a problem with the air conditioning. It cooled the room fine, but the blower and condenser ran for several minutes then shut off. When it came back on, the fan made several false starts (like a car engine turning over# and the began to run with the condenser starting after the fan. This went on all night, making it hard to get a decent nights sleep. Reported problem to the desk and a manager said maintenance would repair if possible. The hotel was full so our request for another room couldn't be filled. When we returned that evening, there was no note telling us if the problem was fixed or not. It wasn't. Second night was a repeat of the first. When the front desk was informed the next morning of our unhappiness the only response was that it would be checked out again. A maintenance man was there and said he thought he may have looked at it the day before but wasn't sure. No effort to apologize or offer a cash rebate #room had already been paid for throught Expedia). Not very happy with the front desk/management due to the last two nights. Would stay there again, but would insist on better response to a problem"
POSITIVE,"Bed and bedding were very clean and comfortable Outdated bathroom I've stayed at many Hampton Inns, and while the bathroom in this hotel room paled in comparison to all of the other, more modern and contemporary Hampton Inns, my room and stay overall was fine for a two night stay. The bathroom was clearly old and in need of renovation, but it was still clean and didn't bother me during my two night stay"
POSITIVE,"Excellent budget hotel. I normally stay at one of the other chains which also includes breakfast in the room rate but this hotel was more convenient. Hotel was quiet even it is located conveniently near the Greensboro airport. Hotel was spotless. Cons: Breakfast Hotels which include breakfast in the room rate provide a high fat/high carb meal. We ended up just getting the coffee, which was very good."
NEGATIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel several times over the last 10 yrs. It has been 4 yrs since my last stay and the deterioration was very visible. This hotel needs a re-vamp.The room was clean, comfy but out dated. The beds were comfy.There are almost no public spaces and no where to sit in the lobby other than a couple of hard chairs and a wood bench.The food and serving staff was very good for both dinner and breakfast.Will look for a new place next time I visit Kingston with my family."
POSITIVE,"We stumbled on this beautiful hotel and were lucky to get the last room. Americus is a lovely quiet victorian town, with this hotel as it's centrepiece. We were driving south from New York to Florida and this was the perfect spot for a break, we stayed an extra day we were so relaxed. We were travelling with our 5 month old, and had a cot in the room, but it was no problem the rooms were so spacious. Lovely big bathroom with a good shower. The hotel is fantastically atmospheric, it's been so well restored, we just wanted to explore the whole place. The foyer with 3 storey ceiling, open fire and beautiful decor sets the scene perfectly, the hotel reveals more and more features as you explore. The food was brilliant, really friendly staff, and the owner was really interesting and welcoming when we met him. We have only praise, and unreservedly recommend the Windsor for those who enjoy beautiful surroundings, comfort and a bit of history."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel at least a dozen times over the past couple of years for various business trips and have no intention of staying elsewhere. The hotel is centrally located and staff are always very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, nicely appointed and I feel offer excellent value for the area. Parking is plentiful and easy to access which is a nice bonus, as is being able to go for a relaxing swim in the pool."
POSITIVE,Affordable and comfortable hotel close the the Yosemite south entrance. Nice facilities. Clean. Recommend.
NEUTRAL,"Our stay did not begin well - we did not initially have the promised up-grade, and found the first room allocated to be dingy, over-heated and very noisy. The first evening meal involved a 45-minute wait for two badly-overcooked steaks. However, we could not fault the staff for their eagerness to put things right. We were moved to a quieter, ""superior"" room and offered a complimentary bottle of wine. The staff went to great lengths to make sure we were happy. The breakfasts and cream teas were lovely, the dining rooms and sitting rooms were cosy and beautifully decorated for Christmas, in fact the hotel has a lot to recommend it. Room Tip: Try to book a superior room."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Pavillion in york as part of a wedding , the rooms were lovely and as a wedding venue it is beautiful we had a lovely day, comfortable night and breakfast was good. A little expensive but as a treat lovely accommodation."
POSITIVE,"Good hotel for the money, nice location and family safe. Will come again."
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Radford Inn this weekend for a family event. The location is close to campus, so there are lots of restaurants nearby. Our room was clean and the staff was friendly. Even though we chose a non-smoking room, the hallways leading to our room still had that stale smoke smell. Thankfully our room smelled ok. This looks like an older hotel that has recently been updated. Our bathroom was small, but the fixtures looked pretty new. There was an extra sink just outside of our bathroom that looked like it was maybe left over from before the renovation. It looked older and the drain was either rusty or dirty. It was a little odd; not sure why it was there. But like I said, the room was clean, the sheets and towels were clean. The bed wasnât the most comfortable ever and the towels were a little thin and scratchy, but it was all fine for a nightâs stay. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast, so I canât comment on Alejandroâs. The breakfast was pretty standard; a waffle station, baked goods, fruit, cereal, bagels, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy. The eggs and sausage gravy seemed like they came from a box, but I think this is standard for most chains like this. But it would be really nice to have some freshly made items there, especially since they have a full kitchen capable of producing such things. The staff happily accommodated our rather large group while we took over the restaurant at breakfast, and later the front lobby while we hung out and chatted before heading our separate ways. And every employee we ran into greeted us with a smile. If youâre looking at this place from a utilitarian perspective, it has everything you need. (Including free wifi â that was a plus.) If youâre looking at it from a creature comforts perspective, you might be disappointed. But I think most people know what theyâre getting themselves into when staying at a place in this price range. I donât know that Iâd stay here again, but I donât know that Iâll ever have a reason to be in Radford again either."
POSITIVE,"You get what you pay for. Cheap, easy, convenient. Really nice king-bed suites but regular rooms are average. I really liked the rooms with balconies."
POSITIVE,"Found this gem travelling south from Calistoga...very new and so well equipped it's hard to know where to start! The rooms are ultra modern and comfortable..we thought there would be noise from the road but no, we had agreat night's sleep. Breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful. Convenient Mexican restaurant next door so we didn't have to drive again after a long day in the car."
NEUTRAL,"My advice here is donât go to Napa â if you are visiting wine country head up to Calistoga. Having drive round Napa for hours trying to find a hotel that was both affordable and somewhere Iâd actually want to stay itâs really not a place Iâd like to see again. Ended up at this hotel, way out of town so if you want to get into Napa youâll need to drive. Generally Iâll sleep in the car rather than a Best Western but needs must and it had been a long drive, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Good sized room, quiet and clean (although bathroom awful, weak shower and a tub the size of a postage stamp). Plentiful breakfast. They have tried to make it look & feel like a boutique hotel but that doesnât really work on this sort of scale â itâs corporate through and through. So if you have to stay in Napa, & donât mind driving when going out to eat in the evening, then this place will probably do you just fine."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this property multiple times during June, July & August for business. The property is immaculate and all staff members are Friendly, Professional and helpful. The rooms are large and the breakfast is very good quality. 10-15 minute walk to Rahway Train Station gets you to Penn Station NYC in about 40 minutes."
POSITIVE,"Stay at Best Western hotels normally. This is well situated for all the local sites. Hotel does not do breakfast so we bought things at local supermarket. Nice room with all the facilities required. Cleanliness of carpets in the room and corridors wasnt very good. The corridor carpets needed replacint or at least a shampooing. Most of the reception staff were ok but one wasnt helpful when we asked to stay an extra night. So we moved on to another hotel, Lovely area around and we managed to visit some absolutely lovely places. Would certainly recommend the area, Room Tip: We chose a suite. Very well equipped. See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,"We stayed with our two teenagers in a queen suite, with a queen bed room downstairs and three single beds upstairs in the loft. Full kitchen was nice to have, although we ate out. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, room was clean, but could use updating; carpet and some loose threads on chairs. More like a rental ski condo then a hotel. Location is quiet, and an easy walk to all parts of the small town of Jasper."
POSITIVE,"We stayed overnight at the Best Western Inn in Rice Lake, WI and we were greatly pleased. The room was nice and VERY clean. The beds were comfortable, the staff were friendly and the continental breakfast was great. This is definetly one of the nicest and cleanest motels we have stayed at. Also, affordable."
POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed our trip to Oceanside and the Best Western was in a great location. We were a little freaked out when our 10 month old daughter's knees turned black from crawling on the carpet. It got better after we closed the patio door and the air dried out a little bit but it was still dirty, definitely worrisome.They have a decent complimentary breakfast for the price but they're kind of controlling about it. You have to have a voucher to get in and it costs $15 if you lose your voucher (and this breakfast is definitely not worth $15).Our room was really quiet though and the expedia price was very reasonable for being so close to the beach. We would go back to this hotel."
NEUTRAL,"The location is fine with easy access to public transportation to the 'strip' and a hotel van that travels to the airport (but only on the hour). For $2 extra saves can be had in the room. The rooms are very good size with a TV, small refrigerator and coffee/tea maker. Mine did not have a microwave. The pool seemed to be clean but in January no one was using an outside pool. There is a small hot tub that people were using. There is a small but decent restaurant in the hotel with a good breakfast buffet and limited choice but decent suppers. I didn't have occasion to interact too much with the staff but they were cordial and helpful when I did. Ample parking along the hotel's sides. Nearest cheap place to eat is 1/4 mile down the street, a McDonald's. One of the cheaper name brand hotels in Vegas. Room Tip: Rooms away from the pool side are a bit quieter, especially in warmer weather, as the outside hallway runs between the pool area and the room doors."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here at least one night every year for the past 4 years. We enjoy the cookies at 10pm. The accommodating staff (front desk, housekeeping and maintenance always is willing to assist us when needed. While poolside, we regularly have had management come by and check in with us regarding our service and stay. We like the poolside rooms and find they are not too noisy even when the pool is open and we are in our room with the door closed. Their night staff is patient and accommodating as well (especially on special occasions)."
POSITIVE,I'm still waiting for my $50 deposit to be returned to my debit card. The hotel was good for the price and the breakfast was very good. Overall a decent Hotel...assuming I get my deposit back sometime in the very near future.
POSITIVE,My husband pulled out a LARGE amount of hair and lint out of the drain. We hate water at our feet when taking a shower.
POSITIVE,"My wife and I have business in Dallas quite often about 8 times or more a year. We've tried several other Hotels in the Dallas area and have decided that Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel & Conference Center is the best for the money. The rooms are always clean, the front desk staff are always very nice and helpful. The hotel is centrally located to mostÂ places in Dallas, Richardson, and the surrounding area. As for my wife and I Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel & Conference Center is the only place we will stay. They have a very nice complimentary breakfast which is more than just doughnuts and coffee. It's great."
POSITIVE,"The hotel itself is fine (clean, comfortable, etc) but it's several miles from downtown and if there is traffic the drive can take 30 minutes or more. If you're looking to save money and don't need to be close to downtown, this is a fine choice."
NEUTRAL,Good desk service. Complimentary breakfast horrible: the worst i have ever seen in Best Western. The room was ok.
NEUTRAL,The Beds need pillow top because the mattress was so firm!!! Pros: Good location Cons: Beds Location: Good location
NEUTRAL,"Easy to miss the entrance when you're eastbound on Pine Ridge. Look carefully for the entry road. The hotel was clean, but pretty dated - more so in the rooms than the common area. The Wifi was very slow and blocked me several times for lack of capacity. Needed more bandwidth and/or access points. Breakfast was OK. Not much choice except for lots of breads and carbs."
POSITIVE,"A very quiet, very intimate place ... I like it. Is very pleasant.... Friendly staff, Christian thank you for explaining the address to arrive soon..."
POSITIVE,"We went on a boys holiday from the UK to New Orleans for voodoo weekend. The hotel was brilliant, loads of room in a twin, we had a shower/hot tub bath, it was clean but didnt have a window, the location was right in the edge of the french quater, close enough to experience it but far enough away not to keep you up at night. perfect place for friends and coulpes."
POSITIVE,the room was very clean & beds very comfortable and the breakfast was excelent the oonly downside that the indoor pool was closed for remodeling ...but everything else was perfect. Liked: Rooms
NEUTRAL,"It is a motel, partly nicely decorated, persons at the front desk were friendly, washer broken, beach chairs broken, built too close to two gas stations (smell and noise) and interstate, breakfast not satisfactory."
POSITIVE,"We drove from Colorado for a family wedding on Lake McConaughy. The room was clean and the beds were really comfortable. We had a quiet room facing the river and there was never a problem with highway noise. The room was large enough to accommodate our portable crib. If we ever need a room in town again, we will definitely stay at BW."
POSITIVE,"Loved the room! Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to dine in the restaurant nor to use the pool or other facilities as we arrived late in the evening and had a morning commitment, leaving us just enough time to return to the hotel and check out the next day. We would have liked to have stayed another night or two, but regrettably, the hotel was fully booked.Pros: The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom, too! Cons: The street it is located on is very dark after sunset (no street lights) and gives an eerie and seedy feeling."
POSITIVE,The staff were welcoming and helpful. The room was well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room was well laid out and there was plenty of surface to comfortably spread out.Pros: The room was well appointed and the bed was the most comfortable bed we've slept on. Cons: The exterior and location aren't super appealing.
POSITIVE,"Booked here one Saturday night, when I knew I would have a late night in Coeur d'Alene-Spokane, ended up getting back before SNL. Pros: Very pleasant large room, great bathtub, which came in very handy. A good comfortable room with fridge, coffee, and better than usual electric outlets. It was much better lit than many Best Westerns I have stayed at in PNW, very quiet rooms, better pillows and bedding than usual, very comfy (but next section has some additional comments on beds) Cons, mattress was hard, it really could have used a better mattress pad, which was interesting because the blanket was great. Overall seemed bery clean except one thing, there was a dark streak on floor of bathtub, I almost called hotel manager, it turned out to be spilled shampoo, still not perfect, but it was late so I washed it out. The soap and shampoo was in a dispenser, I have seen these before (and at the Davenport no less). I really don't like these, luckily one bar of soap was provided at the sink, but I really wish another one had been Location very out of way, basically ideal for Post Falls, or Spokane Valley, but it is a longish drive into CDL or Spokane, is right on interstate. On the whole a nice Best Western, better than quite a few I have stated at and better than any hotels in its class I have stayed at in CDL-Spokane. Will be returning."
POSITIVE,Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Staff was very friendly. Rooms at back of the hotel were very quiet. I would stay at this hotel again if I returned to New Orleans. Pros: Very nice courtyard within hotel setting. Very quaint! Reasonable parking accommodations. Location: Great location and within walking distance to French Quarter activities.
NEUTRAL,"good location, great food, restaurante staff perfect... the hotel price is too high for what it is... Pros: on the beach, restaurante Cons: size of the room, too small for the price Location: great, if the weather is fine"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel mainly because it was ""pet friendly"" and it definitely was. There is a large grassy area to take our ""boys."" It was our first time taking our dogs to a hotel and I will definitely do it again. The hotel staff were all very accomodating and pleasant; the room was clean, nicely furnished, and had a coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator. There was a small lounge/restaurant/bar which was very convenient. The free breakfast was excellent."
POSITIVE,this hotel is brand new & by far the best Best Western hotel I have ever stayed at. The hotel even smells new. The restaurant was decent & the free breakfast was great too. They upgraded me to a suite as they weren't sold out that night which was a great touch as well. I would definitely stay at this hotel again & I would recommend it to anyone
POSITIVE,Hotel was great. We had great service.
POSITIVE,Our stay was okay; we were on the 2 nd floor. It is a new hotel but it is in a remote location of Calgary; somewhat industrial. We stayed after a perfect day at the Zoo. We were heading north so it worked out for us. After reading the reviews I think I put my exceptions to high. The room was clean and the big TV was awesome. We also had the pool/water-slide to ourselves which was awesome after 6 hours of walking. The breakfast was included. It offered lots of variety; but there were some challenges communicating our order to the omlette person.
NEUTRAL,"Pleasant front desk staff and the best ""continental"" breakfast I've seen with responsive staff there as well. Our room faced the main street/highway with large mall across the road and we didn't encounter any noise issues"
POSITIVE,Thanks to Edwin and his staff for making our stay wonderful. Attentive and friendly staff. The hotel is located in good location near bars and restaurants. The hotel itselt is lovely..rooms are very clean and spacious..and the pool area are is gorgeous. Continental breakfast included in room package. Highly recommend to anyone.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for 4 nights, and loved my choice! Hotel is very nice,clean and in a great spot on the strip! Always a taxi outfront or bus service next door! staff were really good and friendly! Would be my first choice staying in l.a again! Only had one downside, floors are a bit creeky, not enough to keep you up but it is noticeable! Other then that, perfect!"
POSITIVE,"This is, as noted by others, an older property..say, 1950's...but has been very nicely updated. Clean. warm (October cold front came in) and quiet. Suspect the walls are brick, so noise insulation is excellent : ) Good price and excellent breakfast..the older woman preparing food was friendly and helpful..rather like having a dorm mother around. Room Tip: If you are a large person, you may want to be sure to ask for an accessible room...the only down sid..."
NEGATIVE,"Not that you really care but here goes. I asked for a non-smoking room but was placed on the third floor which was a smoking floor. If i dont smoke why would I enjoy smelling smoke in the hall way, or why would I enjoy going into the bath room which smells like some one had been smoking. This is my very last stay at a best western hotel."
POSITIVE,"I met up with some friends in LA for a 3 night long weekend stay. My friend had already booked this hotel, so I went anyway. To be honest I didn't expect much from this hotel and thought it would be a typical Best Western motel with no character. Wow - I was wrong! THIS HOTEL IS FABULOUS! It is not a high rise tower-type hotel - small and cozy with about 5 levels. The rooms were extremely clean and spacious. We had a room for 3 people, and there were two queen/king size beds, plasma TV, desk and little kitchette, closet and LOTS of room. The bathroom was very clean and had a large circular tub with shower. There is a beautiful pool in the center of the hotel with very pretty flowers and day beds. The breakfast is OK - a lady will make waffles on request, there are bagels, pastries, coffee and boiled eggs. The staff are very attentive and friendly, and the location is wonderful. 5 min drive to Hollywood Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Wax Museum, shopping. There are also many iconic bars within easy walking distance from the hotel. Room Tip: We stayed in room 214. It sounded like there might have been offices or employee space above us as there was a lot of ""traffic"". Try to get a room on the top floor."
POSITIVE,"We had a girls trip to LA and 4 of us stayed in one room (2 queens) and it was great. Spacious enough... clean, comfortable beds. Free breakfast was definitely a plus. Location was good as well. Wasn't warm enough for the pool but looked clean. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Front desk was friendly and polite. Rooms are small, even though a ""suite"". Bathrooms are TINY. Room was clean, and maintenance was very fast (stopped-up toilet). Walls are thin, so we could hear water running, vacumming, people talking, etc. making it a little difficult to sleep. Parking is horrible; insufficient number of spaces in the garage, and [?] even with what's there, the spots are too narrow (or too many people park over the line so they can exit their cars?). Didn't get to try the free breakfast. A little expensive for what we got -- but maybe it's the season?? Decent location."
POSITIVE,"I stay at this hotel often. It is a great hotel. This stay the room was borderline satisfactory. The wifi signal was not available in my room. I was able to get internet access with ethernet cable provided by front desk. The toilet ran quietly, but continuously. The shower temp was hot or hotter, the sink faucet was in need of repair. It ran continuously [?] unless over cranked. Front staff was very receptive, but issues were not addressed during my stay."
POSITIVE,"Stay in room was comfortable. Clean Â  slept good! Â  The smokehouse was a very nice store & restaurant, Ate there for breakfast ,twiice and 3 times for supper. Food was excellent. loved their fried pies & fudge. Oh, did I say great coffee! plan to go back. talked to alot of people in the town and visiters and all told me good thinds about the smokehouse. some people should never be allowed to give a review.They will try to ruin a business by untrue statements. AAAt Â serivce"
POSITIVE,"I was pleased with everything about the hotel. The staff was more than accommodating; food in restaurant was good, facility (including room) was clean; shuttle service was way more than would be expected at most hotels. I'd recommend this hotel to everyone and would go back if ever in the area again."
POSITIVE,"Affordable price, clean and comfortable rooms, and within walking distance of the Metro. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"I had such a great time staying at this hotel. The front desk kindly upgraded our room to a suite, and let me tell you, the bathtub was HUGE, with jet-streams that churned up the shampoo I added to make a bubble bath. Speaking of which, the shampoo and conditioner left my hair silky and smooth (and I have thick curly hair), totally unlike my usual hotel toiletry experiences. The landscape is just beautiful, the rooms were quiet and the pillows and beds were SO COMFY! The complimentary breakfast was also delicious--fresh waffles, strawberry syrup and jams of all kinds, fresh fruit, and all kinds of cereal/bagels/pastries to choose from. I really was pleased. Would definitely stay here again."
NEGATIVE,This place is in a great location and right in downtown Sonoma. We have stayed here before and we enjoyed our stay. This time the place is sort of run down and under construction. The charge 300.00 night for a room that is maintained to a level well below that price. This is a older Best Western. I think management should know this and get focused on thier facility.
POSITIVE,"This hotel offers probably the best value for budget accommodation on Sunset. The rooms are of reasonable size and well maintained however the air conditioning unit is noisy. The included breakfast is of reasonable quality for a bagel/coffee/OJ offering. As is usual for this location, parking is valet and expensive."
POSITIVE,"This is the very nice hotel to stay with , room are good size and cleaned, bed is very comfortable, front desk are very friendly,"
POSITIVE,"In Indio for a concert, and needed a hotel close by. Chose BW Date Tree based on TripAdvisor reviews. This hotel was everything we expected. Not fancy, and yes slightly dated, but clean, convenient to our destination, and staff, especially Andrea, was exceptionally helpful. Would definitely stay here again."
NEUTRAL,"we were very satisfied with the hotel and how close it was to the strip, however the girls at the front counter really need to work on their people skills and learn their job. the women in front of us was yelling at them and we thought it was just a rude women, and then we had to deal with them and quickly realised it was the staff. will never stay here ever again, and will not recommend this hotel to anyone. oh and clean your carpets once in awhile."
NEUTRAL,"We had an issue with the TV as we could not make out the picture and there was a lot of static. They were new (not a bad thing) but apparently not hooked up correctly (very bad thing). However, the desk person moved us right over to another roomwhere we could see all the TV stations just fine (a very good thing). We forgot toothbrushes and they had some. Unfortunately, they were one time use with toothepaste included and tasted horrible but not their fault. Really good location if you are interested in beach activities. Over all a very nice experience for the money."
NEUTRAL,"The Best Western is in a great location, located right along with very hip, trendy hotels - right across the street from the Andaz and up the street from The Standard and a quick walk (or drive if you want to truly be in LA) from the bars and restaurants on Santa Monica. The staff was great, very helpful and knowledgable. And it was easily the least expensive option in the area when I booked my room. That being said, the room is a bit dated. The paint on the wall peeling in spots, the shower curtain spotted and a cockroach in the bathroom at night. Our room, on the downstairs second floor (the hotel is built into the side of the hill, so the lobby is on the third floor and the pool down on the first) had a view of a retaining wall. There was absolutely nothing to see out the window. The room for the complimentary breakfast is far too tiny to fit even a small portion of the guests, so there was cutthroat action trying to get a seat and fight for the food. The sound proofing could also use some work, as it was very easy to hear what was going on in the hallway and in neighboring rooms. Overall, it was a lot of small things that wouldn't necessarily prevent me from booking here, but are good to know to set your expectations at the right level. If you're not going to spend a lot of time in the room and want to be close to the action without having to pay right-in-the-action prices, this is a great hotel for you. Room Tip: Be sure to get a room facing the interior pool courtyard."
NEUTRAL,The trip of a year ended in west Hollywood the last leg of our California vacation booked on my I phone for 300 dollars a night we checked in at 8 pm after driving from San Francisco exhausted and tired from the trip through California mountains the front desk guy wouldn't tell me where to park until I presented him my I'd and credit card so he can show me where to park so i gave him the keys but he gave it back telling me to park it because they don't have valet parking for 15 dollars a night so weird for very nice hotel no valet hmmm So after I parked the car Came back to find my wife tugged all the luggage to are room by herself wtf no bell service finally rooms were nice and clean beds are I'll stiff.
POSITIVE,"Fantastic value! The room was clean, the beds and pillows were comfy, the staff were friendly. We stayed there for 5 nights while alternating between Disneyland and the beach. We would definitely come back. One warning- it is a bit of a walk to get to the front gate of Disneyland (20+ minutes), but it was worth it to us because the hotel was such a great value. Also, the AC unit seemed to have a hard time cooling the room down completely (our visit was in mid August), so the room was a bit on the warm side, but not terrible."
POSITIVE,"We were in Cody to spend a couple of days at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center and had our dog (a two-year-old GWP). We're always glad to find nice accommodations that are pet-friendly. The staff here was excellentâcouldn't have been more helpful and pleasantâand the motel was full. The room was clean, comfortably 'fitted out' and the lighting excellent for us readers. The breakfast was more than 'adequate'. We didn't try the eggs or meat, but the breads, fruits, cereals, etc. were especially nice. Our only criticism is that the breakfast area is woefully inadequate space when the motel is full. It was downright crowded. We spent three nights and will definitely try to book it again on any return trips to Cody. Incidentally, for doggie day care we highly recommend the Cody Country Bed & Biscuit. Our GWP had a great time and we didn't have to worry about her while the temps were in the mid-nineties. We dropped her off at 0800h and picked her up after dinner. The CCB&B gives its clients a code for entry after regular hours, so our pup spent the days there and nights with us. Room Tip: I don't know how much leeway there is with the 'pet-friendly' rooms, but ours was nice. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"Nice clean hotel with easy walk to State St. The pool was great, small but nice and warm. The staff were very helpful and we were picked up right on time to get to the Santa Barbara airport on time. The Green herons who nest in the trees across the street were our nocturnal chatty neighbors but we got to kind of enjoy there chatter. We will visit again. Room Tip: We enjoyed the view of the harbor and will ask for this again"
POSITIVE,"stayed there with my family and found every thing about this hotel exceptional. Rooms were great, breakfast was surprisingly good and staff unbelievably nice. Recommend to one and all!"
NEGATIVE,"Very old, very tired. In need of cleaning and renovation. Great location if money is put into the facitlity."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Best Western Gardens Hotel in Twentynine Palms for one night on March 16, 2012. This was a good midpoint between Death Valley and San Diego via the Mojave and Joshua Tree. The Hotel is undergoing renovations and you can tell our room has recently been redone. The hallways were all freshly painted and they were about to install the carpeting. We were met with cookies and water and thanked for being part of the Best Western reward program. Our room was nice and as I mentioned it had recently been repainted and the bathroom updated. It looked like they were doing that with all the rooms. They had a nice pool and a hot tub that was actually hot. We used the hot tub right before bed and that was just the ticket after a long day of driving and exploring the Mojave. They also have free breakfast that was more than just cereal and yogurt. There were eggs, breakfast sandwiches, bacon, and it looked like they had the capability for waffles. The room had free wifi and a refrigerator and coffee makerâ¦this made getting our day started easier. There was also a hairdryer. The window opened to let in fresh air, but they also had AC. Two fun things to do if you stay there: The first is to drive out in the desert. Just past the hotel, the road turns into a series of dirt roads (no need for 4 wheel drive); most of these roads were even on my Garmin. It was cool to drive around out there and look at the plants and occasionally get out and check out what might be living in one of the holes. We went back out at night to get away from the light pollution and look at the stars. The second thing is to visit the Joshua Tree visitor center in the early evening to look for birds (only a couple of miles away.) There is a little oasis just past the visitor center with a short path (free). In less than an hour we saw more than a dozen species of birds including kestrels, Gambelâs quail, roadrunners, etc. The only complaint we had was a large police dog training session that was going on at the hotel. The dogs were kept in a trailer at the end of our building and barked quite a bit in the early evening. Once we shut the window and turned on the AC, we could no longer hear them. Room Tip: I liked being in the back buiding away from the main road."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is very nice, it's in such a wonderful place and it's affordable. (Even on a budget.) I would highly recommend this to place to anyone and everyone who wants to go Lake Tahoe. I especially liked that the lake was literally 2 minute walk from the room. It was also good to have such a variety of water activities right there! They have boating, jet skiing, para-sailing, kayaking, paddle boating, and more. This hotel was located right in the middle of all the action. There are many places to shop, eat, and just hang out, all which are all with in walking distance. This trip was memorable, mostly because of this resort! Come experience the fun in Tahoe!"
POSITIVE,"Location was great; you just turn off the highway and it's right there. It's right next to a Walmart and surrounded by a nice little neighborhood. The building looks small, but the inside is nice and clean. I was on the first floor so I had no trouble with noises or anything (but I had arrived on a Sunday). The desk ladies were really nice especially [?] when I had the other key when I checked out, and they told me it was ok to just bring it back. Room was clean and had no problems with it."
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our stay there. Great room at Hotel.com pricing & friendly service. Pet friendly and great location on property to walk pets. Only disappointment was that there was no frig or microwave in room as so many Best Westerns have.
POSITIVE,"The staff is friendly and so helpful.Everything is spotless.The room is well equiped with microwave,fridge,etc;Pleasing to the eye and comfy for the body.The location is great with easy access to restaurants and shopping.And my wife loves the fact that they even have a pool. Our number one place to stay in Augusta.A home away from home."
POSITIVE,"The location was perfect, located at the end of Sunset Blvd. near all the dining and lounging locations we had planned for are weekend getaway. Sunday offered an amazing buffet with live Jazz music and the service was outstanding the entireweekend. We would recommend this hotel for any traveler."
POSITIVE,exellent
POSITIVE,Nice view. Helpful staff. Enjoyed the pool and outside bar area. Pros: The view and balcony. Stayed waterfront. Liked the idea of soap dispensers in the shower. Cons: Was overbooked and had to be placed in a suite. Our son had the sofa bed and not a regular bed. They moved another couple to another hotel. Location: Great. Convenient to sites we were visiting.
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable, clean, large king room with sofa bed. I would have liked to have a refrigeratgor to keep the beer cold! Pros: Very comfortable king bed & sitting area. Location: Convient to interstate, shopping, & dining. &lt;30 minutes from SLC International."
NEGATIVE,The food in the restaurant was brutal....not even close to the descriptions of the items on the menu. Cons: The food. Couldn't purchase movies or express checkout. Location: Close to the airport
POSITIVE,"The Plaza Hotel in Longmont was relaxing and our room was large and inviting. We were there for our daughters graduation at CU and we chose to stay there rather than pay exorbinant rates for a lousy room in Boulder and we are glad we did. The property is very relaxing and the staff were very friendly. Our housekeeper made a special trip to get extra coffee packets for my wife when she saw her in the hallway, which was very nice of her. Pros: Very comfortable, large rooms that were nicely decorated. Location: Centrally located to shopping and restaurants."
POSITIVE,If you are looking for a place to stay before a morning flight at DIA this is a great choice. It is not a fancy shmancy place but it is clean and staff are friendly.
NEUTRAL,No thrill hotel. Very good for the price you pay. Clean and convenient. Can't beat the price...
NEGATIVE,"Floor in the room had not been vacumed, toe nails scattered all over it. Door to the room would not close tight, even when locked. Computer area needs updated, keyboards had 4 or 5 keys that had the symbol wore off."
POSITIVE,My son and I came down for an overnight stay while going to the game at Hsbc. Nice clean affordable hotel only 10 mins from the arena. Wifi service to research good places to eat and Shawn was kind enough to give some suggestions even if he is a Sabre fan :)
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was okay. The night person at the desk was pretty rude. The hotel itself is old and not that great of shape, but it's fine if you get in late the night before and are only passing through. I would not stay here more than one night and would not recommend it for business travelers - you can do better. It's a decent budget choice. We had two double rooms with queen beds. The sink is outside the bathroom. Basic breakfast buffet. Parking late at night was a hassle - the lot was full and there was no street parking - took me a while to find a spot a block or two over. Lots of other hotels in the area."
POSITIVE,"The light went out twice, air condition is not under control- means too cold or too warm. King size bed, Sofa, Whirlpool, Unusually large size-Refrigerator are in same area. Bathtub with toilet is in separate room. It is well builded old Hotel, well maintenanced, not central air conditiond. Village Inn restaurant cross the street is excellent restaurant. Food is so good, good price...."
POSITIVE,"free wi-fi and use of computer & printer. Staff was very friendly. Realy appreciate the beer & wine sales, very reasonable. Pros: Entire staff very friendly Location: great location, right off of I-90/94"
NEUTRAL,"Stayed 1 very short night in October 2011 to catch an early morning flight out of Denver. This hotel is incredibly overpriced for what you get (you're essentially paying for its location). Will definitely stay a few miles further away next time in hopes of less noise, cheaper rates, and better service at the front desk."
POSITIVE,"Staff made special accommodations for our family of five, and did so without being asked. Pool was wonderful again, and rooms were immaculate. This is our preferred stay when traveling through DIA and they justified it yet again."
POSITIVE,worth every penny!
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel - clean with nice comfortable bed and free internet for business travelers, also free shuttle to airport"
POSITIVE,"Would give 5 stars if not for the creaky ceilings from upstairs guests. This is our place to stay when traveling ""up north"". Clean, comfortable & well equipped with every necessity. Cottony soft sheets and covers on the beds were heavenly:)) We travel with a pet so need to get take out for dinner...Dairy Queen is only a few steps from the hotel & the food is very good. Room Tip: Since you can hear every squeaky step from the people above you...go for a 3rd floor room. Hopefully they will remedy that! See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Me and my wife always stay here because of the Great Service we get! The location is Great and you are in walking distance of all of the Businesses in town! The room we stay at is large and on the creek. All of the rooms back up to the creek and it is very relaxing! Room Tip: Do not get #433 it is the worst room here!
POSITIVE,"I was extremely surprised to see this Hotel...it was amazing. The location was a little odd but the hotel had a wonderful pool, the rooms were clean and roomy, the front desk area very well decorated and clean, and the breakfast room was HUGE and maybe a little warm but very clean and well stocked. All in all....a great place to stay especially when flying out of the Helena airport. Room Tip: Great Helena Accommodations See more room tips"
POSITIVE,The sfaff was friendly and went above and beyond the call of duty to get us into the room we most desired. The continental breakfast bar was excellent. I loved making my own waffles. Room Tip: Call the hotel yourself instead of using the online rates and request the lowest available price. See more room tips
POSITIVE,"I would stay here again, and would recommend this hotel for my family who come to see me in town or co-worker who come for business."
NEUTRAL,beautiful location and very clean. Our room could have used a carpet replacement. It looked old and worn down.
POSITIVE,"Lets gets things straight, this hotel does not give you the wow factor. It is a mid level priced hotel that gives you what you pay for. The rooms were clean, staff was friendly, and breakfast was above average. If you are looking for a nice affordable place to stay this is a good choice. Room Tip: Alot of food and shopping choices 1 mile east at the Mall area, and ask for a 3rd floor room for a quiet area"
POSITIVE,Travelled all the way across the pacific to have major surgery. Staff and service was excellent. They made every way possible to make sure that me and my family's stay was not only comfortable but also aided in my recovery. Thank you to the staff. Myself and my family will return.
POSITIVE,"I stayed there in the late fall, and for that time of year, it was a good value, clean and friendly."
POSITIVE,"The room was clean with modern furnishings, decor, and nice bedding. The bed was very comfortable, with 4 pillows and a small loveseat sofabed in the king suite. There's a larger dorm size fridge, single-cup coffee maker and small microwave.Very convenient to I-95, walking distance to a few restaurants, groceries, etc. Free breakfast was ok, although we thought the hours were a little early for the weekend (6-9AM). We didn't use the pool or fitness center, but both looked well maintained from casual observation. This is the 4th hotel we've used in this area and would definitely use again."
NEGATIVE,"The room looked clean, but had a slight musty odor. The decor was outdated. The air conditioner was right next to the bathroom sink, getting ready was a very cold experience. The bed was the worst. It sunk several inches when my husband laid down and I kept rolling down into the middle. Finally I put some pillows in the center so that I could stay on my side of the bed. Very uncomfortable."
POSITIVE,"We travelled 26 hours to get from West Australia to Nelson.Needless to say a little taxing.Our bus arrived at 1.30am.Even at that hour the staff could not have been more helpful to my young family.My wife is a clean freak and even she couldn't fault the daily service.Rooms are very spacious , quiet and beds superb as was the standard of cuisine and service at the Hotel restaurant.Big Hi to Shane , Diane and Ash in the restuarant. My only complaint was that we could only stay a week.Will be addressing that on next years visit to this friendly ski town and assuredly will return to the Baker Street Inn. Ian U"
POSITIVE,"Staff extremely helpful at checkin. Although in my 80s we prefer a unit on top floor. They moved our room quickly with great good will. They supply their TV channels on a printed page at checkin as well as restaurant suggestions in nearby area. we went to Mario's Italian restaurant and it was excellent, the food, price and service tops and within 5 minutes of the hotel. Would stay here again anytime"
NEUTRAL,"Wonderful event. Great food. Great people. Thumbs up! However,... a thumbs down goes to Intoxicated Tammy The Bartender of the Summit Lounge who came crashing into not only this event but also inviting herself to the next door wedding reception disrupting the company of guests and making a complete fool out of herself, and perhaps tainting the reputation of the Best Western Inn and Summit of Lander as well. If this was intended to be some kind of comic relief for everybody then somebody please hand me a refund!"
NEGATIVE,"On Dec 9th 2011We received horrible service from the Best Western in Buda Texas. We checked in around 5:30pm put our things in the room and then went out for dinner. While at dinner we found out that my wife's mother had been rushed to the hospital. We returned to the hotel (around 7) to collect our things and I informed the front desk we had to leave due to an emergency and asked if we could get a credit or a partial refund. The owner came out and told me that ""she didn't care"" and when I asked her for her name and to write it on a card she would only give me her 1st name and then proceeded to toss the card in my face. We called customer service and they said there was nothing they could do. Also our non smoking room reeked of cigarette smoke and the entire hotel had a curry smell. We were not asking for much just a little humanity. Other than dropping off our bags we didn't use the room at all. Stay away from this place. Room Tip: Stay far form the lobby as the place stinks of curry."
POSITIVE,This hotel was very well kept and a great price.
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is exactly what u pay for. The staff is very rude lazy and not accomadating at all. The ac is broke so it's steaming hot even in January. The house keeping woman DES marie was very rude told me she didn't have to tell me her last name nd that she can do what she wants when she wants. Hrs later my room still wasnt cleaned. Overall they will NOT get any of my money ever again Disliked: Rooms, Location, Service"
POSITIVE,"My family stayed in a room with one queen size bed and a sleeper sofa. The rooms were nice, clean, and inviting. The indoor water park is great for kids of all ages. The water park thoroughly entertained my two granddaughters who are toddlers. But, kids (and adults) of every age were laughing and really having a great time! The snack bar/cafe inside the water park is reasonably priced with great service. The next morning we had breakfast at the restaurant. The food was excellent and the prices were cheap. All in all, this hotel is a wonderful value and an absolute must for all families with children. Thank you for a great stay!!!"
POSITIVE,We've stayed at this Best Western two different times and each time we stayed for several days. Two years ago we found this to be a very good place to stay and again this Fall we found this to be a great place to stay!! We especially loved the large beautiful gardens and the varied and very tasty breakfasts. Each morning for the four mornings we were there we had a different hot breakfast entree and they also had lots of pastries to choose from. This is by far the best breakfast we've had at a motel and it is as good as many B&Bs. The family who owns and runs this motel is very nice and we enjoyed seeing a glimpse of their beautiful young daughter. The owners live very separate from the guests so we were fortunate to see them at all. Be sure to stroll around the gardens. There are several ACRES!!! And enjoy a WONDERFUL BREAKFAST!
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I stayed here for one night on March 31, and checked out Sunday, April 1. The entire lobby was closed and relocated to one of the ball rooms inside the hotel (prior reviewers thought the renovations may have been completed but as of this past Sunday, they are still going strong). It was inconvenient to heft the luggage up the fire stairs into the hall/ballroom area, but attendants were readily available to lend a hand. Despite the makeshift concierge and check-in desk, everything went smoothly, we were given a complimentary upgrade, and as Best Western members we received a certificate for 10% off our lunch or dinner at their Cafe Pescatore downstairs. The room was one of the best sizes we've encountered in San Francisco (this being our second trip, third hotel in the city) and it was very clean. We asked for a courtyard view room so it would be quieter, but I imagine once you get above the second floor, the view from the street-facing rooms would be very nice. It is a very convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf and restaurants, also. If you plan to stay there any time soon, be advised renovations will be going on. However, if you're using it for one night, or don't plan to be using the lobby a great deal, it suits just fine, especially for the price!! Room Tip: If street noise bothers you, be sure to ask for a courtyard facing room for peace and quiet. You won..."
POSITIVE,The moment I called the hotel for reservations the service at this hotel was exceptional. They got me a room immediately. My stay was 4 nights and I requested a King size room with a Private Balcony overlooking the bay. They did not have it the first few nights but as soon as one was available the staff moved all of my stuff to an amazing room with a view. I did not have to do anything. RJ is one of the front desk personnel and he made sure all of this was put together. He even called me to assure me that a room was available and he put me on the airport shuttle list without me asking. The service was far beyond my expectation and with great people like RJ on staff this hotel will always be filled to capacity! Also the people doing room service are very very nice. Every time I saw them they asked if I needed anything. Room Tip: King size room with private balcony viewing the bay.
POSITIVE,"We spent three nights ,total, at the hotel and found it great. There was a shuttle to and from the airport and there was one arranged to the cruse port (cost was $15.00 per person for the port shuttle). The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with directions etc. The rooms were clean, with coffee maker, fridge, air conditioning, and internet connection. Would recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Room Tip: There is parking lot on the West side of the hotel. A room facing the pool area is recommended."
POSITIVE,"Overall we found the Best Western a good place to stay for a reasonable price. The room did have free Wi-Fi and the people at the front desk were very nice. The free breakfast at the restaurant across from the hotel on the other hand wasn't very good. Several basic items, like regular coffee, were out of stock both mornings. They were filled eventually [?] but, the quality of the food wasn't very good. We would stay there again, but would likely skip the breakfast bar."
NEUTRAL,"Saugatuck and Douglas are tourist destinations, so it's not surprising that there are many nice b & b's around the area. But for those who don't want to spend $150-$250 a night on a room, there are alternatives like the Best Western. It's really not bad - the desk staff was pleasant enough, the continental breakfast was varied and perfectly okay. The pool (although small) is open until 11:00pm which is nice. Still, there was something that always made it seem a bit stale - the smell in the carpets, the lack of amenities, the rough towels, the bare bones quality of many items in the room. If you can get a good price and are looking for a hotel with a pool I would recommend it - otherwise look for something else."
NEUTRAL,"Upon arrival (Friday night of St. Patty's day weekend) there was only 1 person on staff and several people in line and phone ringing off the hook - not adequately staffed and she was obviously very stressed. The comforters and blankets had cigarette burn holes in them, bed was a rock, bathroom was very small and the hotel needs an overhaul - very outdated. Parking lot was a little scarey at night but I did notice the next morning that my rear window had been down all night and nothing was missing out of my car! Room walls are very thin and we could hear our neighbors talking and the smoke detectors blasting off at 6:15am was not a pleasure to wake to especially because it was for absolutely no reason. Very close to WVU's Evansdale campus - big plus! It's okay but definately a budget hotel! Pros: Close proximity to WVU's Evansdale campus and food places. Cons: Parking lot very dark at night, not a lot of parking, small bathrooms Location: Depends what you are visiting - Evansdale campus it's a great location for a short stay!"
POSITIVE,"This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel. It is not the cheapest hotel in the area; however it is value for money. The rooms are âsuitesâ. We were given keys to a room on a high floor as requested, except on entering the room you could clearly hear the toilet cistern running. We rang reception to see if they could send someone to fix it. As it was late there was no-one available. We noticed the room was a decent size, although not quite a suite. There was a sofa, table and chairs, a small kitchen and a double bed. The TV was set so you could swivel it between the sitting area and bed. There did not appear to be much room around the bed. Huge apologies were given and we were offered an alternative room, it was on a lower floor, but as the noise from the cistern would have been annoying and the toilet out of action we had to accept. The room we were given was at the back of the hotel, at the end of a corridor. On entering the room, you entered a small hallway, leading off to the left a large bedroom, with TV, wardrobe and bedside tables. Carrying on along the hall there was a large sitting area, with a large 3 seat sofa, armchair, desk and TV. A table and chairs and small kitchen completed the room. This room was certainly large enough for more than two people; however it had an amazingly tiny bathroom. The door opened but due to the shower rail it didnât open fully. There were plenty of clean towels and toiletries. The rooms were bright and airy, in fact so many windows and curtains to close at night due to being overlooked by private apartments. The breakfast was a typical American continental breakfast. Cereals, muffins, pastries and toast. There were always hard boiled eggs and bananas along with the usual choices of fruit juices and coffee. All in all a pleasant stay, same great service by the staff. The main reason we stay is the location close to metro stations and bars restaurants. If we go to Washington DC again, we will most likely stay here again. Room Tip: ask for one at the back it will be quieter"
POSITIVE,Our room was very clean and spacious. Staff was extremely nice and accomodating. The breakfast was very good. I give this hotel a 5. I could not find anything to complain about. We will stay here again if we return.
POSITIVE,"The room was large and comfortable. The beach was very close, though the outdoor pool was closed. The hotel was in a great location in Dewey Beach. Nothing special, but good value.Pros: Location was excellent, and very reasonably priced. Cons: Location is great, but Dewey beach definitely dies in early November."
POSITIVE,"The lobby was very welcoming and very clean, which is always a plus! The staff was well trained and extremely helpful for our stay, and recommended us to dine at Texas Roadhouse and even got us a 10% discount! Would definitely come back on my next visit!"
POSITIVE,"Let me say up front--My demands for a hotel are minimal--I want a clean, comfortable, convenient and secure place to lay my head at night. I am not looking for frills--I don't use spas, exercise facilities or swimming pools. In this respect, this hotel was excellent. While the room was a little small for 4 people, the great price more than made up for lack of space. Since this was used primarily as a ""home base"" while we visited Galveston, I can;t imagine a hotel which would better meet my needs. Thanks again to the helpful staff for making our trip to Galveston a pleasant experience. Room Tip: Elevator to upper rooms a big plus for anyone having difficulty maneuvering stairs, especially while..."
POSITIVE,"Friendly helpful staff. Very comfortable king bed in large room. Nice and quiet. Hourly shuttle service from 10am to within two blocks of Santa Monica Pier -need to book. Alternatively taxi to beach area around $10. All tours stop at or depart from Pier, some pickup from hotel. Ihop right next door to hotel offering great value wide variety of meals including low calorie options which was great. Gateway is a good option if looking for accomodation a short distance from beach at at lot lower rate than beachfront. Close to lax airport - though we were told was Flat rate $35 for taxi to lax airport we were charged $45 - still fairly reasonable so paid without arguement. No pool and only shared balcony/sundeck on fourth floor. Still you are not far from the famous beaches so this wasn't really an issue for us."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel when we took our daughter to DePaul for auditions for admittance earlier this year. We got the king suite. The suite was incredibly spacious, the bed was very comfortable, and the pillows were good. I was in the middle of negotiations to get my house sold and they allowed me to receive and send faxes during the stay at no additional charge. It's a couple of blocks from a Red Line station so is very convenient to get to transportation. We got a deal on the room when we stayed there that was good, but the rates were nearly $300 per night the other trips we've taken so far. It's difficult to find decent places to stay in Chicago for less than $200 per night so the rates are a general issue rather than an issue with this particular hotel."
POSITIVE,This is the absolute best place to stay in Chicago. Extremely affordable. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The room was very clean and had a great view from our room. The hotel is located just a couple of blocks from a jewel osco and near some great restaurants. And the parking. Free parking!!! We even asked to keep our car there a few hours after check out and they said it was more than ok. Metro stops (bus and rail) are also very close by. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel!!!
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the River North for three nights this past week and couldn't have been more pleased. First of all, the hotel is immaculate, something about which I'm unreasonably particular. Our room (a king plus, I believe it's called) was enormous, with more than enough room for us, our two young adult children and our two visiting grandchildren. The staff was courteous and responsive. One spring on our sofa bed was missing and once we mentioned it to the room cleaner, maintenance was there within five minutes and it was fixed within ten. The location couldn't be better, and, as anyone who's spent time in Chicago knows, the parking is an incredible bonus. We will definitely be back! Thank you! Room Tip: Rooms on the north side seem to be intermittently noisy during the night."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the BW Cavalier for one night only (sadly) on a return trip to the Bay area. Arriving a little after 9pm we were pleased to see there were still fires going in the (3) lovely fire pit seating areas nicely situated atop the overlooking ocean bluff. The moon was quite bright so we were able to use the access stair to walk down to the beach. [?] The location of this hotel couldn't be better and the grounds & amenities very nice. The king bed and pillows were decidedly comfy and the toiletry amenity basket plentiful. The coffee maker was a Kurig with both tea and coffee plugs available. It is also a ""dog friendly"" hotel :o) Only wish we could stay longer and will definitely try to do so in the future!"
POSITIVE,"I was a little nervous about staying here given the mixed reviews, however I was extremely pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and spacious, with lots of amenities. Some rooms have fireplaces which is nice on a chilly night. Each has a mini bar with really reasonable prices, which makes it convenient to grab a cocktail and head out to the yard by the beach and sit in front of the large chimineas that are lit at sunset. It is a pet friendly hotel and we had a lovely time in front of the fire with other guests and their dogs relaxing and watching the sunset/listening to the surf. This is definitely not a luxury hotel, but it is a lovely place in a lovely spot. Steer away from the restaurant unless you are okay with mediocre unimaginative food, although the breakfast there was fine. Pros: The chimineas by the beach and the sunset view are lovely. Cons: Bathroom could use a little updating. Location: Perfect location, but not much around the hotel itself. Good home base for day activities."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel staff was very helpful, they printed directions for us and gave us recomendations to local restaurants. The breakfast area was neat and tidy and well stocked for their guests to enjoy."
POSITIVE,I definitely would recommend this hotel. I had a wonderful stay. Very clean and comfortable rooms.
POSITIVE,A very nice and secluded/quiet hotel for a stay while enroute on a vacation or a business trip. Lots of free parking and easy highway access.Pros: Great secluded location with easy access to highways and shopping.
NEUTRAL,"My friend and I stayed at the Best Western Bay Harbor Hotel earlier this week. It's interesting in that it is essentially an airport hotel on an expressway yet it is on a beach and has a bit of a resort feel to it. The hotel itself is okay. We had a room overlooking the city but try to get a waterview if you can. The sunsets are gorgeous. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The balcony was fairly large. The room had a large flat screen TV as well as a mini-fridge which is quite handy. The bathroom was just average. I did notice some pint peeling on the walls and be advised that the water pressure is not great. The gift shop in the hotel is rather basic. The best part of the hotel is the restaurant/bar called Crabby Bill's. We hit the bar 3 out of 4 nights and it was busy each night. We did not eat or drink inside. We spent our time outside. The outdoor bar is a great beach bar with beach volleyball courts right off of the bar. There was live entertainment one night and beach volleyball leagues going on every night. Large screens TV's are also located at the bar if sports is your thing. The crowd is a good mix of locals, tourists and airline staff. The hotel has a good pool which is located right beside the beach so you can lounge by the pool and stare out into Tampa Bay. The hotel location is okay if you are driving, It is right on the causeway over to Clearwater. Everything is about 15-20 minutes away by car.( Ybor City, the hockey arena, football stadium, Clearwater golf courses etc..). It is however only 10 minutes from the airport. You can walk to Bahama Breeze which is about 15 minutes by foot. It is another restaurant/beach bar right on the water. Whiskey Joe's is very popular and it is a stone's throw from the hotel. It is like Crabby Bill's but a bit more upscale. Be prepared to wait for a table at dinner time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay on the weater but still wants to be close to downtown Tampa and if you love seafood Crabby Bill's is the place for you."
POSITIVE,Excellent hotel Rooms and Lobby Clean Pool wonderful Hot tub terrific Superb complimentary hot breakfast Excellent office staff
POSITIVE,"Just stayed for a night with my wife to catch the Bruins lose a heartbreaker to the Sabres. Was pleasantly surprised with the room quality. Guy at the front desk was very polite. It's in a somewhat crappy and rundown stretch of town, but only 100 yards from the highway, and 5 minutes from downtown Buffalo. I would stay here again, the price is certainly [?] right."
NEUTRAL,We liked the room with 2 queens and a small sitting room. Had a microwave and fridge. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean and roomy for the price. Free breakfast needs some work!!! Not very tasty.
POSITIVE,"Our room was just as we expected, king room, flat tv, fridge & microwave. The shower was different, just a shower stall no tub, but it was clean and water pressure was great. Breakfast in the morning was wonderful with so many options, waffles, eggs, bacon, English muffins, toast, muffins, juices, milk, and cereal. It was easy access from the highway and there is a restaurant right next door."
POSITIVE,Our stay at your Hotel was very satisfing and one of the best we have ever stayed at
POSITIVE,Wonderful breakfast. Very nice room
NEUTRAL,"First off I want to say that this is by no means the Waldorf Astoria and shouldn't be compared to as such but it is a decent place to lay your head for a GREAT price. I too was skeptical about staying here because all of the bad reviews I read on this website, well let me say that when we got here the place wasn't horrible as people put it. The room was clean, cold (due to the a/c on) and the room keys WORKED. I must admit the breakfast was cold that's because the sign says that the eggs and sausage patties are just that cold and needed to be heated in the microwave which by the way they have 2. To sum it up if you want to save money and stay at a hotel to just sleep then by far this is the best place for the money. If you are used to luxury this $50 a night hotel booked through priceline is not for you. So book it and enjoy saving your hard earned money!!!!!! Room Tip: If you book on priceline follow up with hotel because in PA they still have smoking rooms and you may wind up in 1. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the BW Plus Beach View Lodge for 10 days, while my Son and his partner attended Project Walk Carlsbad, a spinal cord recovery facility. The location of the hotel is fantastic although an older building the rooms were large, clean and very comfortable. I had the standard room no 60, fantastic position right at the end of the hotel near the beach. The staff were sensational and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel, the front balcony overlooking the sea is the place to be for sun baking and watching the magnificent sunset. Thoroughly recommend this hotel..."
POSITIVE,"The hotel looks and feels new, weather it was remodeled or just a new hotel I could not tell. The staff was courteous, and they had a nighttime security guard in the parking lot watching the cars and entrance that was very friendly. (it was new years and we were coming and going all night) The room had a brand new fridge and microwave. Every room has [?] a spacious balcony with chairs (the view is just of a parking lot, but its still a balcony) . The restaurant downstairs had one of the best breakfasts ive had in a long time. Everyone was very friendly all around."
NEGATIVE,"Way overpriced especially for the accomodations. Â  Furnishings show a lot of wear and tear and bathroom has strong mold smell. Â We liked that we could rent for one night, as compared to 2 or 3 night minimum stays at other hotels. However, I couldn't see staying here more than one night. The lobby was very nice, decorated for the holidays. Nice touch with the in-room fireplace."
POSITIVE,"Great Hotel! Very Affordable, Right off the freeway. Very Quite, Room was nice and clean. Very Comfortable. Will Definitely stay again!!!! :)"
POSITIVE,"This hotel offers very clean, standard size rooms with comfortable beds, a microwave and a small fridge in each room. Late in the evening on a weekday, the parking lot was full, so it looks like the hotel is very popular.The pool and spa were clean. One half of the pool is indoor, and the other half is outdoor (pool hours 9am-9pm). There were no poolÂ towels available when we got to the pool in the morning, although we saw the bin for ""used pool towels""-I guess they do exist. The breakfast was decent, but by 9 am they run out of hash browns-my son, who is allergic to dairy and eggs, was disappoined as he had a very limited choice of food (breakfast time 6-11 am, btw). There is a Mary Callender's restaurant next door, and you get 10% off your bill if you stay at this hotel. We booked a room with two queen beds and a fireplace. The electric fireplace did not work-the maintenance guy came right away, but was not able to fix the issue. He promised a reduced room rate for this inconvenience (I have not checked yet if they really did it). Our overall impression from the hotel was good, and I'd recommend it."
NEGATIVE,"Staff enter the wrong date into the system and had me down for a no-show. The first room the floor was wet and smelled bad so the hotel changed our room. The second room was dirty, the wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom, the title was loose, the phone did not work, and my husband cleaned the a/c filter for the a/c to work."
POSITIVE,"The hotel and everything about it was wonderful. Staff were friendly, room was updated, clean and very comfortable. Great pool and restaurant as well as free continental breakfast. I can't say anything but good about our stay in this hotel!"
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our 1 night stay @ this hotel more than our 4 nights aboard our Carnival Cruise. & the food @ Wiskey Joe's accross the water was better than anything we had on the ship. Next time we'll just save our money & come stay @ The Best Western Bay Harbor instead of going on a cruise.
POSITIVE,"We thourougly enjoyed our vacation, and this hotel was absolutely perfect. Right across Disneyland which made it awesome. The weather was hot and humid so I had to take the kids back to the hotel for a nap. So convienence. Ate at IHOP and Captain Kidd which they just loved. The hotel staff were friendly and room was in working order and very clean. Would stay here again. Have no complaints and the price was right!!"
POSITIVE,"Everything is great, the only shortcoming is the fintness center. All the equipments inside does not work properly, which is unfortunate. That is why it is a 4 instead of 5. However, the hotel is new and IMHO it is better than a lot of 3 and even 4 star in Edmonton"
POSITIVE,"Room was clean & comfortable. Bath tub showed wear, but was clean. Std amenities, coffe maker, very limited cable, good internet connection, Bath products were nice & coffe in lobby 24/7 Pool was very nice & clean. Hotel staff excellent. Had us on a 2nd floor, I asked for a 1st floor because my dauger was sick. The did not hesitate to get us in to a 1st floor room, and that was a god send Will stay again! Room Tip: Just ask"
POSITIVE,room was very basic but was close to all hotel amenities. Front desk staff friendly and helpfulPros: Close to restaurants and shopping. Cons: Room was very small and basic. Pull out sofa bed was broken and very uncomfortable. Hairdryer did not work.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean and rooms were comfortable and they had a good variety of things to choose from @ breakfast. The only issue I had was with the noise. We were on the bottom floor and the noise from ppl walking upstairs was very loud. Also, we were in the room that is adjacent with the cocktail lounge & heard a lot of banging on our wall. I would [?] recommend taking a room on the second floor if you stay here."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here one night. Staff are very friendly, helpful and thorough. It could use some updating but there is nothing to complain about, breakfast did the job well and for those rough mornings - plenty of coffee available. As one person said - a good choice for Welland!"
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable stay. Very convenient that Denny's is in the same parking lot. Friendly staff, good amenities and close to grocery, and pharmacies."
NEGATIVE,"The Best Western Carriage Inn has a great location for getting on and off the 405 freeway but it is advertised as having a dining facility and bar. It has a ""Denny's"" next door and the bar is not longer open. Other than that is was good."
NEUTRAL,"The room was comfortable and adequate for mine and my kids' needs. We wish the heated pool was a little more heated, and the hot tub was not working when we wanted to use it."
NEGATIVE,The staff at the hotel was good but the stay was vey bad. Had to park a mile away and no way but to walk across traffic. the taxi was a disgrace and cost twice what others in our group paid because the driver got lost and had no clue where he wasgoing. All anyone wanted was money. We won't be going back if we can avoid it. Plus money was added to our bill that we did not know would be added but I'd bet you get this all the time. Plus we wanted breakfast and no real place was open so we went out of town on our way home.
POSITIVE,I found Excalibur to be a great value on the strip. The casino and rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. I especially like that they have $5 dollar tables. You don't find that easily on the strip. The buffet was a good value as well.
NEUTRAL,"We came for our honemoon of 20 years. The room was nice. We would recommend Excalaber for any family that is going to Las Vegas, there was a game room for children, and we thought that was very cool."
POSITIVE,"The Hotel and Employees were awesome...The lighting however, in the room was horrible. Too dark to see anything, in the room or bathroom... Pros: Staff Cons: Lighting"
NEGATIVE,"My Husband and I travel to Vegas at least twice a year, Just for fun. We like to try out a different Hotel everytime, so New York New York was next, I was not Impressed at all with the hotel at all. The room we were given was an upgrade so they say when we booked it was for the skyline rooms but when we got there we asked if they had a room with a king bed. The desk said yes and that they would give us an up grade but all they had was a smoking room in the empire tower. We took it thinking it would be nice(,joke was on us.) The room smelled very bad and not from the smoke it smelled like something died in there..... The windows you can't see out of because theres a wall in front of them. Theses room are the worst I have ever seen. I will never stay at New York New York again!!!!"
NEUTRAL,"The A/C was a bit weak, as our room was at the end of a corridor and has a westerly orientation. The gym facilities were pretty basic. We wish we had an electric kettle in our room. The mattress was firm enough for a good night's sleep."
NEGATIVE,"My parents needed hot water for their medication. There is no coffee/tea maker which most hotel provides, we called and was told a charge of $10 would added to our bill."
POSITIVE,This was or first time in Vegas and it was perfect. The whole experience met our expectations and then some it was great!!!! Best time ever!!!!
POSITIVE,Everything was great until the last day when the hotel was on fire and we had to end our trip early.
POSITIVE,I really like it....
NEUTRAL,"This hotel location in Las Vegas is very convenient. There was no coffee machine or hot water server. When we wake up in the morning, we need coffee."
POSITIVE,Friendly vibe and one of the best themes for a hotel on the Strip. Very convenient for visiting everything else.
POSITIVE,Loved the location.the price was good .friendly workers there.I'd stay there again
POSITIVE,Very massive feel to it. Something i did not feel at Trump hotel in Vegas
POSITIVE,"This was our first trip to Vegas so we wanted to stay some place special. The hotel was beautiful. We loved the easy access to shopping and the immenities were unbelievable. The room was spacious and clean and the bed was so comfortable. The only complaint we had was that our room was a little run down; a hole in the wall and the bath fixtures were in desperate need of replacing (shower head didn't move, and the brass finish was coming off the tub fixtures). Overall the room was very nice and the hotel was great. Pros: The shopping!!!!! Cons: Room was a little run down. Location: The location worked for us; close to shopping, short walk to other hotels."
POSITIVE,"Excellent hotel, but no kettle for cup of tea. Will bring travel kettle next time."
POSITIVE,"Super impressed - got an upgrade when we asked...rooms are large and spacious. We were in the Venezia tower and everything seemed very new. Loved the huge bathrooms, and the two TV sets (one in living room space, one in front of bed)"
POSITIVE,"The luxury suite had old couches from the Elvis era. They were warn on the surface but comfortable. They should be replaced. The gold color plated Moen bathroom faucets had some of the plating worn off, replace them. The TV in my room had no picture and it took two times for the maintenance department to come up and get it fixed right. If this is a five star hotel everything should look like new and it didn't. Pros: The bathroom is large Cons: no KENO"
POSITIVE,"The hotel is beautiful and a complimentary refrigerator was provided for medical needs. Housekeeping was not up to par for a 5 star hotel. One day, our room was not made up at all. Upon our return in the pm, we had to call for clean towels which arrived by security. After golf and excursion trips, it would have been nice to have clean towels to use prior to going out for dinner. We were given only 2 bath, 2 hand, 2 wash cloths, and 1 bathroom drinking glass. I don't like reusing a wash cloth after a shower/bath. The ""bar girl"" was rude. She knocked and entered the room to our surprise while I was on my cell phone making a reservation. She rattled every bottle she had and even admitted to dropping some of them. We had not used the mini bar, so there was no need to replinish it. I had to keep asking the person on the phone to repeat themselves, as the bottles made so much noise. No apology from the ""bar girl"" when she left the room. Tickets for ""Phantom"" came with our package. Howerver, one must wait until arrival to use the voucher. Thus, it made it difficult to plan the itinery. We were not able to get our choice of night for the show. The checkout was very ""cold"". Not one word of ""thank you and come again"", just the bottom line of the bill. We had booked two suites too! Luckily, we had a zero balance! I would recommend with caution."
POSITIVE,"WE THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU STAY IN THIS HOTEL, IT IS NOT GOOD TO TAKE A RESSORTFEE. Pros: Grande canale Shopping Location: The Location IS very Good, it IS ON the Strip"
POSITIVE,"Very clean rooms, excellent room service, beautiful hotel--if we ever go back to Vegas we will stay in this hotel again"
POSITIVE,"My friends and I were in town for one Saturday night and reserved a Rialto Suite at the Venetian. The staff welcomed us into their beautiful hotel and made sure we were taken care of. Navigation in and around the hotel was easy and the room was beautiful. The ONLY drawback? If you do not book a room with a view you have absolutely no semblance of a view (go figure). Our window framed a gorgeous expanse of beige stucco wall complete with access ladder! But if you go to Vegas with the intent of going out and only using the room to sleep - as we did - then this is a minor flaw in an otherwise perfect stay. The black out curtains were fantastic and the beds were divine, everything we needed after living it up!"
POSITIVE,Highly recommend...Not gamblers - -so much to do and not gamble for 10 hours a day!
POSITIVE,"The Venetian is a great place to stay in Vegas with a large group. Â You can get rooms on hotwire for as little as $125/night - this is one of the 5 start strip north hotel choices along with Wynn, Encore and Palazzo. Â  The standard rooms are suite style - 2 queen beds, if available, and a pull out queen couch so you can sleep 6 people comfortably. Â Bathrooms are large and comes with a tub and a shower. Â The tub is typically used to hold ice and bottles of alcohol. Â Two sinks and a separate toilet room. Â  I always ask for the tower closer to the Grand Luxe Cafe (I can't remember the name of that one) cause if you end up in the other tower, it's a LONGGG way home after the nightclubs. Â  The Grand Luxe in Venetian is open 24/7. Â There's also Noodle Asia which is open till 3 if you're really craving that beef noodle soup at $10/bowl. Â  The nightclub in Venetian is Tao - not a fan but always a good backup if your plans fall flat at night. Â Tao Beach in the summer - basically an extremely small version of MTV spring break, if you've seen it. Â I like just hanging out in the Venetian pool better - more space, you can still drink, all the same jazz minus the clustereff."
POSITIVE,"Pricey place but you get top quality (very big) rooms even at the base rate. Â The room I checked out had a nice sunken sitting area with couch and desk in front of a huge window with an OK but not spectacular view. Â Huge comfortable King size bed. Â Check in was painless and quick, parking was good, walking around checking out the stores and impressive canal was cool too. Â I really liked this place. Â Huge casino and many restaurants that I must check out next time. Â Easily top three hotel in Vegas."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel. Definitely top five in Vegas. Great places to eat and shop (if you don't mind spending a small fortune). Pretty decent location, there are a lot of things on the strip that are walking distance. PH, Bellagio, Paris, Aria, Cosmopolitan area is more convenient for walking. I like that it's not part of MGM or Harrahs/Ceasars (whatever they're calling it now). I think most of the strip casinos were better before MGM or Harrahs got their hands on them."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is amazing. Â When we went to check-in I was immediately impressed. Â Beautiful decor, very elegant and true to it's name. Â The lady who checked us in was really nice and very helpful with all of my questions. Plenty of things to do inside the Venetian, fine dining, theater, ride the gondolas, shop, etc. The first day we got there, we spent all day inside. I'm not a gambler, only my friends are, so I can't comment on the quality of the casino, but walking through it and hanging out with my friends, I did notice one thing that set it apart from the other casinos: Â it did not reek of cigarettes. Â A few other casinos were pretty bad when it came to that, but I was able to breathe comfortably at the Venetian. The rooms were amazing. Â They are all suites, and even the smallest choice is still pretty big. Â There were a few things that could be fixed, like the dim lighting and bad wi-fi connection, but I didn't stay in the rooms long enough for it to become an annoyance. I do wish that the towels and robes were a little bit more plush, but then again, it's a small thing compared to the overall greatness of this place. Â  All in all, I had a great time and would definitely come back here again and recommend it to all of my friends and family."
POSITIVE,Overall very positive although I did not like the fact that I had to walk from the main lobby through all the smoke in the casino to get to elevators that took me to the rooms.
POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Venetian! The rooms were clean, quiet, and the staff was extremely friendly. Loved my stay and will definitely be staying there again!"
POSITIVE,super hotel. Everything well taken care off and good service. One of the more modern and best looking hotels on The Strip.
POSITIVE,"We were with another party and had asked for rooms together, but when we checked in, they charged us extra every night to be together and then they only had us on the same floor, not together. But we still paid extra."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I are frequent travelers (first time to Las Vegas) and are very apprehensive about staying somewhere new for the first time as I'm sure most of us are. My wife has allergies and we both like, and demand, CLEAN! We stayed five days at the Venetian and from the moment we walked through the doors to the moment five days later when we left all we can say is OUTSTANDING! Everyone, and I mean everyone from the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, shops, resturants, gondoliers, performers, workers, casino and security personnel were friendly and helpful. Wether it was day or night and no matter what the question or request all were there to answer and help. The Venetian is beautiful. The way I would put it is the Venetian is a city - under one roof. Terrific restrurants, wonderful shops and plenty of entertainment. The location of the Venetian on the strip is really great. Other than tours we walked everywhere we wanted to go including shows. Kudo's to Venetian's management and all the wonderful people we met. As I stated we stayed five days and that's the rating I give the Venetian - FIVE STARS! One final note worth knowing, my wife became ill one night at 3:20AM and to my (and my wife's) great relief the the Venetian's 24 hour Apothecary saved the day. Pros: Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet very clean rooms"
POSITIVE,"The hotel sported beautiful rooms, a great casino, but EVERYWHERE in the hotel was pumped a nauseatingly sweet fragrance. The rooms were incredibly large, but the cleanliness did not match the stateliness. Pros: Quiet Cons: room deoderizer was horrible"
POSITIVE,"Loved it! Pros: Friendly staff, and great restaurants! Cons: Hard to find a reasonably price restaurant/quick eat."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I decided to get away for a weekend in March. As usual the Venetian was a great stay. In the middle of March Madness we were able to get a good deal through their promotional e-mails. Our stays here have always been pleasant with good service, perfect location and large rooms. However, the rooms are starting to show their age. The Venetian should consider room renovations to compete with the newer resorts."
POSITIVE,"i've stayed at hotels where they clean top to bottom each day. venetian is not one of them. we left a few bucks for the housekeeper each day and she would do the bare minimum. tuck our bedsheets/give us new towels, throw out the garbage, and refill the toiletries. however, she failed to mop/wipe/dust/sweep. i noticed my hair on the floor still there and wet stains that dried up along with crumbs. i know this is my own mess but given that this is a 5 star resort i expect more. we stayed in two king bed luxury suites and we checked in at 12AM and they only had 1 room ready. they told us to come back for the other room in about half hr. wth??? in addition, they were doing construction near the parking lot garages so it felt a little funky walking through all the mess as a guest at a 5 star hotel. also when you first check in you have to walk through SO much (the garage leads to the shops which then leads through an area in front of the TAO lounge, and then through the casino and into the lobby) unless you took a cab and came through the front. that was a pretty big hassle because we had to walk through loads of people starting their night around midnight waiting for TAO to open! and there wer alraedy a bunch of drunkards waiting to party. well i took off a whole star because of these complaints. our room was so large that we never even really stepped foot into the living room area. if you had a queen luxury suite you can probably sleep 6-8 people comfortably. i am not even lying. the rooms are definiltey dark and lack lamps or light swtiches! but the bathroom is gorgeous and although i would never touch a bathtub in public places it looked super comfy! haha. i'm a standup shower type of person! loved the rooms at the venetian although my bed was a tad mushy for my liking, i also loved the elevators but the bellagio does it better. the location is more toward the end of the strip toward freemont st. so its not exactly in the middle of all the action. i bought my whole vegas trip with RT flight package from expedia so my cost for the luxury king room came out to less than $100 a night !! i just wished my $20 sandwich worked (see note below)! owell theres always next time! Room Tip: anyway i heard about the famous $20 sandwich so of course i had to try it. rumor has it that you sli..."
POSITIVE,"have just returned from a one week holiday at the Venetian, we stayed in the venezia tower and loved it, the hotel is extremely large and you can have difficulty in finding your way around it, as we found out after check in, the receptionist explained to us where our room was but after a ten and a half hour flight it went in one ear and out of the other, lucky one of the security guards took pity on us and showed us the way, after a couple of days you get used to the lay out but it can be a bit daunting at first, for example we were on the first floor Venezia tower which is on the tenth floor of the Venetian tower (baffled,so were we). We visited the new hotels that have just been built on the strip and though they are lovely they could be in any city, where as you get the feeling that the Venetian could have only have been built in Vegas, so if you that Vegas experience and don't mind a bit of cheesiness stay at the Venetian. For any one living in the north west of England if you like the Trafford Centre you will love the Venetian."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel, like the layouts of the rooms, and having free wi-fi. When (I was the after Christmas 2011) I think it was just my room that needed some fixing up, as we had a broken shower door, and phone, and safe. Everything else was very good though. They have a wonderful work-out room, with a rock climbing wall!, and nice pools in the venician tower. The only problem was the pool in the Venetian tower closed at 4 and opened at 10, so it did not leave much time, if you are one of those people who wants to get out! Since I was underaged I could not use the work out room, which was also a bummer! But the trip was great, and the hotel is very nice :)"
POSITIVE,"I stayed there for my bachelorette party and (don't ask me how!) but we got upgraded to the Reneissance Suite and it was PHENOMENAL!!! We had a great time by the pools (Tao Beach was very much see-and-be-seen, but still fun) and the other pools were lovely, with wonderful service (just please tip well!) Try the red bull and vodka slusies! The gambling was good and the location was great. Honestly, this is a gorgeous hotel, and if you can, I would absolutely stay in one of the suites, as the service is great, and you don't have to stand in the regular check in lines. Also, there are a lot of decent restaurants in the hotel, so you do have some choice. Hope that helps! Will absolutely stay again! The beds were great, too!!"
POSITIVE,"Rooms were not cheap (in the 230 range) - stayed in the Palazzo rooms - we stayed with friends so we had 2 queen beds in the room - view was good, room was nice and clean, but wireless was really slow. Good location, restaurant decent, and the pools were nice - cabana was great with TV, food, and shade."
NEUTRAL,"Before we left I requested a room with a view.Mentioned it was our 25th wedding anniversary.When we checked in they said we have you in a room on the 4th floor but if we upgrade they could do better.It really wasn`t worth $45 a day extra and next time won`t fall for the scam.Everytime our neighbours used their water we heard a girgling sound in our sink.It was all hours of the day and night,so needless to say our sleep was disrupted.The bed was comfy,but the rooms decor,(rugs,bathroom fixtures etc,) could use some upgrading.Plus when the wind blew it whistled through the window.It was very windy one night,we thought our windows were going to blow out,plus we didn`t get sleep because of the whistling.The staff were very nice.We found most of the restaurants within the two hotels were pricey.The Grand Lux cafe was the best deal for your buck.We did complain about our disruptive noises so they took the resort fees off.Be prepared to walk alot from one end of the hotel to the other.Very easy to get lost.It would have been nice to have a bottle of wine or something waiting for us because it was our 25th anniversary,maybe chocolates,champagne,no acknowledgement at all. Room Tip: Be close to the elevators,don`t pay for upgrade"
POSITIVE,"The location was great, although the road noise was particularly loud during morning rush hour. (I didn't ask to get moved.) The bar on-site is only open Friday & Saturday evenings, so no cocktails to accompany room service delivered by Denny's. The hotel was clean but a little worn. The staff were friendly and helpful. All in all, not a bad place to spend a few days in Encino."
POSITIVE,"We had visited Knoebel's during the day and just wanted a quiet, clean place to stay overnight. We arrived at about 11:00 at night and were checked in very quickly and efficiently. Our room was on the second floor. The elevator was very slow and there were already people waiting for it, so we took the stairs. Our room was nice and clean, but pretty basic. Two double beds, tv, small dresser and a small two person table. The bathroom was very clean and well appointed. Our room overlooked an industrial area, but we never heard any noise. The complimentary breakfast was very nice. They had eggs, sausage, bread, yogurt, fruit cups, a waffle station and cold cereal. We would stay here again!"
POSITIVE,"Decor and all of the ameneties. Perfect for hitting the freeway the next morning. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while traveling with our dog. It had all of the ameneties we like when we're on the road (ie. small fridge, coffee maker, large screen TV, plenty of hangers, ironing board, nicely decorated, etc.). Bonus feature was the coupon for the free very good breakfast at the restaurant next door."
POSITIVE,"Quiet, comfortable and affordable. Easy access to and from Chicago and the surrounding burbs."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel several times. We travel through Clayton several times a year and this is our preferred hotel. We would like to stay in Dalhart, Texas, but will travel the extra miles at the end of a long day to stay at this hotel. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We are usually exhausted when we check in and they are so kind and get us checked in as fast as possible. The rooms are always clean and have been decorated in a nice southwestern style with nice tile flooring and nice bathroom counter-tops. All room have irons/ironing boards. coffeemakers, and hairdryers. There is a dog walking area outside that is the nicest I have ever seen. It even has it's own fire hydrant for the dogs. There is also a ver ice playground for children with a nice wooden jungle gym. The breakfast is very nice serving hot waffles, eggs, biscuits and gravy, pastries, sausage, bacon, hash browns, juices, and coffee. We will continue to make this one of our preferred stops. We have never had one complaint. This is a pet friendly hotel. They even have treats for your pets :)"
POSITIVE,"I loved the linens, comfortable pillows and bedding. For the first time ever, we had enough towels without needing to ask for more. Breakfast was great. Staff friendly. Great temperature control in the rooms."
POSITIVE,"AC was not working well, but I reported it as I checked out and they said they would take care of it. Pros: Decent hot and cold breakfast buffet, cleanest motel in town, near as I can tell. Location: Easy to find and get to."
NEGATIVE,"My wife and children have stayed at this Best Western numerous times and have always had a pleasant time. This time though, I was unable to sleep due to the extremely loud swimming pool area, that was directly underneath our room. I called the front desk and they informed me that the pool area, would be open tell 11. Furthermore the hotel was sold out, so I would not be able to switch my room. I spoke with a manager the following morning and was offered a whole $15 dollar discount for my lack of sleep on my $100 bill. On a side note all of my previous stays I would rank as very good to excellent. Room Tip: Never accept a room over the pool at this hotel."
POSITIVE,"We were happy with our choice to stay at the Best Western Lake Buena Vista Resort. The only thing that I would be able to complain about is the shower. The water temp switched back and forth from cold to hot during every shower. The hotel room was very comfortable, the staff was very friendly, and the hotel is in a great location. I would recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,The bathroom had mold in the tiles of the shower and the plumbing around the toilet was rusty and the bathtub faucet was lose and and needed replaced other than that the bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean. Had a nice balcony view. The taxi service was expensive but they provided bus service for free to the Disney parks only. Pros: Bar by the pool Cons: Too expensive for taxi service if you want to go somewhere besides the Disney parks
NEUTRAL,"Close to mass transit and several museums. The adjoining restaurant, Mei's Kitchen, was excellent. Hotel needs updating, it was clean, but looks a bit 'worn'. Also, cleaning staff starts cleaning before 7:30 A.M.--which is too early if you're on vacation. Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
NEUTRAL,"The hair dryer in our room did not work. Also, the view out the window in the breakfast dining area was of an old run down trailer, not pleasant with your breakfast - suggest they put up a fence and/or plant trees and shrubs or other landscaping to hide the trailers."
POSITIVE,Staff exceptional - prompt reponse to concerns. Exceeded expectations.
POSITIVE,I have stayed at quite a few Best Westerns and this is one of the better properties. The rooms looked updated and were very spacious. We had a new TV in our room - flat panel - very nice. Bathrooms were a bit outdated but very clean. The breakfast was ok - several items to choose from but very crowded. We stayed at the property a week and only had breakfast there twice. The spa was nice but small. The staff at the hotel was very helpful. Will plan to stay here again when I am in the area. Room Tip: We had an upper floor room so we did not hear anyone walking above us.
POSITIVE,"I stayed at this hotel while on business. I stayed a week, and during the entire visit, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. When I returned to my room in the evening, the housekeeping staff had my room looking just like it did when I checked in. The breakfast served was great, and the BISCUITS were the best! I would definately recommend this hotel, ""without reservation""."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Friendly staff, well kept grounds, clean facility, surprising breakfast, and checkout was a breeze."
NEGATIVE,"NOISEY from all the bars and restaurants around. Not recommonded. We rented the place for two night and stayed in two different room. The first room was on the end which was right next to a bar. We could not get to slept until 1:15 AM due to the music and loud patrons. Then the music started again at 7 AM on a Saturday for the a marathon. Also, the beds we very soft. My husband and I couldn't sleep in the same bed. On the second night, we stayed in a different room and it didn't get any better. We could still hear music until 1:15 AM from the bar behind us, the bed was firmer, but the shower and hotel phone didn't work. The only good thing about this hotel in the location to all the shops and restaurants, but then it isn't so good when you have to stay up until 1:15 AM listening to all the music. I wanted a nice relaxing weekend and I didn't get it. This was an horrible experience and definitely not work the money. I will never stay in this hotel again, and not in any hotel in St. Augustine, FL next to any restaurant and bar that plays music all night. Room Tip: None in this hotel. The back of all the rooms were right next to bars and restaurants who played mu..."
NEGATIVE,"See my pictures, there was actual cockroaches in my room, when i complained to the front desk they sent up a cleaner to remove them......no fumigator, not even a wash with bleach.....safe to say we didnt stay."
NEGATIVE,"this hotel is giving bad name to other wise a known hotel chain.BEST WESTERN should look into it seriously. Broken windows,dirty carpet ,bad smell,unfilled shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom.Non working flush."
POSITIVE,What a place! The rooms are huge; the views are incredible. This was a great place for a couples get away.
POSITIVE,"I was satisfied - good value for money, although breakfast is very basic, rooms small but OK, clean."
NEGATIVE,"We booked this hotel for my sons 10th birthday. When we arrived, we were told that the pool was out of order and had been for weeks. They were not willing to even give us a discount on the room. They sent us to another hotel that was owned by them, and that hotel was disgusting and so was the pool. Needless to say, we did not stay at either hotel. This was a horrible experiencefor 10 year old son. ...Cons: The pool was out of order and nobody bothered to let us know. They were not willing to give discount on the room."
POSITIVE,"Located a short distance from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Cannery Row there were plenty of restaurants and places to walk. The coast was beautiful. The hotel was quiet, clean and the service was great."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here 2 nights. The first night was because the roads were dangerous due to a storm, but the second night was just because we loved it so much! The hotel is gorgeous! There is a lovely indoor courtyard and pool. Our room was right next to the pool, and we went swimming 3 times in the day and a half we stayed. The free breakfast was delicious, and way more than we expected. We LOVED staying here!! We also loved the on-site restaurant ""Mulligan's."" The food was excellent!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel has a great service staff, specially the always-smiling short haired woman at the front desk. She answered all my questions, which where quite a few, in a polite and amiable manner. I think she mentioned she had just started working there and I let her know that she was doing an excellent job. I would definitely stay there next time I am in Leesburg."
POSITIVE,"sue and I and our dog,pepper, have stayed at this motel for 8 years and have always found the service excellent and our room comfortable and quiet. we are always greeted in a very friendly manner and pepper is made to feel right at home. we are usually here 3 times a year to see sue's mother who is at Jennings mccall nearby and just celebratred her 103rd birthday! Room Tip: there are special rooms for people with dogs"
POSITIVE,"Staff very friendly. I booked on expedia so check in took a matter of 2 minutes. Great view of Wet and Wild with a distant view of Universal. There is a small arcade which the kids liked, only 4 or 5 machines but nice. Over all, great stay. If we come back to orlando will definately look at coming back."
POSITIVE,"The service and comfort of this hotel was great, I couldn't have picked a better hotel. I defenetly give it a 5 star, would recomended to anyone, and most defenetly will stay here again. Great sleep, good breakfast, clean, perfect."
POSITIVE,"Overall it was great. Would suggest that they improve the lighting in the bathroom in the shower, once the shower curtain is closed it blocks out all the light. In general though, I was very very impressed with the overall quality. And the free breakfast in the morning was delicious icing on the cake.Pros: Staff was very friendly, room was clean and comfy. Cons: Hard to see in the shower, Location required driving around a little bit off the beaten path."
POSITIVE,Pros: I was very happy with customer A plus for service. Cons: The onion ring were burn.
POSITIVE,"Very pleased! Clean and comfortable, lots of space. Refrigerator and microwave were great surprise the kids loved popcorn for a midnight snack. Staff was friendly, continental breakfast was surprisingly waffles and biscuit and gravy another nice surprise when expecting a bagel. We will be stopping here again on our way home.Pros: Awesome room for value!"
POSITIVE,"I love Priceline and I got a great price for this hotel room. What I don't like is being treated like a low class business traveler and put in an undesirable room. The hotel staff intentionally put me in a freeway (noisy) close room. The free breakfast was less than desirable. They had eggs which were rubbery, sausage which wasn't freshly cooked and cheap looking pastries andbread. It is unfortunate as this is close to my office when I travel but not worth the money or the hassle. ...Pros: It is convenient to my office when I travel. Cons: Noisy rooms and less than expected."
POSITIVE,"Love staying at this hotel. Have stayed here in several occasions and have never had a problem!! Children love the pool and I always love the rooms. The only thing I would love is a log burning fireplace, but I understand why they don't have them. You won't be disappointed."
POSITIVE,"Great experience. Nice staff, very accommodating. Very clean & comfortable rooms, very good breakfast. I stayed over Christmas, & New Years. Best location. I will definitely stay again & recommend to anyone."
NEUTRAL,Breakfast.... Comfort and design of the room considering the price of it.
POSITIVE,Pros: The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Cons: We were on the third floor and the hallways were very hot. Air conditioning not working properly.
POSITIVE,"The value here was evident the moment we arrived. Our room was clean and quiet, even though it's near Hunter and automall & shopping mall. The convenience of location for our purposes was perfect and we would go back to this Best Western. Due to the downturn in our economy we needed to find a big bargain: we found it."
POSITIVE,"Excellent, friendly service. Beautiful swimming pool and leisure facilities. Easy parking and walk into town. Generous, fresh breakfast. Comfortable beds, but room a bit small. Beautifully clean. Room a bit small."
NEUTRAL,Bar Dining area very comfortable and the swimming pool is excellent We had room 26 which was a little cramped and the bed was quite hard and uncomfortable which is unsual for your hotels.
POSITIVE,Everything was excellent. I would not hesitate to return.
POSITIVE,"We would most definitely stay here again. The room was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It wasnt a large room, but we were only there to sleep. Great hotel for the price!!"
POSITIVE,"Our first time to New Orleans - the hotel offered the ""New Orleans"" feeling and was just far enough away for the nightlife to make it quiet, but we were able to walk to everything. The service was good, the staff was friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to sleep while seeing New Orleans."
POSITIVE,"I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and booked this hotel for 2 nights for a stay in town on vacation. I reinforce this is a great choice. The hotel is not new but it was renovated. The sound proofing could be improved since you can hear some noise in the morning. The beds are clean, the tv is new, and so are the coffee maker, and the microwave oven. There is a full breakfast meaning really full with lots of choices. However, the staffing is the best. They are attentive, friendly, and professional."
POSITIVE,"My room was very nice with a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee pot. The bed and bedding were especially comfortable - down comforter and nice down pillows. The breakfast was perfect and had plenty to offer. My only complaint is that the front desk personnel whom I encountered (two different people on two different occasions) were less than hospitable. They acted as though I should feel privileged that they were helping me in the first place. They were not friendly or welcoming and did not provide me with any information about the hotel amenities (breakfast, pool, exercise room, etc). It is such a shame because good customer service doesn't cost anything."
POSITIVE,My family and I had a wonderful stay! great service and hospitality. We are looking forward to staying again!
NEUTRAL,"Just okay! We paid a little extra for an ocean view and we got one, but we had to look over the ratty roof of the building in front of us to see it. The hotel has seen better days but it was good enough for what we paid."
POSITIVE,"I am so thankful to this hotel. We had such a bad experience with the Econo Lodge across the street and decided to try this one out. VERY pleased. Friendly staff and also the room was clean, smelt great, and was very comfortable. High Priced, but definitely worth it if you are looking for a nice place to stay. You could see the waterfront from our room! Highly recommended."
POSITIVE,"I have to confess that I stayed at the Best Western Inner Harbour on points, But I know how much it would have cost, and there was a pretentious fancy hotel next door nearly that would have cost way way more. The Inner Harbour looked exactly the same and was inexpensive and included really handy parking. We paid a nominal charge for use of a full kitchen and were directed to a great supermarket, so we ate wonderfuly in the room. We used the Fairmont Empress, five minutes away--OK, ten minutes--as our bar. The Inner Harbour had a little pool in the back yard which was just enough for a refesher. The people in the hotel were lovely and we had a wonderful time. The beds were super. Why would you want to spend more for a fancy schmancy name when you could stay here??!! Room Tip: I would take a room in the back which faces the harbour. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We don't live terribly far away, but chose to stay here knowing we were having a rare night out, so no worry about a bit of wine and driving. It made me feel like we WERE on a holiday, and I can see why the Best Western Plus Inner Harbour is so popular. Excellent location, friendly and efficient staff, spotless roomos with all we needed. And even a beautiful little kitchen tucked around a corner. Bright room with balcony, free and easy secured parking...I only hope we have another excuse to go and stay again soon. This place seems to know what hospitality is about and does it well."
POSITIVE,"We regularly stay in Best Westerns throughout Canada and the U.S. and have rarely been unsatisfied, but the Best Western Inner Harbour is one of the best ones that we've stayed at. The staff were all very cordial, the room was A-1, and the area was perfect for us. Room Tip: The corner rooms are the best, with two balconies and lots of light. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Nice clean place. Good location. Friendly accommodating staff
NEGATIVE,this hotel was so cheap. the bed really sucked. and there was a blood mark on the sheets. the room was so cold and they didnt give us a thicker sheet. the water would gather on the bathroom floor. the towels were too little.
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. Loved the free breakfast and it had lots of options. Was a little upset that the sauna was locked when we went to use it but didn't say anything about it because it was close to check out time anyway, Room was comfortable and spacious. Staff was accommodating to let us check in early and was even able to get a late check out. Pros: free breakfast! Cons: Distance from the mall and having to pay a toll every time we left and came back."
POSITIVE,I really enjoyed my stay at the Best Western Conference center and Hotel in Baltimore. The room was comfortable and had more amenities than I had expected. The bathroom was spacious and clean; the lock box was unexpected but greatly appreciated. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Not once did I get the feeling that I was taking them away from something more important when I called about something trivial. The shuttle service was late occasionally but the drivers were friendly and willing to drop me off at places not included on the shuttle runs. The free continental breakfast was great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone taking a weekend trip to Baltimore.
POSITIVE,"Wonderful stay, quiet, clean , The pool was the Best Iv'e been in ! Really enjoyed our stay!!"
POSITIVE,"Very nice room and a plearure to stay would do it again, very clean and neat"
NEGATIVE,I liked the fitness center even though it was small. I did not like that my beds contained bed bugs. Also the house keepers did not change our sheets.
POSITIVE,"This hotel has blown me away. Location is minutes from Seaworld (walking) with Lynx bus access to all parks. The room I had beats Disney pop century and gets close to the highest standards. Huge flat screen tv, full size fridge and safe, coffee machine etc. You name it you got it. Shower is a luxury walk in and big enough for 2. I think you can ignore any adverse review below as the refurb has transformed a good hotel into something much better. My bed wasnt hard but very comfortable. I haven't checked out yet but so far I am absolutely amazed at the value this offers. I am not easily pleased (see my review of the Village In) next door. Don't hesitate to book this as the rates must start to get higher. I can't believe the rate I got thru Expedia. And the staff are absolutely great. Not gushing but willing and able to do everything they can. My IPad didn't connect to the wi fi in the room. Within a day the company that installed the system had been contacted and I am now writing this on my iPad in the hotel. The is no reason to go anywhere else. This hotel is fantastic."
NEUTRAL,"Our stay was great -- we were comfortable and enjoyed the ease of the stay. Only complaint was there were gnats in the sink (odd) but other than that, the room was clean. Great location, esp for the price"
NEGATIVE,I was suprised when I arrived and it was one of those hotels that you enter your room from the parking lot. It was clean and the staff was good. Average breakfast with a very nice girl who makes the waffels for you.
POSITIVE,I stayed here for the third time within one year at this hotel and I still find the location one of the best beside the price. Only two things this time were some ants in my room and being on the first floor near tha entrance was not so great. Atnight I heard voice and rumble from quest and staff moving around. Good that after nearly 24 hours of trip I was exhausted to not be really distrubed by it but I will surely request another room the next time if they put me in the same one.
POSITIVE,Were very happy with the service from the front desk to the worker very friendly. Older hotel put very well kept-up. Need to update the TV's. Close to many attractions and restaurants. Near outlet mall.
POSITIVE,"The property was well kept and front desk was helpful. The description on Orbiz led me to believe it was a newer hotel. It said, new in 2009 executive suites. Did not like the outside doors. At 2:00 in the morning one night, some guys decidedto talk loud right near our door."
POSITIVE,"Spotless rooms, very comfortable pillow top beds, super pillows, nicely decorated, granite, flat screen, free wifi, free breakfast, really nice front desk staff, nice little fitness center, great price!!! Â You just cannot ask for a better deal!!"
NEUTRAL,"I'm a business person and my wife and I were traveling on business related matters. With being a professional and a member of the modern world I only check-in to hotels that offer a WiFi service so that I can do work from the hotel. Not only was the WiFi at this location not available for my entire stay but when I called to complain I was given a phone number to a technical support associate in a call center and was then assisting them to troubleshoot the hotels network issues. I should mention that I am an IT Manager so there is no question it was an issue with their network. When I complained further upon check-out of the hotel the associate on duty merely smirked and said, ""Well the WiFi in all hotels is often unreliable.""I was honestly rather satisfied by the ""hotel"" itself but the staff was very unprofessional and obviously had no interest in trying to meet my expectations much less exceed them as most would attempt. I would encourage booking a different hotel even if the expense is more."
NEGATIVE,"My wife and I were staying in town for my best friend's wedding. The wedding day was a hot one in South Bend, the country club where the wedding reception was held did not have adequate air conditioning, leaving all of the guests extremely hot and uncomfortable. By the end of the evening my wife and I were looking forward to coming back to our hotel room, showering and going to sleep in the air conditioning. Unfortunately our night would not end on a relaxing note. We arrived back at the hotel at roughly 12:30AM, as many guests from the wedding did. We weren't in our room more than 5 minutes by the time my wife had hit the shower, and I followed as she removed her make up in the bathroom. As I showered we discussed the wedding, the day's events, the heat, etc. It was then that we thought we heard a noise. We stopped talking to listen closely. We then heard our phone ring. My wife went to answer it and was informed that it was the hotel manager and that we needed to come to the door. My wife quickly threw on clothes to answer the door, but the manager had already started to knock again. My wife answered the door and this is when we met Justin, the night manager. Justin's first words to my wife were ""I'm only going to say this once. I got a noise complaint about your room. If I get called again, you're leaving my hotel"". I thought I had to have heard this wrong through the bathroom door; as I can't imagine anyone, more so a manager, not introducing themselves when they are dealing with customers and just launch into a tirade. I cracked open the bathroom door, as I was nude, to listen to what was happening. Justin spoke to my wife as I do to my 5 year old son when I am scolding him. He went on to say how he received complaints on our room for noise, noise that would be associated with a party. When my wife tried to speak he continually would talk over, interrupt and walk away from her. Needless to say, my wife was in shock as he ended his speech with ""And next time answer the door when I knock"". I quickly got dressed and asked my wife again what had transpired. I was convinced somehow this hadn't just happened. I went to the front desk to speak to Justin myself; when I asked him to explain himself I instantly began to understand how my wife had just been treated, as Justin began to speak to me in the most condescending manner. I tried to explain to him, as my wife tried, that this was an impossibility since we were just two people, more so two people who had just arrived back to our rooms to shower and sleep. But, once again, he continued to speak over me, and threaten that I need to ""let it go or leave the hotel"". I began to walk back to my room, when I was stopped by an aunt of the groom. She was inquiring about what was happening, and this is when Justin left his post behind the desk to interrupt my conversation. He, again, had to explain to the grooms Aunt what had transpired (the complaint, investigation, etc.), as if he wanted her to know his side of the story. She too picked up on his condescending tone, and asked him if he understood that he""comes off as he is talking down to people"". This is when he stated that he had ""just gotten to work and had to deal with this"". Both myself, and the aunt of the groom, looked at him in amazement, as if he was using that as a defense to his inexcusable behavior. I walked off in disgust, as the aunt of the groom did the same, but not before she informed Justin she would be writing a complaint letter. I had to walk back out to our car to grab my tux jacket. I walked back in and saw the bride and groom exiting their room, they both saw that I was visibly upset and asked what was wrong. Not wanting to rehash the events to them on their wedding night, I simply gestured toward Justin. They approached him to ask what had happened. He first disputed that the groom was indeed the groom stating ""you're not the groom, I don't know you"", after my friend assured him he was the groom he once again told them his story. The bride looked at him confused, also sensing that it would be pretty hard for two exhausted people to sound like a ""teenage party"". When she inquired that he may want to apologize to me for his gruff manner he told her ""he doesn't have the right to not respect me or my hotel"". At this point the bride said she refused to deal with him on her wedding night and that she would simply contact the owner of the hotel, to which Justin told her ""I'll give you my name"". I was shocked at how brazen his tone was with the bride! When I look back on this experience I will not think of my best friend's wedding, or the events that surrounded it, I will only think of Justin. He was unbelievably rude, condescending, threatening and harassing. I have never in my life been treated, as a customer, like this by anyone. He left my wife in tears, my friend's family in shock, the bride appalled and myself infuriated."
POSITIVE,"Nice place for the money! Rooms were clean, staff friendly, loved the various seating areas in the surrounding yard, to just relax, within walking distance of a couple restraunts, and a large putt putt golf, which looked to be alot of fun! A short drive to Bar Harbor! Would stay again!"
NEGATIVE,"Great location, convenient to DC metro, but very dirty and poorly maintained rooms. Stay at your own risk."
POSITIVE,This is the place you want to stay. The people are friendly and very helpful. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. This is the best hotel staff I have every seen!
POSITIVE,The kids loved the pool and the mini golf. I loved that the pool was right outside our room. The rooms need some renovating but it wasn't dirty.
POSITIVE,"Very beutiful, good assistance, good emploies."
POSITIVE,Wonderful hotel with great breakfast and great service. A little bit away from everything but worth it. Pros: Rooms were very spacious and clean. Cons: Location.
POSITIVE,"I did not stay at this hotel, but I will give them props for one thing...close access to cheap food and drinks. Â This place houses the just okay, extremely skinny, foot long hot dogs. Â They also have 2 flavors (lime & strawberry) of $1 frozen margaritas. Â I heard the bartender say that they had bottle necks for $1 as well. Â Considering that I don't drink, none of the sipping options were for me, but I appreciate having cheap eats from an establishment. Â Also a Ben & Jerry's that had 2 for 1 cone coupons flooding the strip, along with a huge assortment of cheap souvenirs shirts, hats and more."
POSITIVE,"I love Vegas and go as much as possible, so when my girlfriends who had never been to Vegas suggested a girls getaway I knew where we should go. I had never stayed at the Monte Carlo but had walked past it on the strip many times before. We got a great rate on Expedia for our weekend stay and airfare so it was set. I was impressed with the customer service we received at check in. We had booked a lower floor room, so I wasn't expecting much. However, after telling the girl at the front desk about our horrible experience being delayed at the Phoenix airport for 6 hours she upgraded us to a strip view room on a higher floor. The room was decorated simple but nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The only complaints we had were the bathroom sink drained slow and there was no wifi in the room, only wired internet that I couldn't figure out how to use. Also, the TV kept getting stuck on the menu screen. No big deal, we weren't in Vegas to play online and watch TV. We did have the all day buffet for $40.00 and chose to add the $4.00 cost for all you can drink mimosas at brunch. It was good, but not the best. I'm not sure I would buy the $40.00 buffet again when for $15.00 more you can buy the buffets of buffets and have more options at Harrah's properties for a full 24 hours. We checked out early on our last day and left our luggage at the bell desk, while we went out and played before catching a flight home. The bell desk staff was very friendly. I really enjoyed my stay at Monte Carlo and will probably return in the future."
POSITIVE,"Really live hotel, such a great location, on the strip with a lot near by. The check in staff were pleaseant enough.. the resort fee is a stinger though $15 a night and they change that when you get there! Room was top though, view of the strip and a hot tub. Would recommend the suites. They have wi fi too even the front desk don't seem to know that! Beware of the yard margerita from el diablo they are lethal!"
POSITIVE,"We usually stay across the strip at the MGM, but for this trip we stayed 6 nights at the Monte Carlo. Other than the hard pillows we really like the Monte Carlo and will stay there again. It is conveniently located near the south end and easy walking distance to the center strip. The free tram takes you up to the Bellagio in no time. The casino is decent sized; however, we mostly played blackjack next door at New York New York."
POSITIVE,"The room rate for the Monte Carlo was a little pricier than some of the surrounding hotels, but it made up for it in comfort. The room was nice and clean, the staff was nice, and our stay was quiet.Few things to note if you stay here: Expedia speak notes that the upgraded room is for a King bed. This is only available when you checkin, it is NOT a guarantee. The upgraded room puts you on the upper floors. When the TV turns the volume is at 24 (4 is loud enough to hear, 24 is good if you want to listen to the TV in the shower). Be aware of the ""resort fee"" when booking a room in Las Vegas."
POSITIVE,"The only thing I didn't like about the place is the pool. It's kinda of small and is not for adults, and the service around the pool wasn't that good as well."
POSITIVE,"Not one bad thing to say about this place. I am picky when it comes to hotels and this place was great! It was clean, big and in a great location. The service was excellent, the staff even called right away to make sure that we were happy. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this to anyone! Pros: Great hotel, great service and the beds are soo comfortable! Location: Great spot!"
POSITIVE,Staff resolved some issues that we had very well and in a professsional manner. Hotel room we had was very roomy and wel kept Pros: Professional staff good at resolving queries and issues Cons: Don't try to use the internet access - very pricy if you try Location: Well located at South end of strip near City Central. Means is a little bit of walk to top end but perfectly accessible
NEGATIVE,"It was absolutely disgusting. The room was very dirty and the bathrooms were unclean. We complained, but the hotel refused to change our room. I do not recommend anyone staying at this terrible hotel. Pros: Nothing Cons: Bathrooms Location: Ok"
POSITIVE,"As expected for the price, but you can't beat the location. It is in the center of the Strip where all the accion unfolds. Connceted by tram to Cristal's, Bellagio, Aria etc."
POSITIVE,"Have stayed here before and was keen to come back. We stayed in widescreen rooms both times and they are worth it. Cost wise, it is wonderful value for money. Location on the strip is good and it has good restaurants and easy access to the Luxor and Mandalay bay."
NEUTRAL,"Location is very good for the airport and the strip.Rooms are basic with NO tea or coffee facilities in the room.And had to go down to the lift entreances to purchase an expensive hot tea or coffee,The room we stayed in was smelly and cleaners did try to clear the smell down the drains but with no luck so for our second week we asked to change rooms which they did with out any problems.watch out for the taxi drivers,we got charged $28 when it should have been around $12 if they drive straight there and remember to get the taxi drivers to use the back road behind the MGM which is clear when going up to the top of the strip.They avoid this road so they can get more dollars of you in taxi fares.The buffet was not very good for the money they charge except for deserts,we eat there once for diner but never again.go to hotters over the road behind the tropicana it is 100% better. Room Tip: Ask for a room at the back and on upper floors unless you want to hear the sirens all day and night..."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here in November 2011 with my brother for a short break. Having stayed in Vegas a couple of times before, we wanted a good value hotel that had good access to the strip - and we always find being at the bottom end of the strip to be better than the top, so chose the Excailbur. Our general opinion was that this hotel was extremely good value. The rooms were quite big, clean and comfortable, the location is great (right on Tropicana avenue means you are 15 mins walk to the centre of the strip) and for gambling, the betting limits are lower at the Excalibur than some of the bigger hotels so you can bet for longer without losing all your money on the first night!! The pool was closed when we went which was disappointed as it was still 20 degrees during the day even in November. Other than that, enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel based on the value and location."
NEUTRAL,"Excalibur Hotel was a good deal. Everything was pretty average from the room to the casino. Its on the newer end of the strip. Very close to NY NY, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and MGM. All of which we frequented. We stayed in Tower One but the pool and gym were in Tower Two which was awkward crossing the casino while still wet. Very accessible to buses and trams. There afre so many places to stay in Vegas, I don't see a reason to repeat. Room Tip: Tower Two has better access to the pool and gym."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed at Excalibur for the first time from Jan. 4-8 and just loved it. Everyone was super helpful and very pleasant. Besides check-in being a very long experience and the resort fee we we not aware of I would recommend Excalibur to anyone. We spent alot of time at the hotel bars. Roger, John-John Lee(sp.?) and all the other bartanders made us feel right at home. I had a little incident Saturday morning and needed an ambulance. My husband called security and within seconds they were at our door making sure we were ok. They stayed with us the entire time while paramedics got me ready to go and even had a security officer holding the elevator. This is the main reason we will continue going back to Excalibur. I hope to never see another Las Vegas emergency room but knowing how security handeled the situation made us know we were in good hands. Rosie O."
POSITIVE,Stayed 4 nights in Oct. We were nervous about staying at the Excalibur after reading the reviews about bed bugs but our stay was very nice. We meticulously inspected both our rooms in tower 1 and found no bed bugs. Both rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. Buffets are plentiful if you like that style of eating. Watch out for expired coupons books. Convenient location on the strip. Staff was accommodating.
POSITIVE,"Stayed in March 2011 with my family including my senior mother, middle-aged sister, 21 year old nephew and 16 year old son and a good time was had by all! Enjoyed dining and drinking, some gambling and shopping and saw a couple shows in the Excalibur."
POSITIVE,"Excellent stay at a lovely hotel. The included breakfast is excellent. Comfortable rooms, lots of things included - coffee maker, fridge, tv with LOTS of channels. Friendly staff. Would def stay again."
NEUTRAL,Rooms are kind of dreary but overall clean. We were on a hunting trip and at the end of the day were pretty worn out so we did not use any of the ammenities. The restaurant on site was pretty good for burgers and the service was good. A little overpriced for what you get.
NEGATIVE,"The room was nice, but the bed was not very comfortable. It was a typical hotel room bed. The wi-fi was awful. I spoke with them about it and they gave me a password which was of no use. I had to tap into the wifi of a nearby autodealer. If you need wi-fi, don't come here. Other than the wi-fi and the bed, the room was nice. It was much better than Rodeway Inn across the street. Cons: No free Internet low quality bed unable to consistently connect to wifi"
NEUTRAL,"If I were traveling from NYC to Canada, especially with a family, I would stay here. The rooms are more spacious than most, the internet is free, and the beds good. The interior pool is much larger than most indoor hotel pools with a nice patio area, and there is also a jacuzzi and sauna for the adults and a game area for the kids. Its called a holidome. We came for the pool and enjoyed getting some laps in around the playing children (the lifeguard helped clear a path for us.) A real downside is the pool is not open till 10am- good I guess to keep the noise down, but not so good for those who prefer morning lap swims. We liked having a frig/microwave in our room. We were initially put in a room facing the holidome but the room was dark and smelled of chlorine so we moved to a room facing the river which was far more pleasant. The room was recently redone and quite nice. Although the hotel was full of families, we never heard any noise in the hall or from adjacent rooms. This old hotel must have real walls. We missed the free breakfast we would have gotten at the Hampton Inn but the restaurant prices were not bad, although the coffee was undrinkable. Yuck. Room Tip: Unless you really want to be going in and out of the recreation area a lot, we suggest an exterior r..."
NEGATIVE,"The visit wasnt the greatest. Starting off, the girl behind the desk was hinting that we were there on some sort of internet hook-up, and said very rudely ""If you are still here in the morning... we have breakfast available"". Not sure what shewas getting at - but her attitude was not good. We check into the room - it was a small, smelly and dirty - there were oil stains on the comforter - and the bathroom had a foul odor. When I went outside to get something from my car - she gave me a look like I was doing something wrong. The view of the fresh-kills landfill wasnt too romantic either. On atmospher - I give it a D. Customer Service - D, Clean Room - D, and over all not too happy."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the Wyndham Garden Hotel in NYC for a business trip this past weekend. I was attending the IHMRS at the Javits Center and picked this property do to their price and location to the convention center. Just a few short blocks to the convention center and a few short blocks the other way to time square. Staff was friendly, rooms were decent size for NYC and EXTREMELY clean. No complaints, would easily recommend this hotel to friends and family. I will stay here next year for the conference as well. Thanks for the great stay Wyndham!"
NEGATIVE,"Location It was the worst hotel i've ever been. For 314 dollars I stayed in the smallest room i've ever seen. The bathroom - no comments, awful as well"
POSITIVE,"The Bryant Park Hotel is both close to the action, and a quiet oasis away from the crazyiness of Times Square. I've stayed at a few places right in the middle of it and far prefer the Bryant Park. The room was huge (not just by NYC standards) the bath was, to be cliche, spa-like, and even with an air-shaft view, our stay very pleasant. No elevator noise,Â even though we were close by, no annoying neighbors, no mishaps with the mini-bar. The only complaint I can come up with was that the Cellar Bar was too hip for me, but hey, it's New York, I can find someplace else to go."
POSITIVE,"Our friends used Starwood points to book our rooms for a weekend stay in NYC. Our room was the nicest we have had in NYC! The late night drinks in the bar were wonderful, maid service exceptional, extremely comfortable beds, delicious brunch & outstanding friendly service. Our daughter decided to stay with us on the last night (she lives in Sunnyside) and housekeeping had a roll away bed in our room within minutes. The location is close to Rockefeller Center. We will definitely return!!"
POSITIVE,Great location. Top notch service. Very modern rooms. Boutique Hotel.
POSITIVE,"Thank you for all the good reviews of this hotel, they are really useful when trying to choose out of the thousands of hotels available. We had a great time here, the staff were excellent, rooms a fair size for this city, great views and comfy beds. The hotel even provided umbrella on the day it rained. We did not use the restaurant facilities. The hotel is very clean and new. In a great position within walking distance of Times Sq and the subway. We took the train from JFK to the Port Authority so had a 5 min walk to hotel -ideal. Great rate from the hotel although I did book early and noticed that the price crept up. Would highly recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,"I have spent one week in this amazing hotel. We have contacted them on Facebook and got free upgraded. Our room was on 22nd floor and the view was really nice. The room itself was large enough, perfectly cleaned and equiped by coffee machine, hairdryer and minibar. The bed was very comfortable, there was huge choice of pillows.All the stuff was very friendly and helpfull. Just few things I would improve: 1) the elevator system is really stupid :-) You have to use your room card which takes you only to your floor. As we hade 2 rooms on different floors and the card werenÂ´t working often, we had to go many times to front desk to have the card changed or use the stairs to reach the room of our parents. 2) once we have asked for room service to bring us a breakfast to our room. It came late and my boyfriend got something else than he had ordered, so we were waiting another 15 minutes for the right meal (I understand it can just happen sometimes). 3) ThereÂ´s a shower in most of the rooms which is fixed- so everytime you use it, there comes cold water at first and you get your hair wet even if you donÂ´t want to- I didnÂ´t like this. However it was an excellent stay and I would recommend this hotel to everyone! Room Tip: The higher floor, the better :-)"
POSITIVE,"My husband, teenage son and I stayed four nights in the Distrikt and were very happy with the hotel. The room was spotlessly clean and modern and the staff at the fron desk were extremely helpful. We lost a new iphone on the plane flying to USA and it was very difficult to get help from the airline or a statement from the police. The staff at the Distrikt went out of their way to help, providing advice, lending their fax machine and passing on messages and were always patient, charming and concerned. My only small complaint about the hotel was the noise of the air conditioning unit in our room at night which i overcame with ear plugs. The hotel was in a very convenient location and close to the subway. The street appeared a bit dodgy and is not the prettiest, but we all felt safe returning to the hotel at any time. It was excellent value with a special deal through trip advisor. With two double beds, we all fitted into one room. Room Tip: HIgher rooms appear to get good views but you may not get the special cheap deals on these upper flo..."
POSITIVE,We just returned from New York and our stay at the Distrikt Hotel. We had a great experience. The hotel is new and the rooms are very clean. The staff is very courteous and helpful. It is a two block walk to Times Square where all the action is. The price was very good by New York standards and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an upscale boutique hotel that is reasonably priced. The only negative is that there is a 1/2 block on 40th St. that you have to walk by from Times Square to the hotel that is a bit sketchy. Now having said that we did not encounter any problems and we did feel safe at all times.
POSITIVE,"My wife and I discovered the Distrikt Hotel about two years ago and have now stayed there three times. It is an excellent, small hotel just west of 8th Ave on 40th Street, an ideal location for any midtown activities, especially Theatre. From the minute one walks into the small lobby they are treated by an upbeat and courteous staff. The rooms are exceptionally well appointed and we have found the attention to detail and cleanliness to be excellent. This is not the Plaza, nor does it pretend to be but neither is it one of the dozens and dozens of standard hotels in Midtown which have become very ""tired"" and in which one must gamble on getting ""the good rooms"". All of the rooms here are impeccably well decorated and appointed. The Distrikt is a ""must consider"" for those looking mid range accommodation in Midtown Manhattan. Room Tip: You might want to call the hotel itself and ask about any special rates."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the Distrikt with my 17 year old daughter. From the attention to details (chocolate and weather forecast on our pillows) to the most friendly and helpful staff, our experience was extraordinary. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The entire hotel was very clean. The desk staff, restaurant/bar staff and the rest went out of their way to help us and extend kindness to us. Even my teenager made many comments on the excellent service we were receiving. The location was perfect in that we were close to the theaters, Times Square, restaurant row, subway, bus but on a quieter street. Not once did we feel any threat even walking back late after our Broadway show."
POSITIVE,"I just got back from a 1-night stay with my husband. What a lovely, clean hotel!! The staff is very accommodating and friendly, the rooms are immaculate. This hotel was also convenient to where we wanted to go - right near all the shows, shopping, Times Square, etc. I hope to return soon!! Had a nice stay."
POSITIVE,great showers
POSITIVE,"Top Lage, Sauberkeit, Ã¼beraus freundliches & kompetentes Personal, modern & stilvolle Einrichtung, angenehme AtmosphÃ¤re."
POSITIVE,"The distrikt Hotel is great! Location is great on 40th West street, right in the middle of everything! The personnell is great, very polite, friendly and sincere. The room is big for what I expected, and the housekeeping is very good at keeping it tidy. Breakfast is not included, but can be purchased for $10 and is very nice. The only negative I can say is (but this is almost everywhere in ny) there were definitely bedbugs....I Had a rash and very itchy itchy legs!"
NEUTRAL,I liked the location. I had asked for a twin room 10 months before arrival and was refused my choice due to all booked up!!! I did ask 10 months in advance. When asked if there was any solution I was told no. The queen room did not have a fridge!!!
POSITIVE,"The Staybridge deserves its good reviews. It's well run, still new, and throws in a lot of ""freebies"" like breakfast and a bad wine happy hour on weeknights. It's a convenient location but also a dreary block. All of Times Square is best seen after dark. West 40th remains ugly 24/7. Pros: Nice room, good bed, friendly staff, easy access to the rest of NYC. Cons: Not ""value for money"" but a nicely done hotel on a really ugly street."
NEUTRAL,"This is the first on-line review I have ever written. Actually had a tough experience at this hotel. I was checked into a nice room on the 6th floor. There was a party across the hall. Shortly after 11, I called the front desk to inform them of the noise I could hear from my room explaining that if I could hear it clearly from across the hall, the people in the next room must be afraid to come outside. The smell of marijuana also filled the hallway. Security was dispatched my floor. The guard stood and listened at the party door, but never knocked. She returned to the lobby. After around another half hour, I called the front desk to inform them that I was going to know on their door, they dispatched security again and moved me to another floor. It was a little late, but at least they rectified the problem. The rest of my stay was very pleasant."
POSITIVE,"Excellent hotel, the service was perfect! Everything was as I expected! Really good option in NY."
NEUTRAL,"My wife and I stayed at the Staybridge for two nights over a quick weekend trip. The hotel is quite basic, about what you would expect from a motel adjacent to a highway except this is a couple of blocks from the heart of Times Square. The hotel is just a block away from the Port Authority so there is a ton of pedestrian traffic, not all of it entirely well-behaved or desirable. If you can get past the slightly seedy environs the property itself is clean and satisfactory. There is no on site restaurant but he hotel does provide a buffet breakfast that was included in the nightly rate. The bar is small and only open from 5PM onwards, so if you want a drink any other time you would be out of luck. However, there is a little ""store"" where you can get basics like water, soda, snacks, etc. All said, if you are looking for an inexpensive place to stay within 2 minutes of Times Square, this is a great property. But be prepared for a basic set-up. Room Tip: Definitely ask for a room away from the elevator."
POSITIVE,"Really nice stay. Good sized room( we had king size) free Internet, good breakfast and good location go get to places. Opposite bus station, but our room opened out on the other side as this may have not been as good."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was fantastic, we couldn't have had a more comfortable stay. My boyfriend was visiting from Finland, and really wanted to see NYC, so I booked here because I got a good deal through TravelZoo, and hoped it would be OK. The staff was very friendly and professional, also helpful when you needed it. Our king suite was clean, comfortable and welcoming. The bathroom shower had the right amount of water pressure and consistently hot water, there were plenty of towels available and nice shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap. The hotel has free beer, wine and finger foods from 5-7p during weeknights, which was great considering how expensive things can be in Manhattan! The free breakfast was edible, and had a limited, but OK selection of a hot food, hot side, and lots of bread, fruit, and cereal. The coffee was pretty good! It was quite crowded, but there was additional seating at the bar, and you could always find something. Not fine dining, but again, it got breakfast out of the way, and left a few extra bucks in your pocket. After checkout, the staff locked up our luggage for us, so we could enjoy another full day of sightseeing, which we really appreciated. They also have a very small area next to the front desk that sells snacks and things that's open 24 hours. The items are expensive, but worth it if you get back late at night and need a little something. The location was excellent, its only a very short walk to Times Square, and walkable to most mid-town attractions. It was also very easy to get a taxi right outside of the door. I will definitely stay at Staybridge Suites again, it was everything we needed and exceeded my expectations quite a bit!"
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for 3 nights in late December 2010. The hotel is new and clean and its in a very good location right next to a subway stop and the bus terminal. A five minute walk will take you to Times Square. The room was smaller than I anticipated but it has all new furniture and a kitchen area that I never used anyways. The breakfast is excellent. My only complaints was for my room, the water temperature kept changing in the sinks and the pressure was way too low. And you can pretty well hear every conversation in all the rooms from the hallway and vice versa. Also, the staff is very friendly and will greet you at every opportunity. All in all, its a good place to stay in a nice area."
POSITIVE,"Without question the Staybridge Suites is one of the best values in New York City. It's located just off Time Square on 40th Street. The neighborhood is one in rapid transition and offers a host of good restaurants nearby. (Dean and Dulca is just down the street.) The lobby is bright, cheery and in good upkeep. The check-in staff was young and very eager to help. I found the staff to be very friendly here. My room was outstanding. It was not huge, but it was a nice comfortable size with plenty of room. I had a nice view. Best of all it has a small working kitchen. This would have been super for a longer stay. However I did go down to Dean and Deluca and stock up on drinks and some snacks, so it was great to have a fridge to store them in. The room was in good shape. Colorful and I found everything to be in good working order. I was very impressed to see how the designers had been so thoughtful and careful to design this room in a way of fitting everything in and keeping it feeling open and roomy. For the location, room space and service this was a great value. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend and I would gladly stay here again!"
POSITIVE,Very happy with our stay at this hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful. It is quite difficult to find a hotel that serves breakfast and we were unsure of what to expect but there was plenty of choice and it changed daIly. Is in a good location not very far to walk to times square.
POSITIVE,"From start to finish our trip to New York was perfect and we owe a lot of that to this hotel! We were able to check in early, which after a long transatlantic overnight flight, we were hugely grateful for. Our room was on the 32nd floor and had amazing views of the Empire State Building. We were celebrating a birthday and were warmly welcomed with complimentary wine and chocolates in our room, which we thought was a really nice touch. All of the staff that we interacted with were helpful, pleasant and took a genuine interest in whether we were enjoying our stay. Even maintenance staff greeted us in the elevator and asked how we were, which we've never experienced in other hotels. It seems that with regards to employing staff, this hotel has got it exactly right! We were extremely relieved to find the room was absolutely spotless- seriously couldn't fault a thing. The bathroom was absolutely sparkling and the bed was the comfiest bed I've ever slept in and HUGE! The Tv was great- hundreds of channels to flick through whilst getting ready in the morning and really big. The shower was a really good size, always plenty of very hot water. Breakfast the first morning was a bit chaotic, to be perfectly honest. We took a few mins of circling to find somewhere to sit and it was definitely a free for all. Having said that, the staff were extremely efficient and well mannered in clearing away tables to make more space and replacing food and coffee. The standard of food I thought was great. Hot and cold, plenty of choice and filled us up for many hours, saving a fortune on big lunches. We also would take some muffins and a carton of milk up to the room to keep in the fridge because there's a proper filter coffee machine in every room, which comes in handy after a long day. Every other morning after the first was much better and there were plenty of places to sit and wasn't as busy. The location for us was excellent. A few blocks one way and you're in Times Square and onto Rockefeller Center towards 5th Ave etc. A couple of blocks the other and you're at the river where you can catch the Circle Line boat tours around the island (recommended). I was a bit apprehensive following other reviews that mentioned the street being sketchy and yes admittedly we did see a few suspect characters lurking by the bus terminal, (including one relieving himself against a wall right opposite the hotel) but never felt intimidated or harassed. The area around Times Square is very busy and bustling all the time and the street where the hotel is was always full of tourists walking to and from their hotels so unless you'd prefer a much more upmarket looking street, then I really wouldn't give two seconds' thought about the hotel location. One final thing- maybe because we were on the top floor and so always the first to get in the elevator, but we had absolutely no problem with them at all. I don't know if other guests were just impatient or had bad experiences but we never waited more than a few mins for one, which I think is pretty much a given, since there are so many floors. It definitely never caused a problem for us. Just down the road is a 2 Bros Pizza place where you can get great big slices of pizza for only $1. Recommended! ALso the Shake Shack a few blocks down on the same street as Port Authority parallel to Times Square, does amazing burgers and milkshakes. Overall, a perfect first stay in New York and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a spotlessly clean, warm, friendly, great value hotel with great views and a great location. Room Tip: Highest floors have great views, no street noise can be heard and you get first dibs on the elevator..."
POSITIVE,"Awesome service! The front desk was very pleasant. Whether we were leave, coming back, or needing something, we were always greeted with a smile and very kind attitude. :]Room was very clean, and decent size. Bed was a little firm, but manageable. TVs are up to date, and not boxy. And the complimentary breakfast was perfect.Great stay overall!"
POSITIVE,"It's not the best hotel ever, but it was clean, comfortable, and a $9 cab ride to downtown. Highly recommend - we'll probably stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Recently my wife and I needed a suite for an undetermined period of time due to an accident at our home. I first went to the chain that takes priority club, was not only refused service because they had a policy against renting to anyone who lived within 50 miles but the manager would NOT even come out of the office to talk to me! I then went to the Homewood Suites directly across the street and went in. Kayla in Customer Service talked to me, I explained my dilema & asked if they could help me? She was very positive, went and got Richard Collins, Assistant General Manager. They worked with us, the result we stayed almost 4 weeks, got a better rate than the X Brand, and everyone at this hotel was alway's pleasant to us. Besides the excellent treatment the hotel is new, very nice inside, with a pool, complementary meals 4 nights a week, now we are big fans of the Hilton Chain because they have employees that cared !!! Try these folks out and ask for Kayla or Richard, both are Customer service Specialists in our book !!!! Room Tip: Suite 500 is on the 5th floor, has two rooms, a small kitchen, and comfortable beds."
NEUTRAL,"This Days Inn was just ""ok"". Days Inn - Biltmore East is very, very misleading. Biltmore is about 10 miles away. Was not as nice as the description stated and not very convenient to the center of Ashville."
POSITIVE,The price was right and the staff very helpful. Asked to see the room first and it was clean and comfortable. Nice lobby and good breakfast.
POSITIVE,Would stay there again.Was perfect for our sudden trip and cheap tickets had everything done properly and i will use cheap tickets from now on.
POSITIVE,"We had been in the Mountains all day and we were all very hungry and tired! Went to several other hotels in the area, we needed a room with 2 kings or a king and hide a bed-all the other places only had 2 doubles, (my husband and I are not little people) and we had our granddaughter with us . The prices for 2 doubles were $70-120-HELLO?!? We decided to try Quality and that is exactly what we received!! They had 1 king with a hide a bed in a beauitul suite for only$65-SHOCKED! The breakfast was GREAT, the room was beautiful and clean and the front desk employee was very knowledgeable and kind!! Room Tip: I imagine all their rooms are clean and wonderful!"
POSITIVE,"Have been here twice now on my trip in Orlando. Great hotel with a location that is easy to get around, nice spacious king room with fridge and sink, microwave. Internet is nice and fast and includes breakfast. i found getting to golf courses and back to hotel easy and very quick with access to lots of highways (and only had to take a toll hwy once) Room Tip: ask for a King room as they have the kitchen facilities"
POSITIVE,"I usually stay in Choice Hotel properties when I travel and this is one of the nicest. Very clean, spacious rooms, and minutes after we checked in at about 5 p.m. they put out wine and a vast array of snacks in the breakfast room: frozen pizzas and White Castle burgers in addition to chips, popcorn, cookies, etc. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, too. Capping it off: bargain price with coupon from N.C. Welcome Center."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"This was one of the best extended stay hotels I've ever stayed in. If you've ever been in some of these places, you know how dicey it can be to find a good one, but this is by far THE BEST ONE I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. The service is great and the rooms are CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN! Every time I had a question, the staff would answer it readily and promptly. Some of them even went out of their way to help me! (How often does that normally happen at a hotel?) COMPLETELY DISREGARD these negative reviews. I don't know what they were thinking or maybe they're used to going to $300/night hotels, but whatever their problem is, THEY'RE WRONG! I love this hotel and the next time I'm in High Point, I'm DEFINITELY staying here!!!!! Room Tip: Third floor is great because there's no one above you (no accidental stomping). Also, if you tra..."
POSITIVE,"this is the best place to stay in tahoe, walk to the water, great places to eat, gamble, was a great time,"
NEGATIVE,"Setup like a motel, kinda weird. Greasy carpets, noisy refrigerators, missing remotes and unattractive bathrooms. Pros: Price. Cons: Weird rooms, and not nice bathrooms."
POSITIVE,"Stayed overnight for Christmas while visting relatives. Room was very spacious, clean, quiet and cozy! Didn't like not having a microwave in my room and the heat didn't go ""on/off"". It just stayed on which made it very warm. But rather be warm than freezing. Very good hotel!"
POSITIVE,"I was honestly surprised at how nice this place was for the price. Rooms were very clean, comfortable beds, nicely kept grounds, pleasant staff, and free breakfast. Food wasn't the greatest, but can't complain since it was included in the price. Nice that there is a bar in the hotel. We were able to go back and spend time with other guests after a wedding. Would stay again."
POSITIVE,Stayed here for an Eagles game and for the price it was a good value. Not much around the area but easy access to Philly. Would stay here again!
POSITIVE,"This is always our destination hotel when in Flagstaff. The rooms are comfortable with WiFi and sufficient lighting to work or read. The continental breakfast is always tasty and sufficient choices are available. It seems to have been built with the idea to keep the train noise out and all we ever hear is a deep rumble as the trains go by in the night. Not something that would keep you awake - in Flagstaff its difficult to find any hotel that is not within hearing of the trains since it is a Main Street City with the tracks going along the main street. The daily paper outside your door each morning is a nice extra. Room Tip: Probably further away from the street, but even in room 101 just off the lobby our last stay was qui..."
NEUTRAL,"Its a ok midrange hotel, you get what you pay for.Staff: They are mostly in their own worlds and not what I would call trained ""Customer Service"" professionals. Shuttle drivers may or may not greet you, may or may not assist with your luggage, will seldom offer conversation, but they always expect a tip. Front desk personnel are friendly with each other and may stop talking to help get you checked in. The maidservice is top notch and always offerred a freindly hello or good morning.Deluxe Continental Breakfast: The day I went to check out breakfast they offerred hard boiled eggs, an oatmeal mush, and stale bagels for which I did not find a toaster. The coffee was terrible and there was nothing deluxe or tastey about the breakfast. I never went back!The perks: They do offer free WiFi which I appreciate and can't understand why the more you pay for a hotel room the more expensive wifi accessibility becomes. Wifi should ALWAYS be free in hotels!"
POSITIVE,The hotel is OK but I got a very small room without a desk...
POSITIVE,Stayed to go to New Jersey Devils Game. Nice Hotel within walking distance.
NEGATIVE,"I reserved a none smoking room, but they were going to give me a smoking room, after arguing with the staff they give me an handicap room wich i refused. so finalley after 45 min they give me a room in the lowest level of the hotel which no one has been there in a while."
POSITIVE,"For the location this hotel is in it's a fantastic deal! It's only a 7 minute walk to Penn Station and easy to get to from Newark Airport. The restaurant is nice and you can't beat $4 beers from 4-6pm! We only had appetizers there, but they were very good. The rooms were clean, but nothing fancy. A few of my colleagues had cigarette burns on the comforters of their beds (in non-smoking rooms), but otherwise the room was clean. The wireless seems to be a little spotty. Some of us could access it and some couldn't. Bring your own cat5 cable and you won't have a problem (I didn't check if the front desk had any). I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again myself."
NEGATIVE,Small rooms and extremely loud.
NEUTRAL,Trouble getting picked up from Newark airport. The neighborhood is convenient to Newark Penn Station but otherwise Downtown Newark is not the best neighborhood. The price is reasonable. If you have time to deal with the frustration of waiting for a pick-up and other inconveniences--the price is right.
POSITIVE,"This hotel showed its age in the crumbling plaster on the ceiling of our room, but was otherwise beautiful. The location was perfect for our purposes; they have a shuttle to the Newark Penn Station but it's an easy walk. We called for the shuttle twice when we returned late at night - although the neighborhood is well lit, and seemed safe."
POSITIVE,"I can't say anything bad about this place. The breakfast was the finest you'll find anywhere. It's comfy, clean and quiet. I wish we could have stayed longer."
NEUTRAL,"Rooms are a little run down,hotel could do with addressing the problem before they become shabby, all public areas were very good, good breakfast until 11a.m free shuttle to newark airport and rail station to manhattan are the pluses."
POSITIVE,"We had the nicest hotel...clean rooms...very nice pool for the kids...staff was wonderful...will definitely stay there again...and recommend to anyone who goes there. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"I virtually lived in this hotel this past summer as I awaited delivery of my condo to move back in. I an a veteran of the NYC scene, having lived for 30 years here and raised 5 children. If you want me to show you the best hotel experience for the money in the area, this is it !! The hotel is convenient and strategically located in downtown Newark, adjacent to the beautiful but underutilized New Jersey Performance Arts Center and at walking distance for both Newark Penn Station and the Prudential Center (home of the Devils and the Nets). All, I mean all, hotels in Manhattan are poor value for the money.They are either expensive and overrated or else they are plain bad (still expensive). If you don't mind being at 10 minutes by train on the west side of the Hudson, this the hotel to go. Rooms are comfortable, Staff is attentive but not multilingual (trying to speak to them in a language other than English or Spanish is a challenge). Breakfast is minimal, high calorie and no protein. Gym is adequate and the business center is good and charges a fee for everything except a smile. The restaurant MAIZE adjacent to the lobby of the hotel is outstanding. Its bar is outstanding. I serves Spanish and Portuguese menu modernized to recent american cuisine trends. The hotel operates a shuttle to Liberty Airport (EWR) and Newark Penn Station. If the hotel management can find a way to make it courteous and reliable it would make this hotel unbeatable.In reality the service is at times unreliable and rude. One of the drivers failed to pick me up at the scheduled time at the airport. He arrived 35 minutes late and I later found out he was moonlighting instead of doing its assigned route. The drivers generally complain about not being well paid and therefore want you to get them out of their missery by means of tips which they don't realize are undeserved in their case."
POSITIVE,"I stayed for 1 week in May because I needed to be in this neighborhood. Now Newark is NOT a place that people generally want to be in, but sometimes business requires it. And as Newark goes, I think this is the best hotel taking into account both location, comfort and value. The only other hotel around here that is more upscale and supposedly better than this one is the Hilton at Newark Penn station. But not only is it twice the price (or more), it is located right in front of the station and therefore you don't have ANY room to breath, remember Newark Penn station is VERY seedy. Also, another big negative for me for the Hilton was the windows do not open. At the Robert Treat, you face green space on two sides. One side is a little park, the other side is the front of the Performing Arts venue. The windows open. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. It is quiet (and I am very noise sensitive). There is a restaurant that serves decent food and that is quite a find in downtown Newark. Oh, and it much much better than the restaurant at the Hilton (yes, I ate there too) You can walk to Penn station within 10mins and its perfectly safe to do so, or ask the shuttle to take you. Conclusion : If you have to stay in downtown Newark, there are no downsides to this hotel. p.s. the only reason I rated ""location"" as 1 star is because Newark itself is a dump. But if you are going to stay in Newark, do stay at this hotel."
POSITIVE,"We had a great stay the weekend of Dec. 3rd. When we checked in the lady at the front desk was very nice and helpful. For whatever reason our room was upgraded to the Governors Suite and me and the hubby had a ball in the steam/sauna shower and whirl pool tub, in addition the room was beautiful and we had a great view. The 24hr shuttle to Penn Station was so convenient. We will definitely be going back . Thanks Kris"
NEUTRAL,"Although the room was nice, almost every day we came back mid day to find the room not cleaned yet. (after 3:00pm) They didn't have very good directions, which was a bit of a problem. They did have shuttle service which was nice."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at Best western plus 2/2/ to3/2 in Boca Raton. The service, the staff were exemplary. I would recommend this property to my friends and relatives. Great,spa,.40 inch flat screen.T.V. Hearty breakfast. mY 7TH YEAR and I shall return. Room Tip: Check with the front desk, they are very helpful."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I have just returned from a stay at this hotel. It had a lovely cosy feel it very homely and very welcoming, the staff were so helpful and couldnt do enough for you. Our room was small with en suite but very cosy and room had central heating. The hotel although it looks old it has so much charm and character. We stayed in the suite called the libarary which was above the kitchen so you could hear the extractor fans below but noise was minimal. We jumped a number 7 bus into York town centre which was 10 mins away. The outlet village, York racers, ice rink, York dungeons are all within in 10 mins drive. Hotel is very clean with wonderful staff and it's location is great. We enjoyed it that much we will be going back again ."
POSITIVE,"Very Nice, airport hotel for relaxation till you get your next flight with free shuttle every 30 mins and good food from 3 restaurants available within the hotel :) the hotel has great view and the room was very clean with good service....food was very fresh and breakfast timing was perfect!"
POSITIVE,Pros: It had a comfortable bed and the staff was friendly and helpful.
NEGATIVE,"Noisy pipe system, beds not all that comfortable, reasonably quiet"
NEGATIVE,You really can't beat the location but the hotel left plenty to be desired. The carpet in room was damp to the touch the entire three days. The room smelled of mildew the entire time. Being allergic to mildew this did not make for restful sleep or a comfortable stay. There is shelf over sink and you cant get over sink to wash face without hitting head and making mess. Because I didn't go through the hotel and pay more for the room we ended up with the room that looked out to a blank wall because the indoor pool is in separate building in front parking lot. Because of our view of the wall the room felt closterphobic. The outdoor pool on beach side was freezing even in heat of day. The hot tub was the temperature the pool should have been. When getting free coffee and tea in morning the hot water was brown coming out of the machine. So we passd on both coffee and tea.
POSITIVE,I have never seen a Best Western so nice. I was pleasantly surprised. The amenities and staff were better than I was expecting. Very clean and comfortable. Free shuttle to the PATH train & Newark airport. We did not have breakfast but I bet it was good.
NEUTRAL,my friends and I stayed here for a birthday retreat.. We found ourselves spending more time here then anywhere else. we felt at home. Mr. Patel welcomed us and even kept our rooms close together. Though there was no elevator to the 2nd floor we just spent our time downstairs. Housekeeping the next morning were fast and friendly breakfast was small and there were alot of people.we enjoyed it. This hotel is close to everything.. We were going to get into the pool but it started to rain... so can't complain or compliment on it but it is there. Room Tip: no elevator so first floor is the best.
POSITIVE,"This place was a great stay and I'd definitely stay here again! The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff members were all friendly and professional the breakfast was good and the service was excellent as well. I would recommend them to family and friends. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
NEGATIVE,"We had a 2-night stay planned here. Upon checking in, discovered the room was 81 degrees. Can't sleep in the heat (that's why we live in Alaska!) so informed desk clerk of high temp and that I'd turned heat off; she assured me the temp would be normal in several hours when we were planning on returning. When we returned, room was 79 degrees with heat off. Waited until 9:30 p.m. (while my kids were in bed) for maintenance man to ""fix"" heater. After being ""repaired,"" room still unbearably hot, so I kept the heat off and opened the window (-20 degrees outside). Bathtub had several of someone else's hairs in it. One of the beds had sheets that were also covered with someone else's hairs, from top to bottom. I complained to the desk clerk, and she helped me change the sheets. I asked for a discount upon departure and was given a 15% discount. I felt I should have received the room for free with all the problems we had. And the worst of it was that the hotel was completely booked so they couldn't move us to another room when we first complained! There was hardly a room available anywhere in town that weekend due to many events going on. If you plan to stay at this hotel, book with caution. Insist on a thorough preview of the room first! Room Tip: Preview room first to ensure cleanliness!"
POSITIVE,"Friendly, rooms are clean, beds and pillows are comfortable. Can't hear the outside noises. Breakfast is excellent. A real dollar performer. Convenient location."
POSITIVE,Hotel 5 years old and much nicer than mopst of the well worn older hotels in area and for a reasonable price. Easy to find and close to Lake George attractions and restaurants but you would probably want to use car to get closer . Also a good location to explore the Adirondacks and Vermont.
NEGATIVE,"my wife and i booked our tri to lake george ater my recent return from afghanistan, we get there and have already payed and have to give them $100 for a security hold, and then gave it back fterwards wat was the point we could have trashed it and left, they didnt care that i serve our country and said it was hotel policy.. worse service ever!"
POSITIVE,We booked this hotel as this was our first trip to Louisiana and wasn't sure what exactly to expect. The room we stayed in was very nice and must have been newly remodeled. Another group of friends that we went with said they requested a nonsmoking room - but it must have been one at one time as it smelled like smoke. We mainly wanted to go to French Quarter/downtown N.O. So if you are planning to go downtown its about a 10 minute drive... I suggest taking a cab. The only other bad thing is if you plan to do any type of N.O. tour - they will not pick you up there so you have to go downtown to be picked up for the tour.
NEUTRAL,"A pleasant enough hotel, the rooms were a good size and the top floor rooms have balconies with outdoor furniture which is a fantastic bonus. The beds were very comfortable - our teenage kids said the most comfortable beds ever! Walls are paper thin - I was woken by the occupants of the adjacent room getting up at 5 in the morning. The leisure area was lovely, clean, well equipped and a good size pool. It would have been good if robes were available for us to go to/from our rooms though. Other little things were frustrating - the sink plug was stuck, the TV remote didn't work... not enough of an issue to complain but when we completed the form left in the room about any problems, and handed it in at reception, it didn't get a second glance from the staff! Room Tip: Ask for the top floor if you want a balcony"
POSITIVE,"I cannot provide enough compliments to the owners of this establishment. I was such a comfortable and welcoming place to stay. Myself and three of my girlfriends stayed here for three nights and we all left feeling relaxed, pampered, and eagerly anticipating our next visit. As many of the previous reviews say, this is very much a fabulous bed and breakfast, not a standard hotel. You get way more than what you pay for here! I don't even know where to start! Breakfast was great! A wonderful mix of homemade breads, Belgian waffles, bagels, english muffins, toast, oatmeal, fresh (yummy) fruit, cereal, coffee, milk, juice, hard boiled eggs, etc.! The staff toasted our food for us, made us waffles, brought everything to our table, refilled our coffee regularly, and cleaned up after us - all with a smile and several helpful tips to guide us on our trip through wine country. The owners keep a coupon box full of 2 for 1 wine tasting coupons, free tastings, etc. that was such a nice touch. We found some great deals and they made our trip that much better. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The hot tub was very relaxing and the entire place was just so darn adorable!! One of my favorite parts of the day was the fresh (as in gooey chocolatey deliciously fresh) homemade cookies provided in the evening (around 6pm). The cookies were so so so good. And milk was provided to wash it all down. Yum! My group had a bit of trouble with the company that we booked our winery tour through, and Tom (one of the owners) stepped up to help us salvage our day by calling some of the wineries directly! What a great guy! He went way out of his way to make sure we had a fabulous time, and we did. Can't recommend this place more! :)"
NEUTRAL,"Location: if you are into Broadway stuff this is the ideal place to stay. Very helpful concierge, Jay & Stella. Cordial and efficient f/o staff -Vanessa and a very helpful and jolly doorman - miguel. F&b; is good and reasonably priced. Bathrobes are fabulous! Most of the staff are helpful and pleasant to talk with. Young and vibrant staff. Some rooms a/c system needs to be upgraded."
POSITIVE,"From outside it looks old style, but room was super clean, bed was comfortable.Best part is breakfast. available starting early morning 4:30 AM and everything was super fresh."
NEUTRAL,Staff good will and simpathy Walls dirt and stained/electrical installations
POSITIVE,"Very nice, will return to Best Western"
NEUTRAL,"Location was perfect for shopping, theatres and sight seeing, and surprisingly quiet at night. Room was nice and clean. Shower could have been cleaner and finished to a better quality. When we arrived on a Saturday evening the reception felt like it was in the middle of a night club, very noisy and people drinking and dancing very close by."
POSITIVE,Liked: Rooms
POSITIVE,The accomodations were excellent and the service was great. East access to airport and the Strip were a bonus! Room Tip: Handy to Strip and airport
NEUTRAL,"Clean comfortable rooms, great for the price and close to the Zoo."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is very close to downtown San Diego, clean,comfortable, complementary breakfast and wifi, nice and helpful staff, and yet such a good price! It was definitely a good choice and I really recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,nice huge rooms. my room was a suite and was really nice. it was clean which is very important to me. had a sofa work desk and a fridge. for the price this was a steal. Room Tip: ask for an upgrade
NEGATIVE,Pros: It was cheap. Cons: The room smelled horrible and the maid service was horrible - no towels.
POSITIVE,"I was there for my nephew's wedding. We had a large amount of family and the hotel staff were so nice and accommodating. We wanted somewhere to gather together after the wedding and the owner let us use the unbooked conference room. Nice, clean, safe facility and very comfortable beds! Thank you for making this a memorable trip!!!"
NEUTRAL,"The hotel looks rather new and the room we had was perfect; good bed, nice spacious bathroom, very quiet. When we got in, a few busses arrived at the same time, which caused a lot of hassle with luggage, elevators, etc. Finally we carried our two suitcases three levels up; everybody wanted to catch the elevator at the same time. The next morning, going for breakfast and afterwards when leaving, the same thing happened; no elevator. Oh well, it was good to get some exercise. Breakfast was quite a hassle; too many people, not enough staff to replenish items which had run out."
POSITIVE,This may be the best value I have gotten out of a hotel.
POSITIVE,"Clean an comfortable room. Breakfast was more than sufficient. Wish windows were able to open, weather was lovely. Wish there were more nice restaurants nearby. The seafood one next door was great!"
NEGATIVE,"Only good thing is they accept dogs. Room very small for two double beds. Heating system is hot or cold. MANY better places in the area and not that much more expensive. Not a place for families. Disliked: Rooms, Service, Food"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is generally a good choice if you want to be near the French Quarter. It's on Rampart Street just across the street from Louis Armstrong Park (I was warned not to go in the park after dark). Three blocks to Bourbon Street, and about five blocks to Jackson Square and Cafe du Monde. The room was nice, with a table and chairs, as well as a work desk. It came fully equipped with coffee maker and fridge. My only complaint was the windows. Screws had been inserted to prevent one from opening the windows. I like fresh air, especially when sleeping, and their appeared to be no way to just run the fan on the A/C unit--you had to have heat or cold. In October, you need neither in New Orleans. I went to Rite-Aid and bought a $2 screwdriver and removed the screws. I put them back in before I left. They have a good breakfast with a large breakfast room next to the bar, but make sure you get there before 9:30. They start shutting everything down right at closing time--no wiggle room. The bar is open in the evening, but I never saw more than one or two people there--New Orleans has lots of bars, so no reason to go to the one at the hotel. There's a large pool in an interior courtyard, but I didn't try it. There were lots of Europeans (French and German) staying here. The price on Friday night was a bit high (over $150), but on weeknights it was a pretty good value."
POSITIVE,"A nice place to stay in Lakeview, OR."
POSITIVE,"Stayed in two King's Row rooms in March 2012. Highly recommend getting a room in that section as they all face the ocean directly and have private balconies. Slept with a small window open all night to hear the ocean. So relaxing. The beds were very, very comfy. Kids, parents and grandparents all had a great time. Our only complaint would be that no continental breakfast is provided. Otherwise, a great place to stay (doesn't seem like a Best Western at all, which is a great compliment!)."
POSITIVE,My only suggestion would be to improve the indoor lighting in the rooms. The room was kindo fo dark to try to get some work done. All else very satisfactory.
POSITIVE,"It was a wonderful trip in Orlando. The hotel is very close to famous attractions such as Wet&Wild;, Universal, and International Drive. We walked to the International Drive to get foods and buy tickets to the parks. It took about 10 minutes one way. The room was ok. It's clean, but I personally can't stand the smell of the cleaning product they useÂ for your room. I put the ""do not disturb"" plate on the door for my whole stay. The TV in my room didn't work, but I don't really care much about this. The neighbor next door was very noisy. Sometimes, he/she kept making noise until midnight. Overall, the hotel is great. The location is perfect."
NEUTRAL,"Paid $156 via Hotwire, so I didn't know what I was getting. Not bad. I liked my room-- they tried to renovate but it's a bit dog-eared but serviceable. Keep in mind if you are driving that the area is grid-locked from 4pm to almost 8pm. The walk to Alewife T station isn't too bad. Don't count on availability of their shuttle service."
POSITIVE,"This is the place to stay if you have business in LA or are just visiting. Great location, just 20 miles east of LA. Very convenient to the Doheny Eye Institute and other USC medical facilities. Just 40 miles from the beach at Santa Monica. Six good restaurants within walking distance. Clean rooms, nice staff, reasonable rates. Nice neighborhood."
POSITIVE,Location in Phx next to airport Sky Harbor was very nice had good food but no newspaper or breakfast included so was a little pricey!!
POSITIVE,Only trouble was it didn't have enough parking spaces to accomodate all the guest who had vechicles.
POSITIVE,"Great location, right in the historic district. Easy walk to waterfront, shops, galleries, restaurants, historic homes and buildings. Deserves the ""plus"" appellation on the whole. Rooms had extra touches such as crown modling and chair rails. Good-size fridge, microwave in room. Poured-concrete construction makes it reasonably quiet in terms of room-to-room noise. Nicely landscaped pool. Better-than-average breakfast in terms of what most places offer ""for free"", i.e. included in room price. Duvets on the bed, and sheets, were also above budget-motel quality. The toiletries provided were also above typical budget-motel quality. The staff are cheerful, informative and unfailingly helpful. The breakfast room opens very early on the mornings of events at the nearby Marine Corps base, which is helpful. We wish we could award a five; why couldn't we? Probably the biggest reason is the bathroom plumbing and especially the shower. In order to use the shower head at all we had to tighten ir before use, otherwise the water just poured out of the connector fitting. Tub drainage was very poor. And while the furnishings in the room itself were good, for what we paid the basins need updating. Having a second basin outside the bathroom itself (there is already a bathroom-type counter there but no water or basin) is also an expectation of ours at this price range. The lovely pool was spoiled a bit by not providing any towels in the pool area, something we heard other guests complaining about. One of us found the mattresses rather soft but we recognize that this can be a matter of personal preference. One of us also found the AC unit too noisy, the other thought it typical of motels. So overall, a very positive experience and we would probably choose it again if we visit Beaufort again, some of what may appear to be nitpicks are based on the price of about $130 / night."
POSITIVE,Very clean and large room. Breakfast was excellent.
POSITIVE,Staff was very courteous and pleasant. Rooms were decent and close to beach
POSITIVE,"Very cheap for everything that offers. Easy to find, park and go to the city. Rooms aren't bad. Its not a 5 star hotel, and it doesn't charge you for a 5 star hotel. So don't expect a 5 star hotel."
NEUTRAL,"Came to Virginia Beach on a whim for the night. We wanted waterfront on a budget and this property came up as the best choice in my online search. The online price shown howerver was NOT for a waterfront room, it was for a second property on the other side of the street. We opted to pay a modest additional fee for waterfront. Check in was fast and friendly. Our room was on the 6ht floor which turned out well since it was a cool enough that evening for us to leave the very shallow balcony door open. The sound of the surf lulled us to sleep which would not have been audible from the lower floors. No screens on the doors or windows so I wouldn't advise this if it is buggy. Room was modestly decorated. Clenliness was only fair, especially in the bathroom where there was a good bit of sand hiding in the corners under the vanity and behind the door. Beds and linens were A+. A/C worked well when we used it. During the next day I noticed a bit more lack of attention to detail. Hurricane Irene had given VA Beach a glancing blow two weeks earlier and there were still plenty of sandbags lying around as reminders. We didn't use he pool or restaurant so I can't report on those features. I'd stay again if the price was right."
POSITIVE,"What we all liked best was how friendly all the staff was and how they were always there to help us find tickets, resturants and shopping. The view of the ocean was beautiful as well. We had 2 rooms and 3 cars, and I didnt like having to park my car away from the hotel, I was just hoping I could pay extra and park there but I couldnt."
NEUTRAL,Great for the two days. Looked out at the ocean. Football fans made noise before 10 pm. Restaurant on premises is awful!
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service Disliked: Location"
POSITIVE,"We always stay at your motel when traveling to Traverse City. It is clean, well priced and the extras mean everything. Great staff, always helpful and friendly! This time i even bought pillows to take home.... at a good price. Thank You for making our trip better!! Room Tip: Ask at the desk.....they give wonderful advise"
POSITIVE,"I know the Comfort Inn is a basic hotel but it met all me needs. I was greeted by a friendly front desk lady who was helpful in giving me directions with a smile. The room was very clean and I had a great sleep. They offer a free breakfast which got me going for the day. They also offer free wireless internet. All in all this was a nice stay. The rooms were affordable, clean, quiet, comfortable and close to the highway. I will return again."
POSITIVE,great value
POSITIVE,Room was clean and comfy. Friendly front desk. Morning paper is delivered right to your door. Good location with lots of shopping and restaurant choices.
NEGATIVE,"The bed was very uncomfortable and the coffee pot did not make hot water. Also the bathtub drained very slowly, therefore when showering you would be standing in about 4 inches of water. Pros: quite Cons: breakfast Location: easy access"
POSITIVE,"Very good if you can get it for a low price. Blazing internet speed, and nice bathrooms.Pros: The internet connection speed, and the bathroom. Cons: A cleaning staff member tried to open the door even though there was a privacy sign displayed."
POSITIVE,Booked a double queen on the 3rd floor. Room is huge and clean. Beds were on the hard side. Bath/shower was excellent. Will stay again.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was a little pricey for the overall quality-small fitness room, etc. but the breakfast was better than the average and the front desk clerk was very helpful-Corrie I believe was her name. She took care of our needs."
NEUTRAL,This hotel is average. It seemed clean and the rooms were basic. It met our needs giving us a place to sleep. The location was nice being close to Universal which was where we spent most of our time. It is located off of International Drive which offered less traffic. There was nightly security patrolling the grounds so that made us feel safe when it came to our car. I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Pros: Small, but really nice. Beds were comfortable. Cons: All of the reviews about the danger of the area. I didn't find the area too bad."
POSITIVE,"Old hotel, pool needed cleaning, staff and service ok.Pros: Free parking and breakfast. Cons: Old. Power went out for more than one hour."
POSITIVE,We were extremely tired and were very pleased to get a quiet night of rest ! The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was a much appreciated bonus. The only negative was a slightly lumpy sofabed. The staff was friendly and efficient.Housekeeping was friendly and pleasent.
POSITIVE,this hotel was amazing for the price iwe checked in the day after Christmas for 1 night the lady at the desk was extremely helpful a+++
POSITIVE,"We stayed in standard room with 2 queen beds. Pros Great service and super friendly front staff as well as restaurant staff High ceilings, making the room feel bigger One of the best breakfasts available at a hotel Great price, clean room and good curtains Free wifi with good connection Close to town Con: There is not much room to move around when you have 4 people in it"
NEUTRAL,"Good reasonable location for the Olympic skating center, walk to town and public beach on mirror lake, rooms clean, but main areas stuck in the 60's with a slight musty odor, good size pool, free breakfast was just edible (a lot of sugar and microwave sausage). Next time we would look for a location without the free breakfast"
POSITIVE,"This is a small, quaint hotel that is very well-located if you are visiting the Lincoln Park-Lakeview area. It was clean and well-appointed. The breakfast was not great, but other than that the hotel is very nice."
POSITIVE,"The quality of the free breakfast has to improve, currently I rate it at ""generic"" at best. Also the breakfast ends at 9:00am, that also needs to be addressed. It does have a good location in Calexico."
NEUTRAL,"The room size is big with full size refrigerator, microwave and sink in the kitchen. The low points are we find the pillows to be too small and extremely soft (where your head just sunk in) and you can feel the bed sheet is quite old and notsmooth. The breakfast assortment is good."
POSITIVE,"Very nice place just need to have smoking rooms! The Staff was very friendly and helpfull! There is not much around, but it's a nice place to stop if your on the road. Loved the sound of the river next to it and it has a great indoor pool!"
POSITIVE,All was good except for blankets. They only give thin summer blankets and it gets cold when A/C is on. I have asked for extra blanket and front desk gave me the last one. It seems I was not the only one feeling that blankets could be a little thicker. Other than that everything was fine.
POSITIVE,"My mother, fiance, friend, and I stayed here while in town for a show. The room had 2 queen sized beds and a pull out...So only my mother and I had to share a bed. The bed itself was incredibly comfortable. The bedding (sheets and comforter) were very soft. I fell asleep within minutes of lying down. There is a vanity and sink outside of the bathroom area which made it much easier for 4 people to get cleaned up and ready in the morning. The people at the front desk were very nice. I watched the young man at the desk when we checked in be VERY polite to a woman who was being very demanding and rude...He kept his cool and impressed me. The next morning the woman at the desk was very kind as well. The breakfast provided was hearty. I was very impressed by the breakfast room attendant. She was very friendly and kept the door to the kitchen area open. If you needed something she was easy to spot (although I never noticed anything had run out). Actually, all the housekeepers had nice ""scrubs"" on...Which made them stand out. Room Tip: Opt for the suite if you have more than 2 people in your group"
POSITIVE,I got a great price for this room. room was clean and quiet. breakfast was very good and filling. Would stay here again for sure.
POSITIVE,"We stayed for 1 night and we would go back again. The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond. Our room was very clean and it is a quaint little hotel. We walked to Venice Beach, which wasn't a stroll but a nice long walk through the beautiful canals. The only negative was the hot tub wasn't working when we got back and the pool was extremelyÂ small."
NEUTRAL,We stayed here as it was the closest hotel available to Temecula. It was a bit farther (30 min) from the wineries than I would have liked to drive before going hot air-ballooning at 6:30 in the morning.
NEUTRAL,"Pretty big room. I was there just passing thru and i need a some what decent room at a fair price. This place was it..!!! Dont spend extra on other hotels in the area. I would stay here again, for sure!"
NEGATIVE,"The hotel was ok but if you have other than a compact car don't stay here. The parking is below ground and totally unacceptable. Two very tight turns still downward incline, Garage area is full of pillars that make turning exceptionally difficult. I now have a crease on right rear fender. No parking at street level. To get out the desk clerk had to come out to guide us each step of the way. No restaurants within reasonable walking distance."
POSITIVE,"cleanliness was great, the price was in my budget and i will traveling again soon i will be staying her again"
POSITIVE,I stayed here overnight back in 1988. I love the 60's feel and look. I can't believe it's still here! I would love to return but I haven't been to AZ since.
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in May 2011 as part of a wedding party. Hotel was great. Our room was clean and comfortable. The lounge was fantastic and the bartender was awesome to us, which included a rowdy group of middle aged family members. The area was great for walking during the day, with a few small shops in the area if interested. There was many homeless people around but they never came up to us or bothered us. A completely satisfying stay."
POSITIVE,"We booked this room after refusing to stay at a competitor who placed us in a smoking room. Charleston was sold out for Spoleto. We were happy to drive a little further for a clean, comfortable room."
POSITIVE,"It more than met my expectations for a 2 star hotel.Pros: I liked the fact that it was a suite with bedroom separated from living room & refrig. & microwave. Cons: Free breakfast should be extended to 10:am,it ended promptly at 9:00am."
NEGATIVE,I am amazed that this hotel has 4 stars on your site. It should be one star at the most. It is an overpriced rundown dump with smelly rooms and awful breakfast buffet. My room stunk with a musty smell and even cigarette smoke. I was getting sick to my stomach. The restaurant tables were sticky and disgusting. They did not even have toast at the buffet. You had to get some paper napkins (like fast food restaurants) right by the so called food (none on the tables) and they had tiny plastic knife and forks (like the kind you have at you 10 year old birthday party). Awful experience.
POSITIVE,"There was one problem. The hotel did not have a reservation for me. They finally found that you had informed then that I was reserving a room for November 1 rather than April 26. Fortunately, they were able to move the reservation and accommodate me. I would appreciate an explanation of what happened."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Condition, Service, Had a great buying experience on a 2011 X3"
POSITIVE,"We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the friendly staff. There are some renovations going on but they didn't affect the quality of our stay. We noticed a billboard just before the exit advertising $59.99 per night and decided to give it a try. This was a bargain for what we experienced and would have paid more. Even though the weather prevented us from using it, the pool looked nice. The complementary breakfast was very good and included eggs, sausage, pastries, biscuits and gravy, and a waffle machine. Nice place- highly recommend it!"
POSITIVE,"Great staff, clean comfortable room. Hallway is ugly with peeling wallpaper and water stains."
POSITIVE,"Cons: A one way street, and hard to reach hotel address especially at night time."
POSITIVE,The rooms look clean close everything in the bed so great
POSITIVE,"stayed there recently, so i didnt have to commute to far from Austin for a weekend and this place is so neat. everything inside has been remodeled. the deco is modern and is very functionally for people sharing a room. no hidden nooks for losing things. the staff was pleasant when i called for a question. when i arrived it was fast and friendly. i had a great sleep there. plus, it was so nice and clean."
POSITIVE,we were in room 420 The toilet paper holder was broken and every time you used it it fell off into the metal trash can underneath it and made a huge crashing noise. Otherwise our stay was lovely. Second time we stayed there. Both times were good
POSITIVE,"location is good, close to most places even Hollywood. hotel provide free valet parking 24x7. breakfast is sufficient with some fruit. room is big with one living room, one reading room & balcony and two sets of TV, so kids can watch separate program. eight steps of stairs from level one will kill your muscle if luggage is too much. bath room is extremely small, I could even lay my toiletry on wash basin."
POSITIVE,This was one of the nicer Best Western hotels we stayed in. The service was excellent-the front desk gave directions and recommendations for the sights to see and restaurants. The room was very clean and comfortable. Thank you for your wonderful service!
NEUTRAL,"Rooms were clean & beds were comfortable. The microwave & refrigerator in the room proved very usefull. The Continental Breakfast they offer in the morning was simple & pleasing. The freshly made waffles were a delight. Staff was always cleaningup and attending the area. However the parking lot was tight and hard to park with anything larger then a mid-sized SUV. Location near downtown & convention center was close and mildy easy to get to. For a smaller sized hotel they are doing a wonderfull job. This hotel was exactly what we were looking for. Also, it was one of the best shower heads I've encountered in a hotel."
POSITIVE,"Nearby to Cowboys Stadium in Irving. Clean facility with good customer service, free breakfast and DFW shuttle. A good deal!"
NEUTRAL,"Very disappointed with customer service. I understand it's not always possible to check in early, but I was guaranteed a 3pm check-in and was not able to check in until close to 4pm - after having to check at the front desk repeatedly to see if my room was available."
POSITIVE,"Pros: I love the decor, atmosphere and friendliness of the staff."
POSITIVE,it was agood stay
POSITIVE,"Only stayed one night but the hotel was very nice. There is an indoor pool that we did not use, but we saw a lot of people in there. The breakfast doesn't have much, and the layout is a little odd, but it was still good. The milk is on one side of the room while the cereal and coffee are on the other, not a big deal. Everyone was nice and they even gave my 4 year old a few little toys during breakfast. I would definitely stay again."
NEGATIVE,Typical Hampton Inn but this one needs to be updated. I only stayed one night but I would choose another hotel in the area in the future. This one is dated and the front desk staff isn't the friendliest nor the most efficient. The best thing about this hotel is the shuttle staff that picks you up from the airport. They were efficient and friendly. The room was OK but not great. I paid $119 per night which is too much for this particular Hampton Inn.
NEUTRAL,"The AC unit was very loud when it was on and blowing cool not cold air. If you like it cold its not the place for you. Everything is old school in the rooms ie, tv with about 5 stations WO HBO-PPV. Pros: price Cons: AC, hot room in TX Location: Lots of places to eat in every direction, and just off the hwy 10min from downtown"
POSITIVE,"I was very pleased with this hotel/motel. The room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom which had sufficient counter space. The room was missing a TV channel guide, but that is no big deal. The continental breakfast grew tiresome after 5 days, as the menu never changed, the fruit was canned,Â and the bagels were always blueberry. Even though the cafe is billed as continental breakfast, there were hard boiled eggs. I was told they are updating their menu and redecorating the dining area. There is a gas station directly across the street, and the hotel itself sits next to a modern office building."
NEUTRAL,This is the second time that I have stayed at this hotel. I chose this one because of the location but otherwise there is nothing super special about it other than where it is and the prices.
NEGATIVE,"So there was 4 of us girls who decided to book a package for wine tasting. We had an amazing time out, but being in the hotel wasn't the best. The rooms were very small and we didn't have enough towels for everyone, but they seemed as if they were hesitant to get us more. There was no manager the first night but the day we left he was there but it just so happened to be a little too late. Before we left we decided to get in the pool, why not we were on a get away, until we found...a dead rat floating in the middle of it. We just decided to sit there. Not only that but the pool is supposed to be heated, and is freezing. I informed the manager of the rat and he said ok someone told him. It wasn't shocking, but unacceptable. Well life went on afterwards."
POSITIVE,"Enjoyed our stay, location was perfect..close to Scottsdale Old Town, freeways, yet out of the noise zone, and close to a few cool restaurants. Staff was really helpful... and so friendly... Would stay again..."
POSITIVE,It was a nice experience staying at this hotel. It has everyting we need. The breakfast was very nice. The staff was very friendly. We will stay this hotel next time.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here during a snowstorm when we could not get home. We were happy to find that the Inn had a room for us at the last moment and at a great price (military rate). Room Tip: The rooms are in various buildings around the property, opening to the outside with parking right in..."
POSITIVE,Our travel softball team spent the weekend at the Luxbury and had a great time. They were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and clean and they provided the girls with everything we needed. Thanks!
POSITIVE,"This hotel should be called Hyatt, Hilton or Marriott, not typical Best Western From the lobby, restaurant, Night Club and rooms this hotel is amazing and the staffs service is wonderful. We took the whole family to watch our sons college basketball playoffs. They put us on the first floor next to the pool my twin boys were amazed at the indoor pool and out room opened up to be able to watch them when I and the wife did some laptop work. Room service was fast the food was good if your ever in the area I would stay here, especially if you have young kids."
POSITIVE,This hotel was newer and was clean and neat. The heat has a thermostat so it did not run all the time. The hotel front desk staff (mainly evening shift was who I dealt with)were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is convenient to the airportand other attractions.
POSITIVE,"good deal ,great hotel"
POSITIVE,"WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL TIME IN THIS HOTEL. VERY CONFORTABLE, VERY CLEAN, GOOD BREAKFAST, VERY NICE PEOPLE. I WANT CAME BACK NEXT YEAR TO THIS HOTEL."
POSITIVE,Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Good with giving directions and recommendations. We stayed in the newly built building which has lots of room. Definitely feels comfy and airy - windows that actually open and fluffy soft towels (: Nothing to complain about!
POSITIVE,Location was very good for price and rooms were very clean and recently renovated. Room was micro-small with very little room to even turn around for two people. Breakfast had pretty good selection but the quality was quite poor.
POSITIVE,Friendly staff. Hotel is across from Disneyland - very handy as we came back to our room for a rest before going back to see night Parade which was very good.Dennys is close by and their Smoothies are very good. Free parking is a bonus. Room Tip: Go midweek to avoid crowds but make sure the evening Parade is on.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here during the Tucson Gem Show. The hotel is away from the congestion of the city center, it is quiet and near good restaurants. Our room appeared to have been recently redone and was quite comfortable. The continental breakfast was included in the room price and is great â a hot breakfast! We would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has all the attributes of a large luxury hotel, with none of the hassles, and has a great staff. The breakfast changed daily, and was fresh and delicious. There was a computer to check up on emails or print out boarding passes. The exercise room was more than adequate. The hotel is spotless with excellent beds and furnishings. Looking forwardÂ to another stay!"
POSITIVE,"Its a fairly new hotel, so everything is very new. The hotel was located at a great location for us and close to our destination. Stayed with a 5 year and 5 month old kids and had no problems checking in and checking out. Somebody was always at the front desk to fullfil our request. My daughter wanted to use the pool and there was an employee walking the grounds and he immediately opened the pool gate and within minutes we had towels. The pillows were a little to fluffy for my liking, but thats a personal choice. Overall I would stay here again on any furture trips. Restaurants are about 2 - 5 minutes away. Great Mexican restaurant just 4 minutes away, Los Panchos Tacos on National Blvd. Pros: Close restaurants"
NEUTRAL,"Standard hotel room, with breakfast package , found the breakfast package explained differently from different staff and not very good. We had no hot water for a day and a half as well and front desk staff didn't seem too concerned. Hotel was clean overall, but showing its age. The location was great, being close to the attractions, and having the shuttle was a nice feature. The extra that was charged for a room with a view of the parks was not worth it. You are better of staying in the park to watch them. Room Tip: Lots of hotels in the area so check around."
NEUTRAL,"The beds were very comfortable- very firm and a good amount of pillows. The room was also very clean and was pleasant. The breakfast was disappointing- it was such a tight space to accommodate their guests. There was a family of 9 which took over the whole breakfast nook because of the size of the nook. The coffee was watered down, it was about a hourÂ and a half into breakfast and there were only 2 bagels remaining, one danish, and 4 smaller muffins. The scrambled eggs were okay, along with the biscuits and gravy that was offered. No fruit of any kind was offered as well. If you aren't too picky on the breakfast you will be pleased with the comfort of the room (if you enjoy a firm mattress) and would recommend this hotel if breakfast isn't a factor."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is always full of traveling magazine sales people from out of state, thieves and the occasional meth lab. The police are there all the time and the staff seems to care less. Don't risk it, stay somewhere else."
POSITIVE,"This is a good hotel. It is in a good location, the rooms are spacious, well designed, clean and comfortable. The staff are helpful, particularly John, who always seems prepared to go the extra mile. A good place to stay."
POSITIVE,"We visited the Grand Canyon for spring break with our 3 children. One of which is in a wheelchair. We had a king room with a fold out couch. The room was HUGE. We had so much room even with the extra roll away bed. The staff was friendly. They were a little low on linens because the hotel was booked up. The whole hotel was huge. The kids loved the arcade and bowling alley offered. The beds were comfy. The kids even commented on the good nights sleep (8, 11, 13). Located about a mile from Grand Canyon entrance."
NEUTRAL,"Everything was okay except there was no elevator. Although it was only 2 floor, had to carry my luggage downstairs."
POSITIVE,Very friendly staff and were pet friendly! Clean facilities with very nice breakfast bar.
POSITIVE,"During our recent stay at Best Western Ambassador Suites in Venice, Florida we rediscovered why we keep coming back. This hotel is immaculate and comfortable with a dedicated staff that made sure our stay was the best it could be. The front desk staff, house keeping and grounds keepers all went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Daily breakfast is a popular attraction with a wide variety of items to choose from or you can have them all. Although our visit coincided with Columbus Day we were able to use the pool and found it to sparkle! Room Tip: The hotel is convenient to the Interstate, includes a refrigerator, microwave, and large sofa."
POSITIVE,We went to trout fish all week and found locations within a short drive in all directions.
POSITIVE,"We stay there frequently and know the area. There are convenient restaurants, markets, massage therapy. It is quiet and welll-run and satisfies out needs."
POSITIVE,"Its clean, the price is good, great location !!! Im from brazil and this is always my first choice"
POSITIVE,"roomsize location was good, walking distance to town, shopping We only stayed 1 night on the way through. The room was nice and cofortable, much bigger then we expected/ Walking distance to town. Breakfast very good."
POSITIVE,Site seeing Breakfast was very poor))
NEUTRAL,It was very clean other than hearing the airplanes above your head at night it was not noisy staff was really nice. Our fireplace did not work for both nites we were there and some of the lights in the room were all burnt out
NEGATIVE,Critters Disliked: Rooms
POSITIVE,For parents and family visiting students at SBU this is a convenient and reasonably priced place to stay One problem - wi-fi worked only intermitently
POSITIVE,"Location, breakfast, and pool. Older and can be pricey."
POSITIVE,"Lobby and hallway renovations are underway, so there were some construction areas to work around. Breakfast was moved to a conference room. Not a problem, and should be nice when completed."
POSITIVE,Very nice and clean room. Staff was great and the breakfast was great..
POSITIVE,came to Orlando from England the cost of staying at Windsor inn once known as Sleepy inn was very good the rooms were big and well kept. breakfast was very good liked what I had. Other hotals I stayed at while in the USA was not as good and i did pay more for them. I needed a taxi and they helped me book one. nothing was to much. I did look at the review some were not very good however I do beleive you can not judge a book by its cover you need to try it hot yourself. They are redecorating and inproving the sevices and will be changing the name what I have seen of the changes they will be for the better I am sure. Whould I rebook this hotal - inn the answer is very easy YES but I would book direct and not through a hotal web-site hotal said they will be flexi regarding if I had to cancal and change dates of my stay that I think is very good the service over all was very good I can not say that I was not happy for the 4 days I was they. That to all the staff at Windsor inn once known as Sleepy Inn. Janet Weston from the UK Room Tip: I was on floor 3 and my room was very nice they were decorating the 2 floor while I was there all I...
POSITIVE,"Come and visit this hotel. If you're disappointed, you have a problem because there's nothing to be disappointed about!"
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is owned by the same people the own the best western carraige inn across the street. I always want a hot tub when I get a room. I was informed the hotel across the street had one and yes they do but is has been down for a month. We had the double queen with the extra room that had a sofa bed. I killed my back the first night, the second night I took the mattress off and put it on the floor just as bad. It did not help the mattress was nothing but springs poking me. Room service was the worst. We had to constantly call to have things brought up because they did not put them in our room when they cleaned. There is no informational material in the rooms about there lounge, restaurant etc. The game room for the kids has no games just table and chairs. The restaurant only does rooms service for dinner and charges an 18% delivery fee."
POSITIVE,Staff were great and it is very nice to have a restaurant at the hotel.
POSITIVE,"Great location, room and hotel recently remodeled. Recommend!"
NEUTRAL,"Great location on the beach and close to the Convention Center. Bed was king size and comfortable. Plenty of hot water in the shower. All the good things you would have in a hotel room. We couldn't get any sleep because of the heater in the room. The thermostat is too close to the heater. It would go off for 15-20 seconds, stop, and then 10 minutesÂ later it would do the same thing over and over, all night long."
POSITIVE,"The room, service, cleanliness, and breakfast were outstanding!! In the future we would request a room away from the highway and dumpster, which was emptied in the wee hours of the morning."
POSITIVE,"Extremely well appointed. Rooms well furnished, comfortable, even luxurious; no stinting on the hospitality tray! Staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Excellent location for exploring Norwich, the shops, etc. Breakfast was no included and seemed quite expensive"
POSITIVE,"Comfortable, relatively clean. Printer did not work, so unable to print out airline boarding passes. A little too far away from Indianapolis. Staff generally helpful. Quiet. Limited nearby restaurant availability."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed here with two colleagues for 2 nights on business from the UK. We arrived around dinner time and were booked in straight away - but with no personable service. My room was spacious with the usual king size bed. It was clean, if a little dated and the heating was controlled by a large air-conditioning unit. The positive about this large, noisy unit was that it was manually controlled. The bathroom was clean. The toiletries were of an ok standard but I didn't use them. I met my colleagues for a drink in the bar. I was asked for ID which as a 37 year old woman I found quite offensive - added to the fact I was patronisingly referred to as Miss even though I had my wedding rings on and was older than the bar man! This was surpassed on the second night when my colleagues were asked for ID - they are both in their late forties - and when we questioned why, we were told it was policy. It wasn't until the bar manager came to see us that they were allowed to have the drinks they had ordered. Madness!!!!! Anyway, I digress. We had our drinks but decided to leave the food as the menu was pretty bland and the only conversation taking place was between the bar man and another guest about the basketball game they were paying attention to. We were the only guests in the bar though so I suppose there was not much else going on!! I slept well and the bed was comfy, as I generally find when I am in the States. The shower was easy to operate and of a good temperature. The breaksfast was typcial state-side fair. Not much choice of healthy food, just a small fruit selection and a few yogurts (not low fat). The general choice was pancakes, waffles, 'English' breakfast, a selection of bread and rolls, jam, porridge and french toast. Enough to be going on with! We were served immediately but again, not many other people around so the waiting staff weren't stretched. The really low notes of this stay were my colleague's keys being locked so he could not get back in his room after breakfast on the second day - and being asked for ID to prove who he was so his key could be activated....of course his ID was in his room! The housecleaning department also mislaid my pyjama top, which I am still trying to track down. I have no hope that it will be found so I am hopefully going to be more successful with my compensation. I was initially told, no we cannot find it - sorry. I think the receptionist was slightly surprised when I asked - so how are you going to compensate me? I am still communicating with the hotel staff......update will follow! Overall, there are other hotels in the area so I would not choose this particular one again - unless all the others were full and I had to stay somewhere."
NEGATIVE,Staff are friendly and helpful. I am in my room right now with my husband and daughter who are both fast asleep. The problem is that the thicker curtains do not close or cover the window and they are only for show. The street lights are shining into my room directly in my face through the flimsy sheers. I am in room number 153. I like to face the side the window is on while sleeping and for this reason I will have a very uncomfortable and disruptive sleep. I Can't do much about it at this time since I'm exhausted and the rest of my family is sound asleep. Rooms are kind of small but they are clean. I'm not happy that the hotel is too cheap to have curtains that close all the way! Wifi is too slow here and my emails take forever to open and send.
POSITIVE,The location is good. It is close to some good restaurants and relatively close to Hollywood Blvd. The rooms are clean and functional. There are different room types and you need to know in advance to select the right room otherwise you will be given a budget room that is functional but not cosy. Ask to get a room on Swimming pool level or higher.
POSITIVE,Older model hotel but well maintained with remodeled rooms. Very clean.
NEUTRAL,"we stayed here overnight before a cruise, close to terminal, we were told we would be picked up at airport upon arrival, I phoned when we arrived only to find out that they only pickup from Long beach airport, room was clean, transit across the street, business's in district all have bars on them, , would I stay here again, probably not, will pay a bit more for a more secure area"
POSITIVE,"Great location, very comfortable, awesome breakfast. Would definately stay again! My kids loved it too!"
POSITIVE,"Great beds, and great breakfast.Pros: The breakfast was very good. Cons: The night staff was a less than welcoming."
POSITIVE,"the place was nice enough and the breakfast a plus for the early riser. We were in the area to head up to Crater Lake and while the place was a little hard to find, it had plenty of restaurant choices in the local area. The rooms were clean and overall comfortable."
POSITIVE,"We had an extended stay, everyone was so kind and friendly. Had a great stay, rooms were cleaned every day. The girls at the front desk Diana and Rena always had a great smile every morning. The girls in the breakfast area were always friendly and helpful. The manager Jose is one of a kind, he could help you with what ever you needed or where you had to go. Great asset to this motel. We will stay here again next year. Thanks You All The Heineke's Frank and Arlene Room Tip: Bottom Floor!!! Great to have a good time."
POSITIVE,"We were looking for the cheapest, nicest hotel as close to Disneyland as possible. I would say that this was the best deal for the time of year we went and its literally right next door to the Disneyland parking lot. It was clean and the staffwere great. We were there just to sleep and clean up thought not much else. Definitely wouldnt be my number one choice if I was to hang out in the hotel for any number of days but that was just cause of size and just this weird feeling that things werent really as clean as they appeared. Definitely not a 5 star but again great for the price and location!"
POSITIVE,"Paid a nominal amount to upgrade to an ocean view suite. Very comfortable, great view."
POSITIVE,"I would recommend this motel w/ out any doubts. Very nice and carrying employees. Clean, pretty, good spot, good service, free internet, comfortable, welcoming, don't hesitate!"
POSITIVE,"The Hotel was a pleasant 10 minute walk away from Disneyland. One evening when we were especially tired, we were able to enjoy the Disney Fireworks Display from the Hotel. The rooms were clean and quiet. Some of our family from California met us to enjoy a day at Disneyland and the friendly staff allowed them to park at the Hotel, providing them with a sticker for their car at no extra charge. We recommend the Best Western Plus Pavilions and hope to return there ourselves."
NEUTRAL,"I was so upset when we 1st arrive my fiance had just called to see if room was available and the answer was Yes! When we pulled up to the front door the man that park the cars ask do we have reservations we said no. The 1st thing he said their were no rooms available, I then told him we just called, we he ran in to check I hurry and Call the front dest back and of course, he says Yes king size only I told him ill b right in. Before I Hung up with him the guy came back to my fiance side of the car and said, sorry there r no rooms available. I couldnt believe how this man can lie like that I jump out of the van and yelled I hate when people lie! My feelings were so hurt and the 1st thought that came to my mind, did he do this because I am African-American. Just because it was my son 7th birthday &; he wanted to get in the pool, I went ahead and stay! I couldnt let that man spoil my baby day! May God take away all the evil spirt that in home! We Did Have a great time in the pool and everyone was so nice! Liked: Location, Rooms Disliked: Service"
POSITIVE,"I was very happy that I was satisfied! This place was everything I was looking for, comfort, convenience, quiet, and the most 2 important, PRICE and CLEANLINESS! If you are coming to Atlanta and need reasonable priced and clean and comfortable accommodations, stay here...you won't be disappointed. Oh yeah, and the staff was GREAT!...especially LIsa."
POSITIVE,"Convenient location, clean comfortable rooms, friendly staff, and great prices."
POSITIVE,"The room seemed to be recently renovated, and it was awesome. The staff was friendly, everything was clean and ""looked"" new. Was very quiet even though room was close to elevator, and wifi was good but a bit slow."
NEUTRAL,Price & the brakefast Indoor pool was closed
POSITIVE,Everything exceeded my expectations.
POSITIVE,"Great, very helpful staff overall...Rooms were up to date & nice & clean. The pool atrium was very nice to be in morning & evening. Though the sauna is away from the pool & hottub, so it's a little difficult to find/access. Feel the front desk should of told us (as their paying customers) that the pool would be taped off & emptied 1st thing in the morning.Â Luckily we didn't stay the 3rd night (Monday was President's Day), as we wouldn't of been able to have a pool to swim in as we had expected with the room rates we had paid for...I also was disspointed with the breakfast service ie. serving hot oatmeal without a sm. side of milk & also brought it out to me with a teaspoon, very difficult to enjoy/consume, finally was able to get the girls attention to get these two things...rest of my family had finished their breakfast by then, & left the table as this took so long...need to be staffed/prepared with breakfast on a long w/e...Also should have/build in another hottub, for the no. of guests/rooms as I/we weren't able to get in it the whole weekend...don't know how clean it was anyways..."
POSITIVE,Was just hoping for a decent hotel to stay in for the night and turned out to be very much impressed with every part of the hotel...from the lobby to the rooms. Very nice.
POSITIVE,"Liked it much I stay at the Primrose Hotel in Toronto and had good time in there. The peoples who are there are very good and happy. My room on 2012 was a nice room with 2 beds for us. The room was cleaned, and the size was big for luggage. I like the hotel and hope that I can go back again to stay and see more of the sights in the city."
POSITIVE,"Stayed one night, Friday, August 5, 2011. Room was nice enough although a little dark & crowded by too much dark wood furniture. Everything was SPOTLESSLY clean. Four pillows on each of our queen size beds covered in brilliantly white bed linens. The air conditioner worked very well even though the thermostat did look 50 years old. The room had every amentity we needed. Not very impressed with the lack of counter space in the small bathroom and not really a fan of having the hair dryer outside of the bathroom setup but it worked. Plenty of large fluffy towels, a great shower curtain and a water pic shower head completed the small bathroom. Pool and jacuzzi are large, clean and well kept. A sign in the pool area notes that every evening from 10 to 11 p.m. is adult only ""relax and unwind"" time. Very nice! Hallways do have many great pictures of vintage automobiles to help complete the ambience. Check in was smooth and speedy, complete with a peanut butter cookie and a smile :). Continental breakfast would be nice but we did have a reasonably priced, decent, hot breakfast in O'Henry where the service was friendly and efficient. A few things to note. Enterprise Drive is difficult to get to, in fact coming from US75 and trying to turn left onton Enterprise is impossible, as Enterprise is a single lane coming from that direction. If you are coming from the opposite direction, from Greenfield Village or Rt. 94 there will be no problem. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good, clean, reasonably priced accomodations. I will stay again if I am in the area. Oh yeah I forgot...It IS PINK!"
POSITIVE,We were on our way to Michigans upper peninsula and on our way decided to spend a day in Frankenmuth. Spent the night at this Best Western. My wife liked all the flowers in bloom on the exterior. The room was clean and they had an adequate complimentary breakfast. If I come to this area again I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"I joined five friends on a trip to Yosemite. We drove from Seattle so needed a place about half way to spend one night. Some had never been to the Ashland Shakespeare Festival so we included an evening at the theatre as well. The Bard's Inn was one I picked off the internet because it was walking distance to the theatre and to downtown Ashland, where we had reservations for dinner. The Inn was easy to find, very attractive and comfortable. The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious and featured more choices than most of us expected. The staff members were most helpful in making contact with a friend who was to meet us there when we were delayed on our trip to Ashland. Great place to end a long drive!"
POSITIVE,"I had to take the lamp shades out on the balcony to dust, looked like that had not been done in a long while. I ran a clean damp cloth over all the furniture as it was all dusty. The bathroom was not as clean as I would have wished.Pros: Location and breakfast were great. Cons: It did not meet my expectations in cleanliness."
POSITIVE,"Clean rooms, reasonable rate. Good place to start and end they days activities."
NEUTRAL,"Would stay there again. Although its old, and could use some updating, the front desk was nice and quick, the room was clean, and it was good for the price. Would recommend!"
POSITIVE,"Nice room and great customer service! A little of the main freeway, but worth driving a few miles. We would stay there again. Pros: Great customer service!"
POSITIVE,"Clean room, and friendly staff. The only issue was there is not enough parking...you have to park on the street if you get in later in the day."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here mainly for the ability to leave our car for a weeklong vacation. The hotel is fair, and not the kind youâd stay at for more than one day. But the parking was well-lit and safe and the shuttle drivers were kind and punctual. Iâd recommend if all you want is a bed and a place to park your car. Room Tip: ask to not be so far from lobby! We walked forever!"
POSITIVE,"In for a conference great basic rooms - wish they'd do away with the resort fee and bundle it in with the price, very annoying. decent biz center and wifi connection."
POSITIVE,Lage
POSITIVE,I stayed here during a business trip. It was a good hotel. I ate at the restaurant and it was very good. It was well kept and the staff was friendly. The only complaint I had was the shuttle took a long time to pick me up at the airport. I ended up taking a cab since I was on a tight timeframe.
POSITIVE,"I've stayed in different hotels in Vegas and so far this was one of my favorites. There's a nice food court with a good variety, coffee maker in the room, tub in the room, and close to CVS. The pool looked really nice but I didn't have a chance to use it. I liked that the hotel was on the smaller side so less walking to things inside the hotel. Easy check in even easier check out. Staff was very nice. I would definately stay again. Location: Location was great. Has a tram to city center/Bellagio.If you walk a little ways to excalibur they have a tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay."
NEGATIVE,":ur family travels a lot so we stay in several hotels a year. We try to stay with the bigger chains because we feel that we will hve a better stay. Overall this is a great hotel and we enjoyed our trip to flordia. But we had several issues that were not resolved to our satisfaction durring our stay. First the good: Staff was very nice, and polite. Maids were amazing and we enjoyed all of their advice on places we could see wildlife, and fun stuff we can do with our kids. The hotel overall was very nice. They had a parking structure under the hotel for our car with a easy acess to the elevators so unloading and loading luggage was easy. The room wasnice aswell. Large bathroom, nice kitchen and living area, amazing views from the balcony..and a seperate bedroom for the adults. The views and location were breath taking! Pool was not bad either. Now or the bad. First night room smelled very musty. Woke up the next morning and the floor was soaked. Spoke to the front desk. They sent maintnence up and they opened the closet and it smelled like a dead body was in there. They cleaned the ac filter, soaked up some of the water but the shop vac just flooded the room with the nasty smell. The maintnence guy couldn't take it and took the shop vac out without finishing. They put a fan in which stayedthere untill late when we called to have it removed. The smell mde me soo sick and I ended up having a very bad allergy attack. Went to the beach to get fresh air and when we returned the smell was everywhere. We ended up going to the store multiple times to get diffrent air fresheners. The whole stay the floor was still soaked. Maintnence never returned. A lot of stuff got soaked, several items ruined. Everytime e tried to speak to the front desk they basically blew us off. We even had issues with the seats on the balcony. I sat in 1 that was cracked and got the back of my bum pinched pretty bad....ever swim in the ocean with a Cut...not a good feeling and also not a good idea with it being shark bite capital of the world! (Maintnence did replace the chair). Also the door to the balcony was very loose almost got locked out, and they include dishes for 4 but the room is for up to 6....I don't understand that. The hotel did knock 26.00 a night off our stay and give us a few bucks in quarters to wash a few things that got wet, but I truely think they should have done more...moving us was not an option at first as they were booked, but they offered later. Instead we left several days before we were suposed to. I just couldn't handle the smell or the soaked floor any longer!"
POSITIVE,Our recent stay at the Wingate by Wyndham proved to be a good choice for our anniversary vacation to Lake George. Not only was the place meticulously clean but the staff was more than helpful in making us feel comfortable. All seemed to take great pride in the appearance of the hotel and its service. The indoor and outdoor pool proved to be an asset for a refreshing swim before relaxing in the whirlpool each evening after dinner. The complimentary breakfast buffet was a good way to begin the day. Prior to traveling to Lake George we had never stayed at a Wingate by Wyndham hotel. We will certainly look for the chain when visiting other locations. Room Tip: Reservations were booked through Orbitz but we had no problem when contacting the hotel directly to...
POSITIVE,"Our room was really big. Very clean and nice, however the hotel itself was a bit dated. For the area, this hotel was very adequate. We had a problem with no heat but we we were moved right away upon our request to an equally large room."
POSITIVE,Pros: The convenient shuttle to the airport. Cons: The internet was not working in the room..
POSITIVE,"My family and I stayed here while passing through. I had read the reviews online and am pleased to say that I agree. The hotel was clean, safe and in a great location for our trip. For the price and amenities, it really can't be beat. We travel through this area on our way to visit family and will be sure to stop again. The kids want me to mention that McDonald's was right next door and the pool was small, but great! :)"
POSITIVE,"Everything about this hotel was a very nice expierence for my first trip to Vegas. The one and only thing I didnt care for was if there was a question needed to be made to the front desk there was a recording from your room phone to the front desk, that ultimately never got answered. Then when we went down to the front desk, we had to wait in line with people that were just checking in. And the room walls were a bit thin but not horrible. Other than that it was nice and pleasurable expierence. The staff was very friendly and pleasant to deal with. The Hotel is very clean and centraly located on the strip with easy access by tram to other hotels. And was resonably priced! Room Tip: Make sure to ask for a room above at least the 15th floor. Noise off the strip seems like it would b..."
POSITIVE,"Spent 3 nights at Monte Carlo in December for a quick gambling binge, and got a pretty good rate through MGM. Check in was smooth - there were no lines and I was in my room within 10 minutes of arriving at the property. It looked like most of the room had seen some upgrades in the past couple years - bed and bedding was decent quality, carpet looked clean and the there was a flat screen TV. The one area that looked like it was ignored as part of the renovations was the bathroom, which was somewhat dark and still had awful fluorescent lights. Shower pressure was good, however. The one problem I had with my room was the air conditioning - very stuffy and warm when I checked in, and even with the thermostat down at 65 it really did not get very cold. Guess this is their incentive to get people down into the casino! Soundproofing was also pretty poor - could hear my neighbors when they inserted the key in the door, and could also hear some muted talking. I did not have a big problem with the resort fee, as I typically use the internet and fitness facility when I travel and it is nice not to have to pay for everything in separate steps. I do think $15 is a little high given what most people pay for the room and the quality of the equipment in the fitness center, and think $10 might be more appropriate. Did eat a couple of times at Monte Carlo, and my favorite casual restaurant at the facility remains the Pub. But then again I am a sports junkie and like to try new beers, so I have a natural bias. Service was efficient and good everywhere I went, unlike some of my past experiences at Mandalay Bay and the Bellagio Cafe. Unfortunately I did not win on this trip, but found the dealers very friendly at the property. The main reason I stayed at the property was its location - it has great access to Aria and Bellagio via the tram, and is within walking distance to several other properties as well. I generally stay at Bellagio but was visiting with a couple friends on tighter budgets, and it was very easy to slip over to the property via the tram. Also within walking distance of both Walgreens and the ABC Store to pick up provisional water and snacks at reasonable prices. Overall it was a good stay, and I would recommend the property if you can get it at a reasonable rate! Room Tip: Upper floor rooms away from the elevators are pretty quiet."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, July 18-22, 2011. I enjoyed the spacious, clean, quiet room overlooking the Strip. I was surprised how spacious the rooms were and the quality furnishings, comfortable beds, etc. This hotel has a dignified modern atmosphere that is perfect for me! I have stayed at this hotel twice before (2001, 2008) and I would gladly return for another vacation. Best of all, the rates are very economical if rooms are reserved early!"
POSITIVE,We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July 2011. It is conveniently located right off Highway 405 so we could hop onto the highway to get anywhere we needed to go.Luckily we were upgraded to an executive suite when we checked in so we had a large room for the 4 of us. We stayed in the building near the pool and tennis courts. The pool is magnificent with beautiful furniture and plently of towels. In teh morning we woudl drive over to San Vicente Boulevard which is a 5-10 minute drive away where there are plenty of cafes and restaurnats for breakfast. We really enjoyed our stay in LA.
POSITIVE,The staff was very helpful and friendly. Service was excellent and couldn't do enough for me to make my stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. Very clean. The only complaint I have is that the internet was very slow and at times no service at all. The Internet was very slow and sometimes no service at all.
POSITIVE,"I LOVE THE MONTE CARLO... I HAVE STAYED THERE BEFORE..A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE STAFF THIS TIME.. CHECK IN GIRL WAS GREAT. BUT OVER ALL I FOUND SOME OF THE STAFF WERE NOT AS FRIENDLY AS USUAL.. DRINK PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEM TOO HAPPY.. I ALWAYS TIP EVERYONE, AND THEY JUST WERE NOT THE SAME AS MY STAY BEFORE.. I DID HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF THE FLOOR STAFF AND I WISH I HAD TAKEN DOWN THEIR NAME.. I TOOK MY 84 YEAR OLD MOTHER.. AND SHE GOT TURNED AROUND FROM WHERE I SAID I WOULD BE PLAYING A MACHINE AND SHE WAS LOST.. THIS GENTLEMAN TOOK GREAT PAINS IN HELPING HER FIND ME.. AND I WAS VERY GREATFULL. I WAS WANDERING AROUND LOOKING FOR HER AND SHE HAD BEEN DOING THE SAME.. I WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK AGAIN... Pros: CLEAN AND EYE PLEASING Cons: NOT ENOUGH BATHROOMS ON CASINO LEVEL Location: LOCATION IS PERFECT.. MIDDLE OF THE STRIP"
POSITIVE,its good
POSITIVE,"This is a luxurious hotel without the high costs. The Monte Carlo has great proximity to many attractions on the Strip. The pool setup is awesome as there is a Lazy River, Wave Pool, and Traditional Pool where you may cool down. If shopping is your thing, the City Center is a short walk next door or you can take the complimentary tram that leaves right from the Monte Carlo."
NEGATIVE,Was not happy with the room felt I waste my money.
POSITIVE,The hot breakfast was amazing...so nice to be able to stay right there and get a full course breakfast as opposed to going out for breakfast.
POSITIVE,Great view from our room. Too bad there isn't really beach access right in front of the hotel though. Overall it was a good deal for an ocean view room. If they allowed pets we would be staying there more often. Had to leave the dog at home this time.
NEGATIVE,"Having read the reviews, I was really hopeful that this would be a nice stop along the way from Arizona to Canada. Unfortunately our experience was not that good. When we arrived the front desk clerk was friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and spacious. The TV was fairly old and had quite alot of static on the channels. We could hear people coming and going through the night and early morning from our room. Our door lock would stick and we had a hard time opening our door. We tried to use the hot tub and pool in the evening, however the hot tub seemed broken. The water was lukewarm at best and not worth sitting in. The jets seemed to broken as well and they would spout water into the air instead of the pool. The pool, of course, was freezing as it wasn't heated. There were no towels, as indicated, and the change rooms/washrooms were dirty and not well kept. It wasn't a big deal to run across the parking lot to our room from the pool, but it was pretty annoying standing out there, soaking wet and freezing cold trying to get into our room because the door lock would stick. Although the night was a bit noisy, we did sleep. The bed was fairly comfortable. We were really looking forward to the breakfast after all the reviews. Unfortunately this was probably the worst part of our expereince. We were at the breakfast room well before the the breakfast ended (over 45 minutes). When we walked in the tables that weren't full of people, which was about a 1/4 of them, were full of dirty dishes and money for tip. There were literally 10 tables that had dirty dishes on them. There were no open tables that were clean. We sat at an empty table, adorned with our very own set of dirty dishes and money, and waited. The 'waitress' saw us walk in through the window in the kitchen door and even made eye contact with me. She watched us sit down and then we heard her start complaining to the cook about more people coming in. She then came out and talked to another table, completely ignoring us. We waited 10 minutes for her to come over. When she finally did come over (after aruging with a young family at a close table about whether they could even be served because of what time is was and that they closed at 9:30. When it was finally established that they could have breakfast, but only if they all ordered one specific thing on the menu). She then came over to us, told us our breakfast would take about 15 minutes, that they were 'slammed' that morning, almost out of dishes (perhaps if they washed all the dirty ones they wouldn't be??), and that the large table at the back of the room was taking up all the food and dishes and putting the kitchen totally behind. She then told us she would be back to get our drink order. She didn't clear the money or the dirty dishes off our table. She went back to the kitchen to complain to the cook (and yes, we could hear her). We waited another 10 minutes and she never returned. Despite coming out of the kitchen to deliver food to the large table at the back, and to lock the door to the breakfast room 15 minutes before the breakfast was supposed to end. When she went back into the kitchen for a third time, still making no attempt to take our order or clear our table (we called her over but she ignored us), we left. We went to McDonald's across the street. When I went to check out, the front desk clerk (who was different than the night before), took a personal call and proceeded to have an arguement with whomever was on the other end of the line, sounded like her child, while I waited to get my reciept. We will not stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Clean, conveniently located from highway, felt safe."
POSITIVE,The desk clerks were wonderful. Margaret and Paul are a great team! They were both very helpful and informative. We are happy to have met them. We will definetly stay at your location again in the near future. Please be sure that they are given our thanks and appreciation for their service.
POSITIVE,"The full breakfast offered daily. Nothing Location was easy to find and near other eating establishments. We extended our stay due to a sudden snow storm, we would not have done this if our experience had been unfavorable. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and confortable. We will stay here in the future if the need arises."
POSITIVE,"Hotel located in quiet and nice small town. Hotel built amid orange groves but within short distance from town and restaurants. Good free breakfast, very clean rooms and beds super comfortable. All looks like new even though built about 10 yearsago. Our destination was Sequoia and found it took about 45 min to get there due to some very winding roads. Staff very friendly and helpful.I would recommend this hotel highly"
POSITIVE,Nice clean rooms and very helpful staff
POSITIVE,"Very clean and really had everything you would need for a three day stay near Ft Leonard Wood. We had three rooms for family to see my son graduate. Close to the base (3 miles?), walk to the gas station store and a restaurant. Great daily breakfast in the lobby. Also had a nice outside pool."
NEUTRAL,"It was a nice hotel, the shuttle was quick and there was a good Mexican restaurant in the same parking lot."
POSITIVE,"Greeted with a friendly smile, room was excellent, and they know how to make a guest feel at home."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean and staff were friendly. There was the very small bathroom with the unusual door, perhaps a pocket door would work better for that set up. One other small thing, the television produced a hum if the volume was put too high. Otherwise, I rate my stay a 4 out of 5."
POSITIVE,We stayed here last week with a school field trip. The room was clean and the breakfast was great. I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Hotel conveniently located right off 46/101. Room very clean. Liked small things such as sanitized TV remote, coffee machine, furniture. HVAC unit is set at 78 deg. Sufficient for heat of day. Rear of room gets hot but installed ceiling fan takes care of air distribution. Coffee shop is very expensive. $18.50 was too much for 1 egg, bacon, toast, and [?] fruit."
POSITIVE,"We wanted a room with two comfortable chairs as shown in Expedia pictures of this motel. The motel has been redecorated and two chairs was not available in a standard king room. The General Manager upgraded us to a deluxe room, free of charge, with a separate living area with a couch. It was very nice and we could not have ask for a nicer staff. This motel is a good deal for the money. Pros: Nice separate living area in the deluxe king room. Cons: It was fine. Location: Near the mall and nice resturants."
NEGATIVE,TV had a loud squealing noise. Bed was unstable and squeaked every move that you would make. Room was dirty - plastic bags and garbage on the floor. Room needed a make over. Seemed like we were in the 70's or something. Desk clerk was very friendly tho.
POSITIVE,"Combination of value service and location has kept me returning. High speed internet. Friendly staff. Rooms could use some updates but neat and tidy. Liked: Rooms, Location, Value, Unlimited high speed internet. Pool."
POSITIVE,great hotel with added benefits!
POSITIVE,"I have stayed frequently at this hotel. The room is comfortable and staff is friendly. Unlike most hotels that you can hear individual's in the next room, the rooms are very quiet."
NEGATIVE,"This property could use some modernization. Our room was drab and dated. The noisy heater ran continuously, never cycling at the temperature entered. So we turned it off and on manually. The on site restaurant served good home style food at a reasonable price. There was no complimentary breakfast. Upon arrival I inquired about a certain attraction and was told that it was open. It was closed for the season."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here one night to attend local event. Staff friendly, rooms clean. Even accommodated our dog on short notice. They give guest voucher for breakfast at Denny's in parking lot. Rooms weren't huge but enough to manage 3 guest and dog. Fresh decor."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here towards the end of our cross country move. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Lobby area was actually warm and inviting and had many people relaxing and hanging out but in a nice way. Food nearby and plenty of delivery options. Room was clean, cool, and bug free. Would stay here again if in the area."
NEUTRAL,The rooms are nice but the management are rude. No ice machines or vending on third floor. No tv guide or channel viewer. The parking is not convienent. The motel is just no up to best western standards.
POSITIVE,The front desk person was very nice & the room was clean.
POSITIVE,"The hotel has nice amentities, particularly for the price. Room incls a sm refrig, microwave, coffee maker, nice makeup mirror etc. The decor (indoor and out) was nice as well and they offer a great complimentary breakfast- eggs, sausage, the whole nine yards. Room was clean. Location is fairly good- near the beach but not within walking distance of restaurants etc. Other problem- you can hear the train. Windows are double pane so the noise isn't awful but is audible. Train does stop after 11 PM. I would recommend, esp if you aren't too early to bed."
POSITIVE,"Staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. Location was absolutely fantastic, close to the ""gaslamp"" district and Horton Plaza, shops and restaurants galore. Seaport Village, Convention Center and harbor were all easy walks. Best of all, we had parking for our motorcycles right outside our door, a neighborhood market across the street for beer, wine and snacks....no complaints and will stay there again. Great price value for downtown San Diego."
POSITIVE,We really enjoyed our stay at this Best Western. My husband was checked in by a very friendly lady. The room was clean and comfortable. We travel a lot and have stayed in a lot of hotel rooms. We would recommend this hotel!
POSITIVE,"What a pleasant surprise! Our family of four decided to spend a couple of nights in Cottonwood and found a great rate at this hotel/motel. The pictures were nice but I was still nervous. I typically stay in hotel lines nicer than this. My fears were quickly dispelled soon after arriving. The front desk employees were wonderful. They were friendly and accommodating. Based on our conversation they overheard, they provided some pamphlets for Out of Africa and the Verde Canyon Railway trip. I was excited to hear the hotel will give you a 10% discount on the railway tickets if you buy it through them. Good deal. Our room was a two queen room and really nice. The decor was very modern, nicely tiled in the bathroom and a plasma TV. There was a small table with two comfortable, upholstered dining chairs. We also had a fridge in the room. Also free wi-fi. Breakfast was a step above continental with eggs, sausage and waffles (in addition to continental items). There is a mexican restaurant in the same parking lot (Plaza Bonita) that was always packed. We will have to try it out when we come back. There is also a chinese buffet on the other side of the intersection that was good, too. The hotel was about 5-10 minutes drive from old town. Again, this place was well worth the rates and excellent customer service. Very, very happy."
POSITIVE,I stayed for two nights and arrived late. The check-in staff was very chatty and made me feel very welcome. The rooms where OK and the brecky was a nice continental one. The staff was very helpful in giving directions to local attractions
POSITIVE,"very thankful that they allowed us early check-in; my son works nights, we flew early and he needed his sleep; very accommodating staff; comfortable beds, good black-out drapes; functioning and accessible bedside lamps we had to leave too early and missed breakfast"
POSITIVE,"To be honest I can't believe some of the other reviews that have been posted. The room was very nice. The staff was VERY PLEASANT. You could tell they were trained to provided the best customer service possible. They always had a smile on their face, and you knew that they would do anything to make your stay pleasant. The room was wonderful. The beds were very comfortable, and well the HUGE HD TV was just the icing on the cake. We will definately visit the East Texas area, and the Best Western of Marshall will definately be the place we stay."
POSITIVE,Wonderful experience. I hope to bring my daughters and their children here next summer. Everything was wonderful. Would not ask you to change anything!
POSITIVE,"The staff was very friendly. Each room has a dvd player and in the lobby there's a good choice of movies to watch for free. The breakfast has a lot of options - waffles, cereals (not junky sugary) along with bacon eggs, bagels. Enough to get thru lunch easily. The pool is nice, but too cold to use this time. There's not a lot to do in Indio, but everything in palm springs is very close."
POSITIVE,Great hotel for the money.
POSITIVE,"All that we expected was a comfortable place to sleep, but we got more than that. Had we wanted, the indoor pool was available to us for a bit of swimming and relaxing before bed. And that king sized bed was very comfortable with room for both of us to stretch out in it. We had a good number of TV channels to choose from and the picture was very clear on the room's TV. In the morning, the shower was great as there was plenty of water pressure and the shower would have been useful for a person well over six feet tall. The breakfast served at the Raintree was exceptional. One did not have to make anything as all items including cheese omelettes were cooked and ready to go. The coffee was good as well as the juice, so the Raintree Motor Inn gave one no excuse for checking out hungry. The staff was very helpful at checkout explaining how to get to where we were going, so we got there without any difficulty. If we are ever staying a night in Ada, OK again, we will go back to this Best Western motel."
NEUTRAL,Perfect hotel Location coud be better.
NEUTRAL,"The room was clean and comfortable with great conveniences, such as a fridge. This hotel was fine but at time the surrounding area was very noisy. Heard people come up and down the stairs and the roar of engines constantly going down the highway at night. Lack sound proof rooms. The breakfast was fine. Front desk service was very laid back."
NEGATIVE,We have stayed at this hotel before and were quite happy on our prior visit-- this time we had a major customer service slip up by the employees due to a lack of communication on their part. Upon check out I requested the manager/owner call me to have a conversation. I have yet to receive a phone call so I can't say I could recommend a stay here until I feel that my business was appreciated enough to call me back at my request.
POSITIVE,"Michelle the night desk person was awesome! The room was very clean. It had a nice view of the mountains in the distance on the main side. The breakfast was nice and hot and had a nice variety of items. I will stay here again and highly recommend this place for a good nights sleep. We originally were booked to stay at the Red Roof across the street. Couldn't stay there because it was to dark and the lobby bathrooms were out of order so we figured it wasn't a good idea. I totally recommend staying here for the price. It was about $72 tax included, nice clean room and a good hot breakfast!"
POSITIVE,"We chose this hotel through the Biltmore's weekend package. We had read some of the reviews and overall people were pleased with their stay. My father, who is an airline pilot and has stayed here on several occasions, highly recommended it. It fit perfectly within our budget, so between the reviews and our price point, this seemed the best choice. The staff have been so kind, warm, and attentive. We have seen nothing but smiles since we've been here. The location is perfect and I recommend requesting a room with the mountain view. We are within walking distance of several restaurants and close driving distance to downtown and the Biltmore. The room was very clean and my only complaint would be that the duvet and cover on the bed kept sliding off while we slept. Had it been very cold, I would have frozen, but the room was temperate so I only woke up a couple times to pull the comforter off the floor. And since I have noticed that the manager is excellent with reading and corresponding to these posts, I'm sure this minor problem will be remedied soon so please don't let it deter you from a wonderful and relaxing stay here. Enjoy!"
NEUTRAL,"The ceiling was very poorly sound insulated. You could hear every step the people upstairs took -- back and forth, back and forth.... The air conditioner was adequately cold, but very noisy and went on and off frequently. There was a coffeemaker but no coffee. Called the office and they said they would have a maid bring it down -- 3 hours later at 9am when they got to work. Also, wireless didn't work, but they had a public computer in lobby. Breakfast was great with eggs, sausage, french toast, great coffee. The room was clean and well furnished. Four pillows and nice linens. Bath clean and carpet in good shape. I would definitely stay here again but only upstairs!"
POSITIVE,If you like old vintage/antiques then you will love this hotel. I think most of the furniture in all of the lounges are replicas but they are very fun to look at. The rooms were simple but clean. Very neat hotel
POSITIVE,"our stay at this hotel was superb.comfortable ,user friendly rooms.the staff was excellent and the breakfast was great.the food was delicious and fresh.i would stay at this hotel anytime i was in this vicinity again.they really make you feel at home. thank you .best western staff"
POSITIVE,Everything was clean and the staff was friendly. We'd stay there again.
POSITIVE,"Our room was modern, clean and well maintained. The location was not the greatest...very close to a truck stop and far from any decent restaurants. The only restaurant close by was a grungy Denny's, which in my opinion has really gone downhill. Also didn't like that there wasn't a vending machine selling soft drinks (as was stated in the hotel's information binder) but had to obtain them from the front desk."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has a friendly and efficient staff. The hotel is located by a beautiful park and Charlotte Harbor with wonderful views of both. The pool looks outt to the harbor and is nicer than in the brochure. Also there is great shopping and eating nearby. Although the furnishings are dated, we would definitely go back."
POSITIVE,We rented two rooms at this hotel. One room with 3 queen size beds and one with 2 queen size beds. They were roomy and clean. The pool was wonderful! Clean and warm. The hot tub was very nice too. The breakfast had a great variety and was good. I would definitely stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Clean, staff friendly, fantastic breakfast, beautiful views, overall a wonderful place to stay."
POSITIVE,"Really happy with this hotel choice... despite there not being many choices in the area. The room was great.. clean and updated. The staff was really nice and the breakfast was fresh and delicious. The restaurant next door (trailriders) has good food and a really nice bar, and good beer. Overall... if you're going skiing/boarding at the nearby resort... [?] this is a great place to stay."
POSITIVE,"After searching various websites for a place for my partner and me to stay in Monterey, we decided on the Best Western De Anza based on location, traveler comments and pricing. It was a great choice! This is a beautiful small upscale motel, with comfortable rooms, very friendly and responsive staff, and easy access and parking. First, the hotel itself. It is on a motel strip, but the area seems safe and walkable. If our king-bed room is typical, the rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated, in a traditional and homey style. The bathroom was clean and nicely appointed with granite vanity, lots of good clean towels, a good tub/shower, and really nice soaps and shampoo. The king bed was extremely comfortable with a mattress pad that added softness and support. Lots of good pillows too. Our room was an upstairs corner room with a big dormer window and another large window on the adjacent wall. Both windows opened, a necessity since the room did not have A/C. There was a large, quiet ceiling fan. And, oh yes, the room provided a microwave, refrigerator and safe. The TV, however, was an older 24"" CRT, with a perfectly good picture and remote. The continental breakfast was limited, but good. Cereals, breads, muffins, bagels, instant oatmeal, fruit (available throughout the day), milk (whole & 2%) coffee, tea, orange and apple juice. A good toaster and a microwave. There are just 3 small tables in the lobby/breakfast area, plus two armchairs and a couch. But trays are provided to take food to your room. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings. Staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. One of the young men could have been a concierge. As a reference librarian, I admired his information skills. The BW De Anza is a couple of miles from the Aquarium and Cannery Row, and a bit closer to Fisherman's Wharf. We combined driving, walking and using the Waterfront Area Visitors Express (WAVE) trolley that runs frequently among the coastal areas. We would happily stay at this lovely facility again. It was a very good experience. Room Tip: We liked our second floor corner room (212). There's another one on the 3rd floor. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"On the beach, plenty of restaurants around, good walking atmosphere. Night staff helpful for restaurant ideas. Temperature outside was cooler but had a hard time cooling off the room"
POSITIVE,We live in eastern Shelby County and we attend numerous events in downtown and midtown Memphis. At the end of the evening it just makes sense to make a short trip to the Hotel rather than a half hour trip home after a night of entertainment. We don't Drink and Drive so we do the smart thing and stay at the Gen-X Inn!
POSITIVE,"This hotel was priced right for the room. It was very convenient to all the surrounding activities. It didn't have a fitness center onsite, but offered complimentary access to the fitness center across the street, which was a great fitness center. The breakfast offered was not the best, but by far not the worse I have had either. The coffee was fabulous (and I'm picky). The room was very spacious and clean. The jacuzzi tub was nice, as was the fireplace. The bed was comfortable and we didn't have any problems with outside noise. The decor of the hotel was very welcoming and made you feel like you were in a ""ski"" town. We travel to Jackson for business quite a bit and this will for sure be our first choice for hotels."
POSITIVE,"My family and I spent a night here and we thought it was awesome !!! The staff were so friendly and helpful. There was so much to do at the hotel we didn't want to leave to go do anything else lol. Between the pool, the hot tub, the gym we definitely kept busy. The beds were so comfortable,, the shower is a rain shower which is awesome and everything was very clean. There was also a free hot breakfast in the morning which had a lot of variety, there was even a lot of food choices for my husband who is diabetic. The location is awesome it's close to the mall and the movie theatre etc... and it was nice and quiet, you wouldn't even know there were other people in the hotel. This was our families first stay at a best western hotel but it definitely won't be our last !!!!!"
POSITIVE,"Great Service, Clean, Great location, Very presentable."
POSITIVE,"The Best Western in Victoria is new and very nice. The rooms were decorated nicely and the bathrooms had granite countertops. Everything was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. You will not be disappointed if you stay at this hotel. If you are coming to Victoria, stay at the Best Western. Whenever && wherever we travel we always stay or try to stay at a Best Western. Stayed Sept. 2011, traveled on business"
POSITIVE,"Probably the cleanest hotel I have ever visited in my life, they have taken care of every little detail, other hotel managers should visit this hotel to learn what to do to run a first class operation"
POSITIVE,"My wife and two kids had a king-bed / kitchen room for the annual Prosser Balloon Rally weekend. The room was spacious and clean, and the location is tough to beat for the balloon rally. You're a long walk / short drive from the tiny Prosser airport where the launch the balloons. The hotel has a small indoor pool that the kids loved.If wine brings you to Prosser, the hotel is also very close to the wineries of Vintner's Village. It's not the most scenic location: You're right off the interstate amid fast-food restaurants and gas stations, and you're a ways from Prosser's quaint downtown. But all in all a solid hotel and I'd return again."
NEGATIVE,"Shuttle service Breakfast was a complete rip-off at c$9.95 Pp, plus we where charged for coffee at c$2 a cup and c$4 for a small glass of juice, all in a crappy atmosphere with an overbearing ""manager"" (prices all before tax) Walls very thin - could hear ""EVERYTHING"" from neighbors who had a small baby. Windows could not open, stuffy aircon gave wife sinus attack - great!"
POSITIVE,Well staffed with friendly people. VERY close to Assateague Island.
NEUTRAL,It was just ok... The best part was that it was close to freeways so u could hop in and go to San Diego on 20 min... The breakfast was ok... Good enough . And cleanliness wise I didn't have to shower in flip flops... I did think for the quality it was overpriced.
NEUTRAL,"The Best Western Plus Kamloops is a nice hotel that's very clean. The rooms were spacious and modern. Breakfast was included in the price - and was quite good with a decent selection of bread/bagels, toaster, cereal, yogurt, coffee, tea, juice, and eggs and bacon. The coffee maker in my room did not work, which was probably more disappointing since there is no restaurant on site! For a BW Plus, I thought this was a major 'minus.' I don't travel in Kamloops often but I got a sense that the hotel was along a 'strip' where there were other hotels. And that was the rationale for not having a restaurant/lounge...as it is within walking distance to other selections of restaurants etc. Which may be true...and in the summer that'd be fine. But i visited in January. luckily no snow, but it was rather chilly! The nearest resturant was a few blocks walk. we did it and survived...but it would've been nice to have an on site place to have a drink after a long day."
POSITIVE,"Great place - quiet, right on the gorgeous beach and walk to long, scenic pier. Restaurants and shops very close by. Juice and coffee 24 hours, great donuts in AM!"
POSITIVE,"Check in and out were the fastest I've ever had, even at much more expensive hotels. Perfect! The wifi was quick and easy to use. Breakfast was a good selection but not good quality. We were traveling to Louisville daily for a convention and thestaff gave us easy to follow directions. They were friendly and knowledgeable. It was great for the money, compared to what else is available in the area."
NEUTRAL,The room was clean. The food at the restaurant was not very good.
POSITIVE,"Good continental breakfast selections. My sons enjoyed the indoor pool. I enjoyed the treadmill. We had no mini fridge or microwave. We really could have used those items because we stayed for 3 nights. Most motels have them now. The front desk staff was not very friendly to my sons ages 12, 11 and 9."
NEGATIVE,"The pool area was ""old school"", but lots of natural light and gigantic. Sadly the kind staff at the front desk cannot make up for the Horrific beds. Not only are they only doubles (at best) they are also OLD mattresses and the pillows are junk. Free omelets at breakfast do not make up for a lost night sleep from bad beds folks! We went to a marriot on the other side of town for the second night...the beds were AMAZING (pool area was somewhat lacking, but hey I slept GREAT), great pillows and the room was $30.00 less. Room Tip: Ask to be on the pool level, but NOT on the side of the atrium by the ping pong tables...LOUD! Also, there were hockey kids running around the 2nd floor and it sounded like a boston marathon:("
POSITIVE,"From I-95 located off exit 94 in Savannah, GA, this hotel is very pet friendly with a nominal fee of $10 each pet, no size limit on dogs and ground floor rooms available. Thereâs plenty of grassy area to exercise pets. Staff was very welcoming, thereâs a Dennyâs inside the hotel, a Cracker Barrel down the street and some fast food places in between. Though the hotel is on the older side we had no complaints with our stay. We found this hotel through www.petswelcome.com"
POSITIVE,The exterior is a little run down but our room was nice and large. Very nice renovations in the washroom. I found it strange that all 4 pillows on the bed were different but this is a minor detail. To get to downtown Jasper you will need to drive but its a short drive as the city isn't too large. I would recommend this hotel.
NEUTRAL,"The room was adequate, but would recommend staying in Ruidoso, NM if possible. Stayed in Alamagordo because of lack of rooms in Cloudcroft, not realizing Ruidoso would have been much more convenient. Would not recommend using Orbitz, since motel price direct would have been 20% less - plus I don't know who Orbitz pays the taxes and fees to that the hotel did not collect."
NEUTRAL,"Fairly clean hotel. Previous reviews about the breakfast were correct. The eggs are not good. The sausages are pre-cooked. Poor fruit choices (apples, and canned peaches). The hotel is full of large groups all the time I believe (we were one of them). The Waffles looked good, but I don't eat them. The toaster kept popping the circuit breaker. Beds were not the best quality. Room Tip: Top floor so no one is making noise above you."
POSITIVE,"Polite, friendly staff"
NEGATIVE,"Whenever we are going to South Lake Tahoe we usually stay at this hotel and overall was ok but last time, I'm sorry but I'm not planning to stay there anymore! We had a ants all over the place, they were everywhere, I even found them in the bed. I couldn't sleep that night at all because of that. In the morning I went to the lobby and complaint and the lady up front didn't do anything, she didn't even say sorry or anything but instead she charged us over a $200 for a night. After that I said that I'm not going to stay there anymore, I rather pay that much money to other hotels that won't have ants everywhere. Very bad experience!"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I visited here in July 2011 and for the price we were very suprised at the quality of this place. The Hotel looked like it was recently either renovated or remodeled it was very modern. The front desk staff was great and very helpful with local eateries in queens when we wanted to stay near hotel. The Rooms were great , clean and very comfortable (especialy the bed) The area is very multi cultured so for teh one or two crazies you see a hand full of working class so we werent to worried. The train is about a block away so that was very convenient. Overall i would definatly stay here again.."
POSITIVE,"I have read many reviewes with this hotel. I started staying in Morton approx. 2 years ago. The hotel has had many major updates to renovate and update. The rooms are large and clean, staff is friendly, and resturant food is good and resonably priced. Breakfast is typical of a free continental breakfast. Some reviews complained about the morning meal, however, with the great room rate, I can live without a four course meal for breakfast. In todays economy you don't always get what you want for no pay. Excellent place - Will stay again Note - I have never used pool or hot tub - looks fine, never used it. Pros: attached resturant for a resonably price hotel Location: good location with many resturants, and convienences nearby"
NEUTRAL,"It wasn't the best hotel. It wasn't worth the price, it had smoking, and there were people outside yelling at 11. The continental breakfast was good and it was based on a courtyard with a decent pool. Room Tip: Good Breakfast See more room tips"
NEUTRAL,I loved the location. It was very elegant for a good price. It does not have microwaves. The rooms are a bit small.
POSITIVE,"We like this hotel so well, we stay there every summer when we travel to Somerset for a family reunion. Friendly staff & nice accommodations. Thanks!"
NEGATIVE,they over charge for you to call your reservation in! Didn't book here. Over priced for old and dirty hotel (per other reviews) Disliked: Value
POSITIVE,"It was a good experience, the price is on average. Room and bathroom clean. I tried the restaurant and was good"
POSITIVE,"good hotel, clean. Can't beat the location. Convenient to park the car in front of the room. Pros: cozy entrance Cons: breakfast not included Location: perfect location"
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this BW for a 2-day pleasure trip. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the room was very clean. The TV was an old school tube TV but that's ok, the price for the stay was very good. Comfortable, clean bed."
POSITIVE,It was okay. The carpet was loose. Staff was friendly but struggled with the computer and was not sharp with directions. Did not really like the location. Far from freeway and in a fairly rundown area.Pros: Clean Cons: Location and in need of upgrades.
POSITIVE,"Great road side hotel - stopped in on my way across the country with my dog, pet friendly (even gave him a treat!) Service was excellent, very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Keep up the good work."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel over spring break with my boyfriend. Room very clean, nice heated pool & jacuzzi. Used the gym, pretty basic. Friendly staff and great place to eat & grab drinks across the street at Jimmy's Famous Tavern! Relaxing view of the harbor & free parking & breakfast! Really cheap deal booking ahead. Only complaint is it was a little further then expected from local attractions like little Italy and Gaslamp district."
NEUTRAL,"Let's be realiastic, Driggs Idaho is not a garden spot and its only claim is being somewhat near The Grand Tetons. An advertised view of the majestic range was just a tiny sliver of the highest peak, but that's not why I stopped here. What you will find is a nice, comfortable place to plop that is much more reasonable than anything you could find in Jackson Hole. A big minus was the horribly disruptive road construction that caused a significant delay (09/2011) going both ways. Best bet for eating here is a better than average pizza joint next door, so just get them to bring you dinner, get a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed, and be on your way. Room Tip: All rooms were down with parking right next to the rooms."
POSITIVE,"Spent two nights on 12/30 & 12/31. Room was clean, bed comfortable and area quiet. Some stated airplane noise since it is close to airport but I only heard one plane the whole time and it was early evening. Parking lot is gated with room key access which we liked. Area was quiet and we will definitely stay there again when in Memphis. Easy access to interstate and great little restaurant right down the road, The Kettle which I will review under the restaurants. Did not eat the motel free breakfast, as we slept in each morning. The only drawback was parking. When we ret'd to our room New Year's Morning about 1:00 am, all the parking in the back was full. Even though our room was in the back, we had to park out front and walk around the building. I am not sure if they have parking spots for every room they rent. Did not appear so during our stay. We had a smoking room and it smelled so fresh, I was pleasantly surprised. Most smoking rooms smell terrible, even for a smoker, but this one did not!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here in March and were very pleased. Our room was small, but spotlessly clean. The bathroom seemed more functionally laid out than larger bathrooms in other hotels. The bed was comfortably firm. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. The property itself is not charming or historic, but all of historic Charleston is only a few steps away. We would stay here again, if we went back to Charleston."
POSITIVE,"Nice room and hotel. Bed was firmer than I like but good quality. Nothing exceptional to mention. Nice breakfast buffet, just needs something besides pork for meat choice. Really appreciated the free drink coupons after long day on the road."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is in a very nice and convenient area. There is a lot of places to shop and eat when you are here. Shops include (Marshall's,Dollar Tree,H Mart,Safeway)The indoor pool is very clean and spacious. It is also close to Bridgeport Village and Washington Square. The continental breakfast was very good includes Waffles,Cereals,Toast and Bagels. The rooms are available In 2 queens or 1 king.There are microwaves and fridges in your hotel room. The beds are very comfortable because they include lots of pillows and good mattresses. Though the fitness room is kind of small. The ice machine is on the first floor so I had to go down the stairs to get to it.m"
NEUTRAL,"I'm only give this hotel 3 stars because although it was very clean it was not the best place I've stayed at. The hotel has had some renovations such as new linens, beds, carpeting, furniture and flat screen t.v's. A nice touch for members of Best Western was the welcoming bottle of water and chocolates. I appreciated the gesture which could almost make me boost my rating one more star. However the reason why I dropped it from four to three was the bathroom. The counter has been changed to granite but whoever installed it used white grout all the way around the splash back. Also the toilet, floor, tub and tile are really outdated although clean and in good shape. The biggest issue was the tub because it had the weirdest slope/shape that could easily cause someone to fall. I've never stood in a tub so oddly shaped which makes me wonder if it was only this particular room. I did like the shower head as it could be adjusted for really tall people and really short people. Overall this hotel is probably the best you will find in this small town and was very clean therefore I would recommend this for short stays. You should also note this hotel is on the main highway which is convenient to find but we had a room at the back and I did not hear any noises coming from the highway. Couldn't say about the front though. Room Tip: If you can't do stairs or have a lot of luggage, ask for a first floor room and for a quiet room ask for a room at the back"
POSITIVE,The continental breakfast is good and waiter debbie is very helpful . I liked this place.
POSITIVE,"Could not fault anything about the hotel. Easy access to highway. Friendly staff, excellent housekeeping. Excellent value for money. Suggestion : please include stirrer with coffee pack. Observation : window could not open - I like fresh air at night."
POSITIVE,"Employees very hospitable and helpful. good breakfast. Nicely kept dining room and pool area. Good location to beach and shopping and church, resturants, etc. Looked like our room had not been updated since the early 60's. Although it was very clean, it left a lot to be desired. There were stains on the rug, there were holes in the upolstery, Needed a paint job and new drapes and bedspreads. The cupboards were black wood and looked very old. They needed to brighten up the rooms. I spoke about this when we checked out 2 days earlier than planned because of the decor. We probably would not stay there again unless it is updated."
POSITIVE,"We found the location was perfect. A few seconds from toll to 90 Thruway. Hotel was very clean and staff was accomodating. Only glitch was how the hot tub worked. May be on a self timer. Turns on and off and runs for 10 minute intervals. Bed was great and the pillows were even better !! Would definitely book there again !! Was also told what we would of paid just coming off street, saved more than $50 booking ahead ! Was thinking of being lazy and just looking for room when we got there. Glad I didn`t !!!"
POSITIVE,The staffs were very helpful and nice. Tv is too old.
POSITIVE,"The Best Western is a hard to beat deal for the size of room that occupants get. The room was cleaned in a timely manner and parking was very easy to find. Right off Corporate on 35E North with easy access to TX 121. If you can't find a good deal on hotels closer to Vista Ridge Mall, head over here."
POSITIVE,The hotel was good but the problem (that I heard the front desk attendant tell the gentleman in front of me) was that there is NO ELEVATOR. My wife does have a disability and luckily she is able to climb stairs. I asked for a room on the first floor anyway and they said I would have to upgrade from to the King Spa Suite if I wanted the first floor. I didn't think in 2011 it was legal to build a mutli-floor building without elevators.
POSITIVE,"Location, pool. Those darn traffic copters hovering above during rush hour. breakfast could have been a bit more inclusive, like maybe microwaveable egg muffins.. Next to an expressway; not much within walking distance. Although this hotel isn't ""downtown"" per se, it is within walking distance; and San Antonio has an excellent bus system (for only $1.10 per ride -- cheap!). Great staff!"
POSITIVE,"We no longer need to stay in less desireable motels hen we travel to our cabin in Souther Utah. Close to interstate, and main route south. Good resturants close by ( including Jakers a great local place with lots of choices). Good beds, pillows a little large,free grab and go breakfast. CLEAN & QUIET. First floor allows pet, Those on the top two floors do not even know pets are or have evere been in the place. Great set up. Could not be happier."
POSITIVE,Very good value close to the beach and downtown laguna.
NEGATIVE,"I have been reviewing this hotel since April 28, 2011, when I cancelled our reservation at a competing chain and booked a room here, based on the positive reviews and the encouraging responses from the Manager to any negative comments. I understood that breakfast was ""horrible"" and I was prepared to accept a minimal room--it was a great price. However, what we received was purely unacceptable. This is my first tripadvisor.com review because I was so repulsed by my stay I will avoid all Best Westerns in future (except the BW in Fargo--an exceptionally clean facility). We arrived to our room on the 4th Floor to open the door to the most dirty, run down rug I have ever had to place my feet on in a hotel (in fact, I refused to go barefoot at all and kept putting on and removing my socks when I needed to move about the room), there was a thick layer of dust coating the lighting fixture in the bathroom (literally a black mass of dust covering about a square foot of the lighting grid--please see picture). The room looks like it hasn't had a thorough cleaning or renovation in many, many years. The door knob to the bathroom was disgusting (needs replacing), the nightstand stood approximately four inches from the wall and when I peeked behind it there were Kleenexes and a thick coat of dust. I immediately checked the bed for bedbugs, as that is my standard practice. None, thankfully, were found. Throughout our stay, I tried to persuade my husband to change rooms, however, he was worried we would be moved to a worse room. We didn't want to pay more to go to another hotel, as rates would be at a premium with such short notice. So we were stuck. Saturday, the first day of our stay, we went down to breakfast as early as possible (after hearing of the congestion)--not to worry, there was no edible food to be found as the bread order hadn't come in. I believe I went with the oatmeal that day, along with some watered down coffee. Sunday, I avoided it completely, but my husband brought me up some dry toast. Monday I went down, but they were out of coffee, and I got stuck with the one-sided toaster. As the breakfast attendant was making more coffee, people kept demanding he get them some from the back, so he'd take their cup and fill it--no wonder the coffee was mostly water!! On this same day, there was no where to sit, so we took our food (my half toasted toast) to our room. The cereal containers are filthy--so filthy my husband just wanted to grab them and take them to our filthy room to clean them. The two men working there (one young, one older) seem to stand around waiting for people to approach them--they are not proactive and THEY DO NOT CLEAN. The place is a pigsty with flies EVERYWHERE. On Tuesday a woman dropped a hard-boiled egg onto the food- and crumb-smeared counter and looked at me asking if she should put it back into the egg bin--What?? Throw the thing away! I could go on and on about breakfast, but if you take your chances, you'll see what I mean. Finally, 48 hours after checking in our cards were deactivated. No one at the front desk could explain why and they did reactivate them quickly, however, we received the drill about things that will demagnitize them. We had them in the same place every day--we did nothing to demagnitize the cards, so we don't need the lecture. Also, the back door was completely broken off one day (let alone left open), the laundry room is a complete fire hazard with lint EVERYWHERE--piled up behind the machines to look like pillows have been stuffed back there. And, the panel to the one elevator was not locked. One could actually pull open the panel and view all the wiring. Perhaps not the safest elevator in Williamsburg. The only positive comments I can make about this hotel is that the air conditioner worked, the bed was comfortable, and we had a working fridge and microwave. Also, the morning person at the front counter (not sure of her name) was always pleasant. There, I've had my say...Please heed my warnings and stay far away from this hotel. And Alanna, I am sure you will feel badly about my inconveniences and my dissatisfaction, but these problems are not superficial--they run deep and they need to be addressed, with soap, hot water and massive amounts of staff training, not given apologies and lip-service in a public forum. See all photos"
POSITIVE,"This was a nice place to stay. The room was clean and well made up. Not much negative to say. The TV was an older tube-type, but the picture was sharp and had quite a few channels. The hotel was located between a busy highway and some railroad tracks but with the door closed and the HVAC on, the room was quiet. In fact, I fell asleep quickly and slept all night with no interruptions as did my wife. The desk clerks (Wayne) and a female during the day were very helpful."
NEGATIVE,"maybe 69.00 a night ,,,,just all right clean ,good location"
POSITIVE,very nice staff. Very nice pool and hot tub open 24 hour. Good breakfasr.
NEUTRAL,"Nice rooms, but when I checked out they charged my card after I paid cash now I hav an overdrawn account n have to wait 3 to 7 business days before my debit card gets out of a -$60 balance, + the arabs always made up an excuse why they left without cleaning my room, they even lied n said I put a do not disturb sign on my door 2 days.n a row n even said they were terrified of my teacup chihuahua puppy....lol.... O n I had to clean my own windows n both rooms just to.have a clear veiw, I seen kids finger prints on the window n it had sticky stuff on it... Housekeepers are LAZY!!!! Soda machines took my change, asked front desk Ray was his name for change cus I needed soda cus my throat was hurting n he threatened to call the police on me so I went all the way to the store... I felt very unappreciated, staff has neva been so bad before"
NEUTRAL,"This hotel is in a very convenient location if you plan on wine tasting. Our first room was quite noisy and the hotel staff was able to move us to a quieter room the next night. Unfortunately, the toilet was not working properly even after maintenance came in twice. We did not stay in the ""Tuscan"" section of the hotel. If we go back again, we will choose to stay there since it seemed more quiet and was newer."
POSITIVE,"I expected a decent room near the intersection of the 605 and 5 freeways but it was full of surprises. The receptionist went out of her way to get me infomation and to make me feel valued. The freeway facing room was, believe it or not, noise-free. It was also larger than expected and furnished with a table and 2 armchairs. The bed was excellent. Although not advertised a wide screen TV and microwave were provided. The bathroom was small but the oval toilet was large and the tub shower had a great shower head. There was plenty of water flow for the shower. The cost for all this was surprisingly low. Room Tip: I was in 307. I can't promise other rooms share the features I listed."
POSITIVE,The hotel was a shiny gem. The service was great! They let us lock our bicycles in a secure area. Breakfast was great. The room was comfortable and attractive... But our bikes were stolen in old town! So... If this hotel was in any other city Iwould definitely stay there again!
POSITIVE,"Room nice and cool when I arrived. King bed was very comfortable with extra pillows. Good work space and very nice flat screen tv. I could sit at the desk and see the TV also. Good size refrigerator, but no microwave. I had to use the one in thebreakfast area. Outdoor pool was nice. Lots of chairs and room to relax (and write or read). very close to shopping. 15 minutes to the beach. Convenient to pretty much everything."
POSITIVE,"I was working nearby on a business assignment and chose to BW in Madras because it was my closest option. I was not disappointed. The service was excellent, the rooms were clean. I work early in the AM and many hotels say breakfast is from 6 to 9 so they start putting out breakfast at 6. Every morning when I went down (I was in town for 5 days) breakfast and coffee were ready and was always greeted with a smile from the morning clerk. Room Tip: Choose a room downstairs close to the office. The pool and the main building block the noise from t..."
POSITIVE,"Clean, comfortable, helpful staff. We enjoyed dinner at the very nice Mexican restaurant attached to the motel."
NEGATIVE,House keeping was very poor and the overall value of the room was very expensive compared to other best westerns we have stayed at. Room Tip: Make sure yiou get a non smoking room
POSITIVE,"Don't excpect glitz or glam but the hotel is very comfortable, quiet and the staff is wonderful. We have stayed here for years. Hotel general manager Michael Brown has always been friendly and very helpful. Tia at the front desk is always welcoming. The beds are comfortable and the bedding is good quality. The included breakfast has both hot and cold entries. The housing staff keeps everything clean and fresh. It is always nice to return and have our travel needs met at a very competitive rate. Room Tip: Sometimes high school athletic teams stay there--if you think there is one ask for a third floor room but we usually stay on the first floor since it's easy to get in and out."
POSITIVE,Pros: Room was big enough to separate the child from us. Cons: Priceline needs to give the buyer the choice of smoking or nonsmoking.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is very nice...until you want to sleep. There were women passed out in the elevator floor with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths. One woman who was passed out in the lobbby floor lying in her feces. Children ran up and down the halls and stairwells all night long. I called the front desk, they assured me it was being handled. We complained the next morning....instead of an apology or trying to make things right, the employee just said,""Yeah it sux!"" I did not pay this much to get a miserable nights sleep with a 2 year old in bed with me being woke up every 10 minutes. You would think a hotel this nice would have security, or offer a free nites stay, or just something to make up for this. I won't be back thats for sure."
POSITIVE,It was cheap and comfortable. The staff was not very friendly. Also the complimentary breakfast was terrible!
POSITIVE,I really enjoyed my stay. I stayed two weekends in a row. I would love to stay again
POSITIVE,We made a decision at the last minute to attend Bobcat Day at Texas State University. Your staff was friendly and helpful.
POSITIVE,"Excellent hotel, very comfortable, quiet room, good breakfast, nice shower, convenient parking, helpful staff."
POSITIVE,"Stopped on speck as we changed our plans and left Cody a day early on way to South Dakota. This is a typical BW, but for Â£Â£Â£Â£ good value (had some terrible motels not worth Â£Â£ on this trip). rate included a free breakfast in the attached restaurant which was very good. You were allowed to pick 1 item for free and pay for any extras BUT 1 item included a full meal i.e eggs, bacon, toast etc and coffee. Clean with all amenities and a cute little outside pool. would revisit if in buffalo"
NEUTRAL,"Stayed for two nights (7th & 8th July) as a couple with a coach party of 29. Very conveniently located for touring Skye, with wonderful location right on the shore of Broadford Bay. Superb views from dining room (spent ages watching heron fishing just a few yards away). Agree that hotel needs some TLC, and that some of the public areas and the corridor to our rooms melt a little musty, but the room itself (room #114, a family room with a double bed and two single beds) was clean and comfortable, though the creaking floors and ceilings were a little tiresome. The whole experience was more or less what we expected from previous reviews, though we would probably prefer to stay at a good B&B if we were return to Skye as independent travellers."
NEGATIVE,I paid thirty percent more on expedia for this hotel. This hotel is old and smelly due to smoking rooms.Donot go to this hotel if you are a nonsmoker.I wish I could get my money back.
NEGATIVE,"Stayed here in March 2011. Decor and cleanliness needs to be improved. Someone cut themselves on something sharp in the pool, so they closed it for an hour while they fixed the sharp object. Of course that happened just as we were arriving with a group of kids who were very anxious to swim. Beds were ok, towels were thin, breakfast buffet was not plentiful and not refreshed often enough for the number of people there. They seemed understaffed."
POSITIVE,Morning breakfast
POSITIVE,"Had the pleasure of staying at this best western and was pleasently surprised. It was exceptionaly clean and the employees very helpful, and friendly. The breakfast served was excellent, and area well kept up. The beds were perfect, and the pillows made for comfort. Thanks Best Western, We will definately stay again. Room Tip: I am sure they are all excellent. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,Shuttle took forever to show up. Had to wait 40 min and call a second time to get them to come. Was ok other than that.
POSITIVE,Liked the location in relation to ECU campus.
POSITIVE,"The room is great and comfy. Staffs are helpful. My only complain is that i found a bag of popcorn in front of my door (probably some one left it), but no one cared to clean this up on my stay for a whole day. The location of the hotel is very good, near to highway and close to malls and restaurants. Anyhow, definitely a good stay."
POSITIVE,Hotel was very comfortable and quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,The hotel was great my flight got delayed and I didn't arrive until almost 5 am. No problems with the room got me set up close to the lobby. Informed me of the continental breakfast that was included. As continental breakfast's go good stuff.Staff was great.
NEUTRAL,"The room was clean and satisfactory. The beds were very comfortable - had a good night's sleep. However, the cigar smoke from the smoking room drifted through the hall ways and this was not pleasant. The smoking room is on the ground floor, so ask for a higher floor when visiting. This hotel was very close to the airport and easy to find. Pros: comfortable beds Cons: smokey hallways Location: easy to find - close to the airport"
POSITIVE,"We stayed there the 1st night we arrived from Europe, for our 3 weeks stay in the US. The hotel is very close to the airport, so for us it was conveniently situated. We were welcomed nicely. Our room was on the ground floor. We had to return 3 times to the lobby so that our card would open the door to our room. After that all was great. The room in itself was spacious, with fridge and microwave. Even on ground floor, it was not noisy at all. We informed reception that during the night airport would probably deliver 2 missing luggage, and they took good care of that issue. We ate at Ruby Tuesday that was close by, you can walk there easily. In the morning, the complimentary continental breakfast was good. So for us, it was good value for the price paid, we would not hesitate to return should we have to stay near Denver airport in the future."
NEUTRAL,"The excellent location!!! Tiny rooms-not even enough space for luggages... The last day they didn't put us bath towels and we couldnt have a normal bath, perhaps they afraid to be stolen"
NEUTRAL,"It was close to Time Squer, and short walk to supermarket, you could buy Stella Beer 6 pak @ $9.90 but on the hotel one Stella was @ $7.00 Pay alot fore littel"
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was tired and cramped, and not a good value for the money. However the location was convenient, and the view was pretty good. Dirty, tired, and cramped. No hot water."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed here the last two times I traveled to NYC.The rooms are small if you're not used to hotel rooms in NYC, but I don't find them to be uncomfortably tiny. There was enough room for a medium-sized suitcase in the closet and I found it more than adequate to spread clothes and other items onto the desk, which I don't need for doing work.Both times I found the place surprisingly quiet and stayed on a lower floor the second time I traveled.It was close to everything and right across from a theater, though both times I ended up seeing shows in other theaters. It's also next door to a chain hotel (I forget which one) and last I checked, this hotel still had better prices.Oh, and the staff was very nice at the front door and at the front desk. I particularly liked how they offer to hold your luggage if you arrive early and the room isn't ready or you check out and will still be exploring the city that day. I have never been at a hotel that offered; I always had to ask.On the downside, I don't recall the shower temperature being consistent either time. I think it was cold my first visit and too hot the second. But a sensitive dial is hardly a reason not to stay. You may have better luck.Also, when they last renovated, things weren't done perfectly. The first time, the towel rack was not affixed to the bathroom wall well. I could see the screw and could have pulled it off the wall getting out of the shower had I not noticed it first. It didn't prevent me from staying again. The second time I noticed that the sink faucet wasn't flush with the vanity, but there were no leaks. Little things like this catch my attention, but don't affect my rating because they're silly little things. Pros: Close restaurants Quiet"
POSITIVE,"I found the room very clean and comfortable, and liked the closeness to the beach and Pier, along with the closeness to shopping."
POSITIVE,"This motel is just off of Highway 64 in southern Indiana. We were staying there for an event at the nearby Lincoln Parks (which are beautiful & educational, btw) and our choices for this area were slim to none. I am sure that this hotel gets a lot more guests during the Holiday World season, but we stayed on a cold, rainy late September weekend so there weren't many other guests. The hotel is clean, quiet and offered the usual, but satisfactory complimentary breakfast. Comfortable rooms, comfortable beds. The sink area is just inside the door and not enclosed in the bathroom area which may be an issue for some people, but didn't bother us. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again. There is a Denny's, some type of fast food (Wendy's?) and a gas station close by."
POSITIVE,Great accomodations. no issues. [...]
NEGATIVE,"noticed blood on the bed.in no way was i bleeding called the front desk they came up. reasured me that they would take care of it and discount room. then i get a charge for 150.00 for the sheets.called corprate because i could not get a manager on the phone.corprate got the manager to call. Jose was very rude about the situation and say they change sheets everyday i dont belive this room had funny smell and was not my blood on the bed.dont stay at this hotel waste of money Liked: Location Disliked: Service, Food, Value"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean, the staff efficient and courteous, the price reasonable. Its location, next to a subway station, is another big plus."
NEGATIVE,"The rooms are a good size and clean (apart from the dead bug IN the bed when I pulled back the sheets - at least it was dead.) From there on in it was downhill. Incredibly noisy plumbing meant that when anyone within 2 or 3 rooms distance ran a tap or flushed the loo it woke you. It was not possible to switch the aircon unit to permanently on (and mask external noise), when it reached it's lowest setting (which was not cool) it switched off completely - great for utilities saving for the hotel, not so good for the customer. Fairly thin walls added to the disruption and the ventilation system in the toilets transmitted the smell of smoke into the non-smoking room. There are a number of other hotels nearby that might do better. Room Tip: Choose another hotel"
POSITIVE,"This is a story about a fork. You know that state your'e in when you finally get to your hotel after a long trip. Tired, ready to unpack and can't wait to eat dinner? That was exactly how I was feeling when I checked in last night at the Best Western in Bonnyville. I threw down my suitcase, and took out the rotissierre chicken and salad that I had just picked up at the Sobeys on the way in. I look out a little towel, and a cool bottle of water. I was ready to eat! Then to my horror, I discovered. I HAD NO FORK! So, downstairs I went (in plaid pajamas and no socks), and was told by Meghan at the front desk. that the Best Western was a Green hotel and didn't give out disposable forks. I was sad. She solved my problems by getting me a metal fork from the breakfast room. That made me happy. Happily I went upstairs with my metal forks, I called my dinner companion Marta and we had a carnage of chicken with torn lettuce everywhere. Sated and full, I happily drifted off to sleep. The next day I went down for breakfast, and was again pleasantly surprised. They had bacon, eggs, cinnamon toast, and a full set up for waffles. This was much better than when I stayed at the Neighbors Inn , where breakfast closed at 8am. 8am? Who closes breakfast at 8? The Best Western breakfast was till 10am, and for late risers they even have a snack/coffee bar. It runs all day, and you can grab a coffee, orange and a muffin. Remember though, this isn't a story about the breakfast bar, or the gym (which is quite nice), it's about a fork. The reason it's about a fork is that , the very next day, while working in the room, I heard a knock knock knocking at my door. It was Meghan from the front desk, the Best Western had made a ""We Care"" package for me because of the wierdness with the fork. In the package was bottled water, popcorn, snacks , chocolates and a ""We care"" sign. Wow. Color me impressed and rub my tummy! That's customer service, not only did they solve the original problem, but they went over and aboard the next day. I can see why this is ranked the #1 hotel in Bonnyville. The beds are comfy, the rooms are nice (non smoky in the non smokers room), and the service as I mentioned in my story . Fantastic. I give this hotel the Samson Stamp of Approval . Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to at least one night here if you can."
POSITIVE,"The bed was so comfy, I haven slept that good in a long time! I was warm and very comfortable. Thanks for the wonderful hospitality!"
POSITIVE,Hotel was clean and beds were comfortable. It was just a few minutes from my sister house and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff was friendly. We arrived early but had to wait until 3 PM to check in but we reserved a King Bed that wasn't clean yet and were offered to change to a Double Bed room that was ready but preferred to keep the King Bed. The free breakfast was okay but not the best I have seen. Overall I would stay again.
NEGATIVE,"rooms were decent, but everything is old. Felt like I transported back to the 60's. The rate is definitley due to the location, not the quality of the place. Staff was very friendly though."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is clean, bright, up to date, nice place to eat good service. The only downside was the small room."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was very nicely redone recently, features a full service resterant. friday nights are fish night very good. pool area closed due to season. rooms were nicely done very comfortable. Room Tip: both the 2nd and 1st levels u can park at room level due to elevation. 2nd level is in the front. craker barrel resterant is also right out the front door. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"We selected the Best Western Classic Inn initially as the halfway point on a Christmas road trip, and liked it so well we stayed there again on the return journey. It was easy to find from Interstate 70, and though we got in late, desk personnel were pleasant and efficient, the room very clean and comfortable. We had our dog with us (another reason [?] for choosing the Best Western) and everyone was so nice and friendly about her. The free Continental breakfast was better than expected. On the return trip we had time to enjoy the heated salt water pool and had pizza delivered to our room. At least as pleased with the Best Western Classic the second time around."
NEGATIVE,"I wanted to book a nice hotel for the last night of a 2 week holiday in Florida before flying back to Europe. I chose the PW Premier, and regretted it greatly! The hotel is new, but unpersonal and bland. The front office staff has a bad attitude, the type that asks you for your confirmation number when arriving... at every other hotel during our trip they could find us by our last name (btw the only family with our last name, so no confusions possible). We had booked a suite, which turned out to be a large room with a sofa bed. In all other hotels this meant two connecting rooms. The room was also the closest one to the busy avenue and therefore was very noisy. The heating was blowing full blast when we entered through a mini-split system (no central aircon). We left for dinner as we had just driven accross the country, and then I left to return our rental car. I had planned to take the airport shuttle back, but it never arrived. I waited over an hour, and saw all the other shuttles pass by twice or three times. I eventually took a taxi, but had lost an hour. I arrived back at the room at 10.30, to find that the sofa bed had sheets! I called front desk who told me that house keeping was not there and he was alone (!), and if I could wait an hour. NO! We had an early transatlantic flight and I was in the same room as my parents who are in their mid seventies... After an argument the front desk person left to search for what he could find; two sheets and a pillow case. No pillow, no comforter. I suggested to simply put me in another room in order to solution an issue, but apparently he couldn't. After a bad nights sleep I asked to speak to the hotel manager. I was helped by the front office manager who apologized and offered to provide me with a free night whenever I wanted to give them a second chance. Upto today I have not received his email, over a month later!! There is a big selection of hotels close to the aiport, choose another one. I heard the Hilton is very nice and the price similar, even lower. Room Tip: Ask to be as far away as possible from the noisy avenue."
POSITIVE,"Large room, clean, airy and bright, and surprisingly nice walking closet, comfortable for 4 to stay; Soft lounging chair and matching table. Great study desk. Everything available in room, just missing microwave. Free breakfast, internet, parking,workout room and pool."
NEUTRAL,stayed at the hotel for an overnight while visiting universal studio - hollywood. it's not far from the universal so it's ok. the room was just average. it's ok if you just want to sleep and do other things around.
POSITIVE,V
NEGATIVE,"We stayed here two nights. The first night it was ok. On the second night, the thin walls, hollow ceilings and out door smoking meant talking and laughing guests at night. Note that this Best Western is located next to a Trailer Park--not a pretty sight. The hotel is just ok but I cannot recommend it to anyone due to the level of nosie made by the other guests. Room Tip: Avoid as it gets noisy at night."
POSITIVE,Everything was good except for the room cleaning. They did not empty the trash and replace soap and coffie and the small stuff plus the vacum cleaner must have been broke. all in all it was a good stay.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here during a women's conference. Rooms are extremely nice, some even with fireplaces. Staff is exceptional. Offer great rates, too!"
NEGATIVE,"A strange man loitered in front of our room as we got our stuff out of the car. As we came up the stairs to our 2nd floor room he moved on. Room was clean, but still seemed strange. Cheap CFL lighting makes it feel like a walmart inside. Wifi works but only on one laptop. TV is not a flat screen, an old CTR that has really bad reception. All channels have some fuzz over them. No laundry, was advertised. Front desk had no forks, only spoons. Shower was strong and hot, towels seemed of a recent vintage. Pool and hot tub filled with touring families. Would not come again. Liked: Service Disliked: Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"This place was perfect for our half way stop to Washington. The receptionist was very accommodating and nice. She gave us a first floor room as we preferred and free awesome cookies. The room had a frig and microwave and full breakfast included, gym and pool. Very clean and towel origami! Well worth it with a AAA discount. Liked: Service, Food, Rooms"
POSITIVE,I'd never been here and was told this was a great little place. Love the dim lighting and decor. It relaxes you immediately upon arrival through the front door. Happy Hour prices are a little high for martini cocktails but they are tasty. I didn't stay for the food but it looked and smelled so good. I'm eager to come back and try food next time. Service was great even though the place was packed on a Friday Happy Hour time. At least I know if I go at the same time again I can get seating immediately. There was a wait for tables by the time we left at 7.
POSITIVE,"Close to restaurants, very clean, 5 minutes drive to Lake Placid, the view was not that great, we had a back room and we could here noise from the next building if you kept you're window open"
NEGATIVE,"Nice room, clean but dark. We stayed there specifically because they advertise as dog friendly. However be aware their policy is not to leave the dog in attended so you are out of luck if you want to step out for dinner or something. They are strict about their policy so I would recommend to find a hotel that allows you to leave the dog crated. There are many. This really put a damper on our weekend away. Liked: Rooms"
POSITIVE,"Definitely one of the best B&Bâs Ive stayed at, gorgeous Victorian town house which is really welcoming with clean, comfortable, spacious rooms with on suite bathroom (which I had a lovely hot shower :~) ), great breakfastâ¦. has a very homey feel to it. Its located in a safe area of York with a short walking distance to the main part of the City, or if youâre not a walker you can get one of the many buses that run that way or a short taxi drive! I will be staying there again & will be recommending it to friends & family as well"
NEUTRAL,Location in the heart of Lake Placid Very noisy room air conditioner
NEGATIVE,Try different hotels!
POSITIVE,This is a great hotel! Super clean and the staff is amazing. The free breakfast was delicious and there was a lot to choose from. The room was really nice I loved the 4 shower heads in the shower. I was there for a convention and the space was great. I hope Keller rents from them again
NEGATIVE,"My room is small. Uncomfortable mattress. The front desk service, breakfast, and shuttle are all terrible. The so-called free shuttle bus driver asked for tips ($2 just from the hotel to tropicana, three blocks away). Anyway, it is Las Vegas, everything cost money. The only good thing they have is breakfast. If you do not care about the breakfast, just [?] go to imperial palace, right in the middle of the strips. I had very good experience in other Best Western hotels, except this one."
POSITIVE,"Older facility that shows its age, but was convenient, clean and serviceable for housing a soccer tournament group, Staff was nice and helpful. Equipment in exercise room was out of service. Breakfast was great and included in the price. We got what we paid for and we were happy."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is in a prime spot for anyone wanting to go to Valley Fair, the Renaissance Festival, Misty Lake casino or anything in and around Shakopee. All are just minutes away and the hotel is off of several primary roads.Staff was great! We got discounted tickets to both Valley Fair and the Renaissance Festival at the front desk.The hotel breakfast was very good with waffel machines, scrambled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy, etc..Place was very clean and very well maintained!"
POSITIVE,"What a pleasant surprise! I booked 2 rooms for my family and my expectation was that this property was just a typical Best Western. Wrong! I don't know its history, but I suspect the ""King George"" part indicates that it was another small hotel at one time. The staff is exactly what you would expect in Charleston - charming, charming, charming. Our rooms were extremely nice with granite tops in the bath and room. Very nice products in bath and big fluffy towels. There is a small bar with reduced prices for happy hour and complimentary cheese and fruit. I live about 1 1/2 hours from Charleston and visit frequently. This will be my hotel of choice from now on. Pros: Free Internet"
POSITIVE,I would definitely stay again the staff was wonderful and the room was very clean I would recommend others to stay there.Pros: The friendly workers very clean and in a perfect location. Cons: The back could of used a little cleaning up at the entrance where had to go into to get to my room.
NEGATIVE,"My father & I stayed here last weekend, August 19th-21st, to visit family & friends. I picked this hotel because of my rewards card and also how close it was for us and cheaper than staying directly on the beach. I wish I remembered the name of the young lady that was working when we checked in on Friday and the next night as they were the only 2 who had any customer service training! Once we got to the room, I noticed that we were in a square of rooms and ours was the only non-smoking surrounded by 3 smoking rooms. That doesn't even make any sense. Once inside there was no desk for using my laptop or for a place for my father to eat his take out that we ordered. Upon going to get a couple of sodas out of the machine, I soon discovered that all of them were completely empty on both floors. This was Friday night around 7pm going into the weekend....what hotel does that? I was up & down all night becasue the bottom sheet they had used was too large and would not stay on the bed. The tub the next morning was slippery and my father almost slipped. That could of been a disaster.....I went to the desk the next morning and told them the problems, which he supposedly wrote down.....came in that afternoon, nothing changed and the next morning when we checked out the same guy did not ask me about our stay, ask us if anthing was better; of course he couldn't because he knew he had not done anything about them....no compensation was given or anything....I will never stay there again. If you are contemplating staying there to save a few bucks....trust me it is not worth it!! Spend the extra $$$ and have an enjoyable stay...don't sell you & your family short!!"
NEGATIVE,"I booked this hotel and was somewhat skeptical about the hotel after viewing the pictures, but reading the reviews on Trip Advisor somewhat eased my reservations. Needless to say, my intuition was exactly right about this hotel. These other reviews must be written by employees or owners of the hotel because this hotel is terrible. Updated? Is that a joke? The decor in this hotel is easily from the 80s early 90s and looks grungy. Check in was actually very pleasant as there was a woman there (Evelyn or Yvonne I believe was her name) who was very accommodating, witty, and acted as if she genuinely cared about the comfort of the guests. She was great and deserves 5 stars. I went into the room, and at first glance didn't think it was so bad, but as I started to observe different things, my opinion immediately changed. With the drapes open, the person in the room across from my room could see directly into my room and vice versa. The bed was lumpy and had stains on the comforter, the shower was dirty and stained near the drain, and to top that off, there was a roach crawling up the wall! The roach did it for me, and I immediately left. I checked into another hotel and called and reported the issues to the front desk clerk that was working that night, and this lady could care less about the problems that I experienced. She seemed almost offended that I called the room dirty as if she was the person who had personally cleaned it, and I was taking a jab at her work. She said there were no rooms available to change to that night and referred me to the morning clerk. Luckily, it was the first woman from check-in, and she changed the room and offered her apologies. The second room was slightly better and cleaner, but I would not stay here ever again."
NEGATIVE,"My husband and I had stayed in the hotel earlier this year when travelling for our business. The last time, the room was adequate for the price. This time, our room was infested with earwigs. They were crawling out of a vent in the wall and were all over the walls, ceiling, and in the bed. Very unpleasant. I would not recommend this hotel or ever stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Our stay at this hotel was superb. For the price that we payed, which included a full buffet breakfast, it was unbelievable. We will definately be staying there again and again..... The staff were friendly, curtious and professional. We would recommend to hotel to anyone. It was clean and geared towards customer satisfaction."
POSITIVE,"Great Stay! Clean, comfortable, convenient, courteous and complimentary considerate."
POSITIVE,"Staff was very friendly, lobby and rooms were clean and well furnished. Dont even consider the other hotels in Taylor this is the only one at this time that is acceptable."
POSITIVE,Reservation was taken care of very nice check-in. No problems. Room was clean and comfortable. Easy to get on internet. Nice fluffy towels. Breakfast was really nice. It was well stocked and the food was great. Probably the best I have had at a Best Western. Very friendly people. Will look forward to staying there again.
NEUTRAL,"We stayed in the Gold Mine Suite the first night and could not stand the smoke. Even though it is a ""non-smoking"" room it was on the top floor of the smoking wing. On our way back through we asked for the room farthest from the smoking area, next door to the breakfast room"" and it was better."
NEGATIVE,"We only stayed at this place for 2 nights and I would have preferred to stay on the beach for 2 days (and this was when it was Hurricane Irene weather!) There are bugs in the bed (we came out covered in bites), the room was not even close to clean and the maid left us without towels so we had to use pool towels that did not cover a thing! The man behind the desk was rude and they weren't helpful at all. You are MILES away from anything that you want and next to a very busy gas station and main road. It wasn't pleasant at all. Honestly never ever stay there, I would never go back and never recommend it to anyone. Room Tip: Don't stay here. Ever."
NEGATIVE,"When I booked this hotel, I was told one price. When I checked out I was charged nearly $20 more with hidden fees and costs. I thought it was ridiculous. I would never stay here again. They do not even consider late check out. The room was nice, but it was overpriced considering the area that it is in. Because of the pool most of the first floor smells [?] like chlorine."
POSITIVE,the hotel delivered on what was expected of the brand for the most part. the only down sides were the fact that current construction makes exiting to the hotel or from the hotel minimally inconvenient. also the advertised breakfast leaves much to be desired as far as food options and taste. i would have paid for a more expensive room with better breakfast [?] options had i known the best western breakfast would be a low-budget snack.
NEUTRAL,Good Employees were complaining the hotel was understaffed. Little or no bell hop service. Common rest rooms were not clean.
POSITIVE,"My boyfriend and I were en route to South Carolina after spending the a week in Florida. We decided to stop in Georgia. I looked up hotels and the Best Western Plus was highly rated. The staff is wonderful. The front entrance and lobby was clean, festive (for the holidays) and quiet. The price was great! Rhonda had quoted me a price over the phone and when we arrived, Melissa was able to accomodate the price. Melissa is professional, courteous and well spoken. In the morning, we asked for a later check-out (11:30 instead of 11 am) and Katherine and Sherry happily did so. They were both professional, courteous and had a spark of Southern charm. The room was quiet and clean. The bed was quite comfortable. The wireless internet worked well. The coffee was great. It was close to distance to I-95. I've already recommended this particular hotel to several people who travel from the North to the South."
POSITIVE,"This place was perfect! It was affordable, clean and conveniently located. We had 2 rooms (2 families both traveling with toddlers), both were clean and everything worked. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Free hot breakfast was fine: biscuits and gravy, waffles, fruit, toast, cereal, egg, sausage, and hot/cold drinks. Wal-Mart, Logan's, Mexican food, Chinese food and a dollar tree in the next parking lot over. I-24 1/2 a block away. 10 mins max to downtown. We would definitely stay here again if traveling to Chattanooga. NO BUGS as stated in another review. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"It was very comfortable, a lovely big room with everything provided. The free coffee in the foyer was welcome and free laundry was really useful after a weeks touring holiday!! The breakfast ham was rather dried up after being kept warm..... Did you find this review helpful? yes no"
POSITIVE,"Well it was for our anniversary of 1 year,so just relax and spend time together , took in the beach , pier , pavillion { see super trooper } unfortunately my wife had a chest infection so spent time in the room Decor was very nice , staff really helpful and friendly"
POSITIVE,"On our recent two-day stay, we encountered two problems. 1. The first night, someone threw up in the pool. According to Texas health law, the management needs to immediately clear the pool of people and ""shock"" it with chlorine. The desk person on duty was not interested in helping. He did not do anything and did not report it. When I reported it to the manager the next morning, they were prompt in taking care of the issue. 2. The hotel tried to charge us full price and double-charge us instead of the Expedia price that was paid a month in advance. The person checking us in (same lazy pool guy) messed up the paperwork. It took a bit to sort out and made us late. 3. The hot tub was taken out, but the hotel advertises one."
POSITIVE,"The room had a wonderful view and was literally right on the beach which was great. Our room was on the second floor right next to the outdoor seating for the restuarant. Even with a wedding party dining there on a Monday night it was not too noisy when the patio door was closed. We were able to get wifi in our room since my husband brought his lap top. The flat screen TV had cable but not many channels to choose from and no local stations at all. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping did a great job of tidying the room while we were out. The tile floor felt slightly slimy except for immediately after it was mopped and I always had to wipe my feet off before I put on my shoes or sandles but that was no big deal. We saw the little tiny ant like bugs but they were only in the bathroom and around the refrigerator area. A few mosiqitoes in the room but we had the patio door open alot to enjoy the tropical air. When we slept we used the AC which worked perfectly. The plane noise was not an issue, we noticed the noise when we were on the beach but not so much in the room. It is great that they stop flying after 8pm and not before 9 am. We had drinks and sandwiches in the cabana on our first day there and the service was good. My husband went back there for a sandwhich another day and couldn't get waited on. The bartender was a different person and she said the computer was down and was looking rather frazzled. We had good snorkeling and no problem getting a couple of chairs but the beach towels were another story entirely. We stayed there 6 nights and 6 days. It took us 4 days in a row of constantly going down to the front desk in the morning before we finally got a couple of beach towels. We were always told they would be ready in about an hour to 1 1/2 hours and were given extra bath towels. On the morning of day four the front desk staff offered to have someone put them in our room when they were ready which was great. That would have been a nice offer on day one. The fitness room is tiny, it has a flat screen TV and about four pieces of equipment. Not bad if you are in there alone but feels cramped when anyone joins you. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone but I would not want to walk with my luggage from the airport. It is close and there is a nice sidewalk so if you don't have a car that would be an option if you were trying to save money."
NEGATIVE,"We went to this property without any research as we needed a last-minute place to sleep. It's in a not-so-nice area. However, the lobby looked reasonably inviting so I decided to go for it. We were told to drive to the back of the building and enter through a back door to get to our room. The parking lot was very dark. I was amazed that THERE WAS NO SECURITY ON THE BACK DOOR!! It was wide open!! There was no card reader!!! I entered the hallway and immediately noticed the unpleasant smell and stains. I looked at the room too-- it looked OK, but I decided that the security issue was a deal breaker. We left and found a nice Holiday Inn in Arlington (about 10 minutes away). I will be working to get the charge off of my credit card."
POSITIVE,"We had a short stay here for some business meetings in the area. The hotel is located in downtown Newark, within 10 minutes' walk to Newark's Penn Station, or one stop on the light rail. They also offer a free shuttle to the station and also to EWR. Also: free parking! Can't top it for convenience. As a Diamond member in the BW program, I got an upgrade to the Governor's Suite, which was very nice. While the room did not smell of smoke, I was nevertheless surprised to see ashtrays with matches ready to go! Perhaps the hotel should consider going non-smoking as so many other properties already have. The wireless Internet worked well in the evening, but was completely non-functional the next morning. Fortunately, I was able to borrow an Ethernet cable at the front desk. The room was quite comfortable and well laid out. The bathroom featured a shower and a whirlpool tub, and definitely felt cramped due to its layout. It would be time to refresh some aspects of the room, in particular the cracked counter top in the bathroom. The other amenities were in reasonable condition, but again, starting to show their age. The bed was very comfortable, with soft sheets and a variety of pillows to choose from. Two small bottles of water were provided in the room. The breakfast, which is served in a basement room, could certainly have a bit more variety. How about some waffles, yogurt, more fruit? The business center is also in the basement, but each computer features a payment device, so no free use is possible. This is a bit of a downer in this day and age. The area around the hotel is not the best. The park next door attracts many homeless people or others who simply hang around, both day and night. Walking in the area is likely not recommended. Overall this is a great place to stay in Newark, or even if traveling to New York. From the hotel to New York's Penn Station is less than 1/2 hour."
NEUTRAL,"We settled for this hotel because hotels closer to or in DC were either very expensive or had terrible reviews. It is right on a couple bus lines that will take you to a couple of metro stations (same line though). We usually took the bus to the Balston station which took 30 minutes. Then it was another 20 minutes or so on the metro (depending on where you were going). The parking is free which is a definite plus. The hotel is older and it shows in little ways - but nothing major. The biggest complaint I had was the mattress - it was very uncomfortable. The complimentary wi-fi was pretty iffy (kept losing the signal) but there was a computer in the lobby that I always used because no one else was ever on it. There are restaurants nearby (which is good since breakfast was not included with the room). All in all, it was satisfactory. It met our needs."
POSITIVE,This hotel offerred us a king suite for 3 people for a very reasonable price. It included a hot breakfast that changed daily and a light supper that changed daily with beverages. The only thing that would have made it better was if the TV was on a pedestal where it could move to be viewed by people in the bed and then switched for when they were on the couch. The kitchen part was very nice and would be great for a family.
NEUTRAL,"Hotel room neat and ample room. Found some hair in bathtub. Ran out of breakfast food 15 minutes prior to end of breakfast. Asked for cot and had to jump through hoops to get one. Cheap price, but..."
POSITIVE,We stayed two nights at the Monte Carlo. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The towels were of high quality. We were disapointed that there was no in room coffee. I guess they want you to get room service or buy. We dont think they should have a $15 resort fee for each night. I can get inroom coffee and internet at a super 8 or less expensive motel
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at the monte carlo twice over the years. The people are always friendly and it's generally a nice hotel. They pump this aroma into the air system that makes it one of the nicer smelling hotels if that means anything. The rooms were nice, and I cant really think of anything bad to say about the hotel. The only time I got upset was one day I stayed all night and planned on taking a nap the next day. The music coming from the pool area made it impossible to sleep in the room during the day. I guess we could of had our room moved, but we just dealt with it. Nice food court and the Monte is in a decent location on the strip. If your looking for a cheap lunch you can go right across the street to the showcase where they have a decent food court"
POSITIVE,"My Boyfriend and I had never been to Vegas before and we had heard really great things about this hotel and the awesome rates, so we decided to stay there. We were kinda lost when we got there but the staff was super friendly and showed us our way around the hotel. We were also impressed on the location it is in the middle of the strip and close to everything which was a big plus! Our room was super clean and the bed was super comfy after a long day of walking it was nice to relax because even the hotel was on the Strip our room was super quiet it was so nice! We were wondering about what to do and came across the Operations manager he was so helpful on helping find our way around vegas and also on all the great hotel ammendities it was such a great experiance we will definatley be recommending the casino royale, because we absolutely enjoyed our stay here!!"
POSITIVE,"i like this place. Ive read very mixed reviews about this club and hesitated if its even worth a visit. But I had a good time there. What I like about this place is that as long as you RSVP on facebook, you get in for free before 11pm, otherwise its free before 10pm. The venue is spacious and i like their multiple dance floors. I have to say that (at least on the day when i was there) Trinity has one of the best crowds in Seattle clubs. i would definitely come back again!"
NEGATIVE,"We stayed in a room right off the lobby on a Saturday night on the way home from a long drive since 8AM that morning, and needed to sleep before the next leg of the trip.There was a bright ""crime"" light right outside the window that seemed to show upward but actually blared into the room, too. I could have gotten past that, but there was something of a basketball game going on on the second floor above us (and seemingly all over the hotel) that, we guess, was so loud that the desk clerk had to turn up the volume on the lobby TV so that she could hear her movie. We could hear that from our room, too. Very unprofessional and rude. My husband got up and walked the halls to 1) see what was going on that might settle down in a while and 2) see if there might be a more quiet area of the hotel that we could move to. No positive finding on both counts. Kids running around, people milling about both inside the hotel and out in the parking lot, other dissatisfied and tired travelers investigating...bad scene. The ceiling, walls, and doors are so thin there was no getting a quiet spot. We packed up and left. The desk clerk didn't turn down the volume on her TV show to speak with me when I said I was checking out for all the noise--she didn't seem to care. I found the hotel in coupon book, but it wasn't the coupon that attracted me to it--what counted for me that it's advertised as brand new. Well, it's not. The room itself was fine, the beds were okay, but the bathroom was beat and the shower curtain was about 2"" short. If I book with Choice again (for myself, my husband has now vowed ""never again"") I will ask if the hotel has blocks of rooms booked and, if so, can I be booked far away and above the block of rooms. I suggest others do the same, especially here. Room Tip: I wouldn't waste time trying to find a good room in the place, but if you must stop there, avoid..."
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at this property in the past and I recently stayed for five days in September. Location is great on the south side of ""The Strip"". It has easy access to a free tram running to the Belagio. It is close proximity to lots of restaurants & shopping. It has some quick eats on the property like Starbucks, McDonalds, etc... The casino is not as large as others, but it's not too small either. The pool area is very nice with a lazy river and wave pool. However, the wave pool was closed our entire stay and they did not let us know even at check-in. The hotel and rooms were clean. The rooms were not new, but didn't feel dated and we liked the bed. Inside the room, it can be noisy from above, music from the pool and through the door. It is Las Vegas, so I guess you have to expect that a bit. MGM properties do charge resort fees plus tax which is kind of like forcing people to pay for daily internet connection. That is definitely not consumer friendly and many other resorts do not charge it, so be sure to add that into any comparisons. We also needed a late check-out of one hour which they could not accomodate which was disappointing. Overall, the Monte Carlo is a good value and I would stay there again. I'd ask about anything you plan to use ahead of time before booking just in case. Room Tip: Rooms facing the pool will have loud music during the day if the pool is open. We were on the 30th..."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express (an older 2 floor unit ) in Sharon only because we couldn't find a room within a 30 mile radius of Boston - may have explained our overpriced room. The hotel was fully booked up open check-in. This motel is tired ......the hallways really smell awful ....get the feeling that this was probably a ``smoking only`` motel in its previous life. Somewhat sad because the rooms are fairly spacious, somewhat clean equipped with a nice sofa - couch type chair, smaller flat screen TV's, comfortable beds but tired washrooms. Shower is completely outdated ....traces of mildew on caulking inside bath ....no reason for that - especially when they should be thoroughly cleaned on a quasi daily basis !!!!! Room had complimentary Wi-Fi which was nice - fairly strong signal from my laptop ... but I couldn't sign in with my tablet for some reason. Motel offers complimentary continental style breakfast - fairly well stocked - fruits, yogourts, eggs, sausages, juices, etc .... up until 10:00 am - it does the job just fine. The little business center which is shared with the small breakfast area is simply disastrous. The desktop computer is simply an archaic relic ..... computer screen is outdated with awful resolution on a 15 inch screen. Internet usage is an insult on that system ....no intelligent work can be accomplished from that desktop ....forget about trying to open emails on the fly Â«( Gmail, Hotmail, etc...) computer takes hours to load any page ...... really inexplicable considering that you can probably purchase a fairly basic efficient computer- screen for the approximate sum of $500. (spent approx 1 hour trying to print electronic baseball tickets from stub-hub). If your a football fan ....motel is located approx 3 miles from Patriot Place ( home of the Patriots) which offers good shopping and dining. Other than that ......really nothing else to do in Sharon. Motel is conveniently located close to the highway."
POSITIVE,"We checked in on Sunday, Nov 6 a bit early and our room was ready. I was happy to see how close it is to the airport, as that was our reason for selecting it. I want every minute I can to enjoy St. Thomas and this was the best location. We had been on St. John for days prior to ending our vacation on St. Thomas. The very nice, competent hotel clerk got us settled in with no problems at all. The hotel is three stories and there are no elevators. Our third floor room was just fine and included a nice view of the beach. Yes, the beach is right outside the door. Plenty of lounge chairs were available, it was not a crowded place at all. There is a nice sized pool and an outdoor bar right next to each other-- a nice cast of characters for fun and interest. We asked for a masseuse and within 40 minutes she was at our door. Right after we headed to the pool to relax and then for a nice walk on the beach. I have no idea how long the beach is but it is decent and clean! There are some rocky areas on each far end. There are fun, water crafts but we did not rent any. After staying out to catch the beautiful sunset we opted for dinner at the hotel restaurant. The restaurant is set up with a roof but no walls/door so you can feel the temps and catch the scenes. The offerings for dinner are standard-- mahi mahi, steak, fettucine alfredo, eggplant parmesan, etc. and the portions are pretty big. Unfortunately, I got terribly sick at 2 am after my 9 pm meal at the restaurant. I was pretty sick for about five hours before I could move around. We did not bother to contact the restaurant but it was the only food I had that day other than apples/oranges/bananas, bottled water, packaged snacks and bagels. Hey, at least I got better. Monday morning we walked onto the beach around 7 am after my morning ginger ale to see if I felt better. After a short sit we went into the water. No one was on the beach yet. Finally, we saw a few local folks-- mostly seniors taking a morning walk and swim-- and chatted with them. Two of the ladies were about 75 years old and they walk eight miles each morning. We eventually took a taxi for a trip to Water Island but we missed the ferry over and decided to go shopping instead. The shopping area is about two miles down the road ($8.00 pp by taxi) and right near the cruise ships. We then decided to head to Magens Bay for the rest of our day before flying home. Best Western Emerald kindly held our luggage for us until we returned from Magens Bay. Very nice staff, not too chatty but did a great job for us. *The hotel gives two complimentary drink tickets if you stay more than one night. Wow, the rum punch knocked me out (but I'm a lightweight)! *The concierge does not come on duty until 10 am and I think that's late *The people who run the water crafts also don't arrive until 10 am I will return to the Best Western Emerald and would recommend it to anyone. I think it is best for your last day if you want to run around doing last minute errands or trying to get the last bit of St. Thomas sun & fun! Room Tip: Third floor so you can look far out and not at people on the beach. Would not want a floor level ro..."
POSITIVE,"We stayed for five nights here in May. Nice big spacious rooms, lovely pool - very spanish feel. the beds were soft maybe too soft! Front of staff were very helpful. The only thing that i didn't like is when you check in they don't give you a map of the hotel or the facilities that the hotel offers. I wouldn't have known about the breakfast they offer if it wasn't for the reviews on here. Breakfast is okay - cereal, toasts, yogurts, etc. I also didn't know that they have a computer that you can go on next to to the breakfast room if it wasn't for trip advisor. The no 2 bus stops outside the hotel. Nice and convient. Overall a good hotel in West Hollywood."
POSITIVE,"Our recent stay at the Monte Carlo was overall enjoyable except for a couple of annoyances that other travelers may find equally annoying. The noise from surrounding rooms was a little high. You could hear other guests from adjoining rooms talking. The noise level from the pool was also a bit high during the day. If you are a sports and race bettor, the race and sports book is a bit small. they didn't broadcast any races from Monmouth over the weekend because ""they didn't have enough TV's"" but oddly they had dog racing on two screens from the identical track. The hotel is OK, but personally I am not going back for the reasons cited."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in June for 3 nights (week days) and we were so pleased about our choice. This hotel is simply fantastic!!! From check in to check out, we couldn't have had a better experience! It was our honeymoon and the staff made sure before we arrived that we had a nice room. Our room was on the pool side, the room was big, the bed so comfy! It was very clean. The bathroom was big and very clean as well. There is a private secure car park for the hotel, very useful in LA! I think we had a to pay for it but it was not more expensive than any other hotels we had a look at. The hotel is located in a very safe area, it is the perfect location, 10 min drive from Beverly Hills and 10 min drive to Hollywood Blvd. I think driving in LA is not difficult at all and it is not that busy. When we wanted to go to Hollywood Blvd, reception told us that we should leave the car and take the bus. However we were not keen with all our cameras, camcorders, etc... We decided to drive and it was quick and easy/cheap to park near Hollywood Walk of Fame. The breakfast was amazing, so many choices (bread, muffins, croissants, pains au chocolat, pains aux raisins, waffles, yoghourts, orange juice, apple juice, etc...). The staff at the hotel was really nice. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and we would go again!"
POSITIVE,"I was looking for a lower-priced base while my son and I checked out the university and decided (based on TripAdvisor reviews) to stay here. It's obviously not an Omni or Marriott but it WAS nicely decorated, very clean, and close enough to campus. The included breakfast offered cereals, boiled eggs, do-it-yourself waffles, bagels, toast, and fruit. The only drawback was that more tables are needed. My suggestion would be to replace the two wing chairs nearest the dining area with two more tables. The pool area was walled with plenty of chairs and loungers. There's even a water fountain! It was a 8.5' pool which my son and I both enjoyed. The water was sparkling clear. Folks using walkers, canes, or wheelchairs need to be aware that getting to the office (or next door dining area) from ANY room involves either stairs OR driving to the front side of the office. Likewise, the pool area is about three steps up from the walkway running outside the office and ""top"" level of the facility. If you'd like a room close to the pool or dining area, ask for the top level next to the pool, but be aware that you'll be climbing a flight of stairs up from the parking area. With my AAA card, I received a $50.99 nightly rate, which I was thrilled with. Also, my iPhone charger was left behind and the staff bent over backwards to retrieve it and make arrangements to mail it to me. My ratings are in comparison to similar facilities and not to a 5 star hotel."
POSITIVE,Pleasantly surprised when making last minute reservations..this was a clean room - very comfortable bed...cold air - great price - actually a bargain...I've stayed in higher priced hotels and the room wasn't any better...
NEGATIVE,"My husband had a business meeting here so his company paid for our room. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the odor! It was a mix of a damp moldy basement and overpowering air freshener. The second thing was how old and rundown the place looked, stained hall walls, nasty elevators, and disgusting carpet! The only terrible thing in my room besides the carpet and the old bedspread was how hard and uncomfortable the bed was! Overall it is what I would except from a Motel 6, but not from a comfort inn!"
POSITIVE,"Room was very nice, staff was very friendly, and ample parking. 2 restaurants withing walking distance. Very satisfied."
POSITIVE,"Visited the Monte Carlo last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. This was our first trip to Vegas. I was hesitant to stay here after reading many of the other reviews, but I had a very positive experience. Pros: Room was clean, no bugs, affordable. Close to airport, short walking distance to other hotels, restaurants, malls, shops (CVS, Ross), and free tram to Crystals Center City and Bellagio hotels. Nice food court and restaurants in the hotel. Cons: Not as modern with as many amenities as some of the other hotels visited on The Strip, check-in process was slow. Housekeeping kept forgetting to leave washcloths so I had to call the front desk or catch housekeeping in the hall while making their rounds to as for more. Room Tip: Take advantage of the free tram from the Monte Carlo to the Crystals City Center shopping center and..."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here for a bachelor party in April. The room was nothing fancy but was in good shape and had plenty of space. We had a 2 queen bed with a strip view. The staff at the hotel were great as were the pool staff. Minus 5 Ice Bar was a fun stop and the casino was a little quieter than others but I thought that was good because it meant you could get on a table easier or find a slot machine you liked easier. The location is very good, walking distance to several other casinos. Overall I know our whole group enjoyed Monte Carlo and I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,Very nice breakfast. Free internet service. Nice size room
POSITIVE,The hotel is good value for money offering a complimentary breakfast to all guests - this was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Its location some 3 miles from the Airport meant you got a good nights sleep. The shuttle from/to the airport and the close by Penn Station was every half hour and the driver was most accommodating - nothingÂ was too much trouble. From Newark Penn Station it is a 25 minute ride into the heart of New York - $5 each way ($2.25 for seniors). Save yourself hundreds of dollars and stay a little way out and then spend it on things that really matter.
POSITIVE,"Iâm reviewing this property because it is exceptionally clean!! We stay in many hotel/motels and this is worthy of a positive review because it is clean. No mold, dust or anything and, the staff was great. If you do stay hear there is an excellent restaurant adjacent to the property."
POSITIVE,The restaurant was the highlight - they have excellant chef - food presented extremely well and good value for the money - overall the hotel package good value for money Not a complaint as such but the bathroom could have a wide shelf near wash basin to handle wash bags and a hook maybe on back of door to hang clothes.
POSITIVE,"My Fiance and I were doing the drive up the coast to San Fran and needed somewhere to rest. We hopped on Trip advisor and saw great reviews for this place. We were very happy with the customer service, made us feel like family :) The room was clean and beds were comfortable. We will Defiantly stay here again if we drive up the coast again!"
POSITIVE,@Robin yes the pool is up there and the sun deck is right outside the pool house very refreshing to take a dip in the pool then go dry out on the sun deck...!!!!!!!
POSITIVE,"My sister and I stayed at the Best Wesern Inn of St Charles for two nights while attending a wedding in nearby Batavia. The location was great...close to everything. Both of us were surprised how big and nice the rooms were. But the thing that made the stay perfect was the staff...or should I just say Jennifer!! She seemed to be on call 24 hours a day and answered every question and request we threw at her, always with a cheerful smile. She made our stay at a good hotel great. Good job!!"
NEGATIVE,Ok coppers I confess.I ordered the hit.hey they owed me money.thats what happens in Chicago when youz dont pay your street taxes and don't buy our beer..LOL
NEUTRAL,"My wife and 2 our grandchildren were in town for a family reunion, and decided to make a mini vacation out of it. Since Canton overall is within driving distance to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame, Amish Country....It isworth a few extra days to explore. BEST WESTERN PLUS North Canton Inn & Suites, is well kept outside and in the public areas, with a nice indoor pool, hot tub, fitness/work-out area (small but functional), Continental Breakfast, and even washers and dryers for guests. The room was only average/slightly above average for a higher end budget hotel, $84.00 per night for 4 nights, but it did have comfortable beds, and linens. Now the down sides, the rooms (and I was in 2 different ones) smelled musty, even though the hallways smelled great. The bathtub barely drained at all, and even though I reported it to the desk attendant the morning of our 2nd day it was never repaired. The room needed a lot of small cosmetic repairs, bathroom ceiling cracked from a leak, desk chair needed upholstering, TV remote had a mind of its own, etc. The breakfast was what you would expect, Waffle Iron Waffles Monday-Friday, compliments of a disagreeable elderly AA women, whom obviously had rather have not been there, gravy and biscuits, boiled eggs, bagels, Danish etc....It's OK My biggest complaint is that the only give you 2 sets of towels in the rooms, and it is like pulling teeth to get additional....I had to wait on extra wash cloths because they were in the dryer....If you look at any of the maid carts it is obvious that they do not have enough linens, and other supplies to fully stock the rooms...you hear them in the halls talking about pulling linens from out of order rooms to finish up rentable rooms.....Sad In Closing this hotel has promise, but needs a little work and alot more towels, but is a little better than Fairfield Inn, and Red Roof Inn in Canton both of which we have stayed in."
POSITIVE,"Traveling with a 65 lb Golden Retriever, Bailey, means doing some homework before hitting the road! Many hotels who advertise as being ""pet friendly"" charge up to an additional $75 per nite; will accept larger pets; put you in a smoking room etc. I called ahead to double check their pet policy and was assured this was NOT going to happen. From this first call I was impressed with the sincere friendly approach of the staff. I was not disappointed. The front desk staff - Cederick - was welcoming and helpful. There are outside areas designated for the dogs which are quite sizable and clean. It would appear RESPONSIBLE pet owners are the norm. The room was adequately sized with two comfortable double beds. We had a microwave and good sized mini fridge. And it was all clean and sparkly. The ouside hotel property was also well maintained. The amusement park was not yet opened for the seasn (which was great for Bailey as she got to chase her ball in the huge Park parking lot) but obviously quite convienent with a direct walking entrance from the hotel to the park. There is a 24 hr Denny 's on the hotel property plus Uno's pizza. Uno's is only open during the Park's season. A small bar is also on the property. We imagined parents taking turns at the bar after the kids were asleep following a long day at the Park! There is a Burger King across the highway but no other eating options at that exit. Hotel staff does provide a list of resturants and shopping available at nearby Ashland exit. Room Tip: Some rooms face the Parks parking lot and you can see the rides. Might be more noisy than the other..."
POSITIVE,Very nice hotel with very courteous personnel. The complimentary breakfast was good but the setup needs to be improved.
POSITIVE,"My wife and my two corgi dogs spent four nights between Christmas and New Years at the Ocean View Resort, and we were pleased by every aspect. We got the prepaid rate by booking well in advance, and got excellent value. The hotel is positioned on Seaside's Promenade. This is a 12-foot-wide concrete sidewalk that separates the town from the beach. There is a low dune between the prom and the beach proper, and this means that people in lower-floor, ocean-front rooms don't really get the benefit of a sea view unless they stand. The beach is very wide, so the distance from the hotel to the surf is probably more than 200 yards. I cannot claim to be impressed by the Prom - there are few businesses along it, other than hotels. I'd rather walk along the beach or the touristy main drag called Broadway. Dogs are permitted off-leash on the beach, but nowhere else. In the off-season, this is a great dog beach. The hotel has an ideal location. Broadway is a short walk, and Safeway, Rite-Aid and an outlet mall are a short drive away. The hotel has five stories, and dogs are permitted on the lower two. If you have a dog and an oceanfront room, you should ask for the second floor for the view. First floor rooms have no direct access to the Prom, and pedestrians can look right in. Since there are few pet-friendly hotels in the area, it seemed that every room on the lower floors had a dog or two. This was not a problem, but you'll want to be careful opening your door since there were often dogs in the hallway. They do make you sign a form promising to keep your pets off the furniture and not to leave them alone in the room. The fee is $20 per pet per night, but I managed to talk that down when I called to book because we had two dogs for four nights - $160! Our Ocean-Front Pet-Friendly room was very nice. The tv was about 36"", wide-screen, but I could not find hi-def programming (I didn't look hard). There was a DVD/VCR with only standard-def output. The fixed queen-sized bed was soft and comfortable, although the edges seemed lower than the middle. There was also a Murphy bed, but we did not open it. We had a two-burner stove, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. A packet of Boyd's coffee was provided each day, but my coffee-drinking wife did not care for it. (I think she prefers stronger coffee.) The refrigerator was loud (hence 4 stars, not 5), but opening the balcony door fixed that because the surf was louder. One of the bedside table lamps was not connected because the cord could not reach a socket. The front desk provided an extension cord when I asked. The weather was no good for sitting on the balcony, but the hotel did provide two plastic chairs for the balcony. There was a very nice fireplace. It had a half-hour timer that you need to keep resetting. A wind storm (70 mph!) blew out the pilot light, but a maintenance man put that right minutes after we called. The tub/shower was just okay. Not really a tub for taking a nice bath. The hotel restaurant had a limited selection of Italian entrees, but they were very tasty and well-presented. Our room was so nice that we did not bother with the lounge. I was very happy with every aspect of service at the hotel. The desk, restaurant, maintenance and cleaning staff were all polite, helpful and friendly. I loathe Seaside in the summer, but in the off-season it is very nice. If I return, I definitely will stay in the Ocean View Resort again."
POSITIVE,"I always knew that my first trip to California would include a visit to Napa. After doing plenty of research on where I should stay, I discovered the Elm House Inn and had a gut feeling that this was the hotel I was looking for. When I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, I was met with a welcoming smile and the news that I was just in time for Cookie Hour, which I later learned would be my favorite hour of the day during my days spent in Napa. Guests were hanging out near the fireplace already enjoying homemade cookies, which were the most delicious cookies Iâve ever had (and I do love cookies). This moment gave me all the reassurance I needed to know that I made the right choice when choosing the Elm House Inn. The hotel was beyond lovely â my room was clean and had a huge television with plenty of channels for me to watch while I got ready for bed each night making me feel at home. The garden features a beautiful sitting area that is perfect for photos documenting your trip and the outside patio is a great option for having breakfast year round since there is a heater set up. Regardless of where you choose to enjoy your breakfast (indoors or outdoors), the Elm House Inn breakfast should not be missed. It was definitely not your average continental breakfast. There were fresh waffles and treats being made all morning and a delicious fruit salad offered to help kick start your day. Donât worry if you donât have a full filled itinerary when you arrive for your time spent in Napa. Tom, Connie, and Kelly at the front desk all had suggestions for activities (not just limited to wine tasting, though they do have a wealth of knowledge in that department as well), and can help arrange reservations as well as winery visits for you. While there, I definitely had my fair share of wine (if you get the chance to visit Cakebread â their Chardonnay is the perfect glass to toast your vacation) and ate enough delicious meals within the few days to last me all month. Also, the Beer Can Chicken at Bounty Hunter (a close walk/drive from the Elm House Inn) definitely is a hit for dinner. Be prepared to eat A LOT â and donât be surprised if you canât finish the abundance of food with your friends, we could not though we certainly tried. I would be doing a disservice to everyone if I failed to remind you how great cookie hour was. These cookies are truly like none other, just like the Elm House Inn is. If you get the opportunity to visit Napa you will not be disappointed with your decision to stay at the Elm House Inn. The owners should be very proud of their beautiful hotel and pleased that they have such a great staff to help make the trip that much more enjoyable. With so much to do in Napa, I know I will be making a returning visit in the near future. While I donât know the exact date yet, I can tell you one thing for sure â I will most definitely be staying at the Elm House Inn again!"
NEGATIVE,"Took forever to check in, the lady was trying to be friendly, but wasn't. . . The internet sucked, couldn't stay connected to save a life."
POSITIVE,"I made reservations thru the internet for 3 rooms. The check in was fast, All 3 rooms were clean and side be side. Breakfast was good and well stocked. Location close to Deer field Beach and Festival Flea Market. I will stay here again."
NEUTRAL,"The parking slots are too tight and there is no enough parking for all the rooms during the week end Also check in time is 3PM, that's not good"
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at this hotel over the past 12 years, probably 50 or 60 times. Some of the staff is still there, an unbelievable retention rate for this industry. The value is great; free hot breakfast, free exercise tokens to a nearby gym, etc. This hotel does not feel like a chain stay, more like a friendly bed and breakfast. Pros: Excellent value, friendly staff, and upgraded facilities."
POSITIVE,Everything was top quality - we would definitely stay again

POSITIVE,Beautiful !
POSITIVE,"Free secure Parking, free breakfast (waffles, fruit, toast, muffens, hard boiled eggs, etc.), great location. just down from the parliament building and the museum and downtown. Inner Habour 2 minute walk. Had a room with 2 double beds and a kitchen ( stove and fridge & microwave) and large flat screen TV. Close to resturants and shopping."
NEUTRAL,"Place needs major refreshing. The room and all the furnishings are worn and old. My TV had no picture, and it was an ancient old school type. The staff was courteous and helpful. Though again, everything from the sadly meager complimentary breakfast to the broken down business center computer gave away the truth. This place isn't doing enough to stayÂ relevant."
NEUTRAL,Decent location close to food & sites. Although it's on a major thoroughfare it's fairly quiet. Room was well kept and clean. Only complaint is that the TV is plugged into a switch outlet. If you don't turn on the light then no TV.
NEUTRAL,"Overall comfortable room. Free continental breakfast was nice enough. Our room was within 50 yards of the highway, so you could hear the noise all night. Pros: Free breakfast. Cons: Too close to the highway."
NEGATIVE,"Pros: Did not like anything about this hotel. Cons: Location, noisy, shabby rooms, shabby public area - very old and gross hotel."
POSITIVE,"Clean, functional rooms, non-smoking throughout. Traffic noise"
NEUTRAL,Close to alot of attractions . nT the best of the best bt irÃ© good for the price!!
POSITIVE,"Nice room, good shower, breakfast was ok."
POSITIVE,"We decided to stay right over the Canadian border the night before heading into Montreal. What a great find. We had to go next door to the hotel to get our key. The lady at the desk was so welcoming. She said we have been waiting for you. The pool was actually open. Check in was so quick. Our room was clean and large. The next morning we went next door for our continental breakfast. Wow, we were served scramble eggs, toast, cheese, fruit and coffee free with our room. That alone was worth it. Wendy at the front desk was terrific. We exchanged American money for Canadian money for only a 4.00 service charge. I thought it was quite worth it and I received a coupon for 5.00 off the duty free store on the other side of the highway. We used that on our way home to buy candy for the ride home. Please do not hesitate to stay here. So happy I found this on trip advisor."
NEUTRAL,"I was staying here for one night before I caught my flight out. Talk about nickle and diming you to death. $17 for an ""activity"" fee, $1 for the use of the safe, the list goes on and on. All in told the price of the hotel winds up being about $30 more than advertised. Combined that with the website said there was a shuttle to the airport (there wasn't, I had to cab it) overall I am not too impressed with the hotel. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. The food in the onsite restaurant was ok, but nothing of note."
POSITIVE,"Room was comfortable, bathrooms are a bit dated, but clean. Pool area is huge with lots of games, great place for an overnight with the kids. Pros: Close to the business park and Lambeau field. Cons: Computer was down, had to wait 30 minutes to get my room"
POSITIVE,Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were nice and clean. Pros: Staff was great!
NEGATIVE,"Floor was wet from the refrig leaking in room, but had no vacancy to move us. Wet and smell were less than desirable. Soft, lumpy pillows made up for the discomfort."
POSITIVE,"This hotel reminds me of the Titanic just before it sunk. The attached 125 room motel and pool are abandoned ruins. The attached nightclub and liquor store are beginning to look rundown. The sheets, gas station, one block away heading into town has a security guard on duty. Pros: Quick access to major highways."
POSITIVE,"Clean and friendly hotel. I stayed here after the New Year celebration. I found the hotel quiet, no late night parties going on and had a great rest."
POSITIVE,"this was a very nice hotel; friendly staff and a large, clean, pretty room. I have paid more for something not nearly as nice so I thought it was a bargain especially since breakfast was included. It was tucked back away from the main road so traffic noise was not a problem and it was close to the interstate. The only difficulty is the access pointÂ is not straight forward."
POSITIVE,Convenient to Airport. Clean. Will use this hotel again.
POSITIVE,I enjoyed it and would stay there again. Pros: The beds were great. Cons: No elevators.
POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the stay, would stay again. Pros: The atmosphere was so Fredericksburg, the pool area and the rocking chairs on the porch."
POSITIVE,"The front desk staff did not appear to be particularly interested in their jobs, but the room was clean and comfortable, the shower was always hot with perfect water pressure, and the price was more than reasonable. I'll continue to recommend it."
NEGATIVE,"Would not recommend for family or female traveling alone, dark and smelly public areas, cable was out for most of the time (2 nights)that I stayed there. Very disappointed, with the 2 1/2 rating I expected more. Will never stay at this hotel on my regular visits to Columbus. A 1 star rating is more than it deserves. Cons: Outdated, Felt unsafe, seemed dirty and dark."
NEGATIVE,"Poor Pros: They even charge for a poor breakfast and amazing. Cons: poor room layout, breakfast charing and poor location."
POSITIVE,"We regularly stay in Best Westerns throughout Canada and the U.S. and have rarely been unsatisfied, but the Best Western Inner Harbour is one of the best ones that we've stayed at. The staff were all very cordial, the room was A-1, and the area was perfect for us. Room Tip: The corner rooms are the best, with two balconies and lots of light."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed mid week, early June, solo traveler. Nice big room but smallish bathroom, indoor pool (not used by me), free Wi-fi, passable breakfast if you skip the hot food."
POSITIVE,P-L-E-A-S-E make us fan of the week... we C-O-L-D Canadians need some encouragement this time of the year! :-)
POSITIVE,"Shopping, eating & Wallace! Seminar/conference was pretty good too!"
POSITIVE,We just needed a quick place to stay on our two day drive home. This did the job. Mattress was not the most comfortable but the rooms were clean and staff was nice.
POSITIVE,"Walking distance to Disneyland. Nice, clean rooms. Strongly recommended!!"
NEUTRAL,"We have stayed at the Best Western Caribe on three occasions, all before or after a vacation to another island. Although the price of a room was higher this time than in previous visits, we would probably stay here again because it is so convenient to get to the airport.. Here are the things we liked and disliked about the property. 1. We found the front desk staff very friendly, helpful and informative during each visit. 2. We inevitably arrived each time several hours before check in and our rooms weren't ready. The front desk staff tagged our luggage and kept in it a secure room so that we could go out and explore until the room was ready. 3. You can literally walk to and from the airport - which is great because taxi's are expensive in St. Thomas. 4. During each of our visits we had a vey nice room with a very nice view of Lindbergh Bay. 5. We didn't care much for the onsite restaurant Fajitas, but they offer a free shuttle to the Best Western Emerald Bay which had a nice restaurant on site. 6. In room wireless and also a computer in the lobby to print out airline tickets. 7. Nice bar area down by Fajitas. 8. Pool overlooking Lindbergh Bay. 9. Although the hotel is located right next to the airport, we only heard a few airplanes taking off and landing and it didn't bother our sleep Didn't like as much: 1. Breakfast at Fajitas. They offer a buffet, but eggs aren't included. The price of a basic breakfast was about $12.95. We ate dinner there once and thought it was just o.k. 2. No real beach, just a built up sandy area with some beach chairs 3. We were not able to check in early during any of our visits, in fact, during one visit, we couldn't get in until 6p.m. 4. Needed to get a taxi to go shopping, sightseeing and to catch a ferry The Best Western Caribe offers nice rooms with a nice view (at least the ones we've had!) - although the price is not cheap! We personally would not book this hotel for a vacation destination, but the convenience to the airport will keep us coming back for a night before or after a vacation."
POSITIVE,"BEst MOtel !!!!!!!! Loved it Rahul Sharma... Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I checked in to this hotel. From the outside it looks like it was built quite a few years ago, but the inside is both modern and comfortable. Obviously the ownership completely remodeled this hotel. Price was competitive for the area, it was located close to the Interstate and shopping areas, complimentary breakfastÂ and a great modern gym."
POSITIVE,"Basic hotel accommodation that is about as close as you get to the Disneyland entrance. Nothing special about the room and in fact it is a bit worn. But for the price and location, it can't be beat and they throw in a passable free continental breakfast. Room Tip: Away from the highway."
POSITIVE,"Stayed overnight for a baby shower event on 2/19/2011. The room was clean and pre-heated! That was a bonus, since it was cold and snowing outside! The complimentary breakfast was outstanding! Bacon & Eggs, etc. Wow, we were amazed at what was offered for breakfast. The staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back when we visit our friends again! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
NEGATIVE,"This place is a complete dump! I would never recommend anyone staying here. MY husband has been staying here regularly for the last 2 months for work, not by choice. When he checks in there is always something wrong. Doors not locking or opening properly, Queen Size mattresses on twin sized box springs. Just this week he went to go use the hot tub only to find that it was ICE cold. He went to go and tell their horrible front desk/management staff and they said ""yeah its broken"" well wouldn't you think you would put a sign up to tell your guests. The microwaves have holes in them, the fridges hardly keep things cold and the housekeeping staff are lazy pieces of work. They put up do not disturb signs on the doors so they don't have to clean the rooms. Not to mention the top floor of this place is reserved as college dorms for a local near by college. This place is a disgrace and should be taken down, management removed. Horrible."
POSITIVE,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone...very nice and clean. Excellent desk service. All arounds, a very nice visit!"
NEGATIVE,The hotel was a dump. The interior was old and musty. There was visible mildew in places. The HVAC has never been cleaned. The floors were damp and spongy. I was afraid to let my children play on them. The spread had a faint stain on it. The onlyreason you get two stars is because the staff was very kind. Will never go back!!!!
NEUTRAL,"Stayed here 4 nights with the wife in the week after Easter in one of the Superior rooms. Room was fine, quiet with a balcony which allowed us to sit out in the sun. Breakfast wasn't the best I have had as the English breakfast was buffet style. The hotel has a reasonably large pool, jacuzzi and two gyms, along with a sauna. Probably best suited to an older clientelle. Room Tip: Pay a little extra for the Superior rooms"
POSITIVE,"I have been staying at the Best Western A Wayfarer's Inn in Kingman since the early1990s. My job with the state health department requires me to travel across Arizona. After my first stay I always make it a point to stay at this facility. I found it to be a quite, relaxing place and I always get a good nights sleep. I liked the mattresses so much that I purchased the same BeautyRest for my home. The breakfast selection is second to none. I just wish all of my nights at motels could be this rewarding. Ralph Graves"
POSITIVE,"Convenience and quality Nice hotel in the Rogue Valley that is close to many major freeways. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Very quaint location with great amenities & restaurants all around. Disliked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,only concern was that the bed was not very comfortable and we had to get extra towels from the desk for the pool. Pros: pretty grounds that rambled Cons: beds Location: worked great for us
POSITIVE,"Good value, Clean nice place to stay.Very roomy, Nice size Fridge with small freezer."
POSITIVE,"Good price value based on location, room cleanliness, comfort and size. Lobby and hallways are dated. Would be nice to see the exterior power washed. Would stay again."
POSITIVE,"Stayed for a weekend in San Francisco. Hotel location is not an advantage because all of the hotels are in the same area - where you will want to be if you are wanting to see the sights. The hotel had been decorated and was nice and the room I had was not large but had a big mirror which gave the impression. Big TV, big fridge ok bathroom a window with no view. AC a bit clunky. Ante rooms nothing much to speak of. Reception is really cluttered and you have to queue. Did I like it - ok - would I go back - no. Pros: Nice location for tourism - but no different than the other hotels Cons: Reception Location: Near to the Fishermans wharf and the emarcadero."
POSITIVE,"More than I expected, even tho towels smelled wonderful!"
NEUTRAL,"The staff were friendly, but this hotel was currently under renovations. The room it self was fine, however, the hallway walls and carpet were being redone. The whirlpool wasn't working either. The continental breakfast was just ok, as the juice dispenser didin't work consistently."
NEGATIVE,"We only stayed for the one night. We have mixed reviews Hotel and the room were very clean. The bed was quite comfortable. We were however pretty disappointed in the morning with breakfast. The juice machine was empty. Nobody refilled even though manager was notified. There were no utensils for the guests to use when getting hot food from trays. SmallÂ styraphome plates. I believe this is a first for me. Usually you get ceramic/glass plates. The waffle maker did not seem to be working properly, however, this could be that the patrons did not quite know how to use it. I had a bowl of cereal. The milk was warm. In my opinion it should have been sitting in a bowl of ice at the very least. If you just looking for a place to lay your head for one night, I would recommend this motel. Longer than one night however, I would stay somewhere else next time."
POSITIVE,"This hotel met and exceeded all of my expectations! Although I was busy and unable to explore all of the hotel's amenities, I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of the property that I did have the opportunity to experience. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, while the property was well-decorated & clean. A member of management even took the time duringcheck-out to ensure that I enjoyed my stay and asked if I had any suggestions as to how they could improve. I told him I'd be sure to recommend the property to all family & friends as I would certainly return. ..."
POSITIVE,"the pool was great, nice and warm! the room (2 queens) felt a little cramped, but clean. the breakfast was delicious!"
POSITIVE,I can't wait to go back! Everyone was very helpful.
POSITIVE,"Had the pleasure of staying at the King Charles Inn for 3 nights. Very very clean! Our king size bed room had two nice upholstered chairs with foot stools and the room featured a walk out onto a balcony with two rocking chairs to enjoy the fresh air. There were a couple of small issues like a leaky ice bucket, but all was quickly corrected! Manager Maureen Sheridan made us feel like we were in her home. She was great with dinner suggestions and with general knowledge about Charleston. Breakfast buffet was good, hot, and tasty. They offer cheese and crackers in the afternoon and fresh baked cookies at night. The pool deck is elevated off the street level and you can sit on the pool deck and watch the world as they walk Meeting Street out front of the hotel. Room Tip: Get a king room with a balcony"
NEGATIVE,Only after we had schlepped all our bags down to the room did we find that this was a smoking room. The room was also used after room service had made the beds. Food and ironing board left out in the room. Service desk was not helpful.
POSITIVE,"Enjoyed our 3 nights here. Friendly, helpful staff. Room was clean, comfortable, quiet and roomy. Good choices for breakfast. Close to public transport but a bit far from airport and shopping centres."
POSITIVE,"This was such a wonderful hotel, I actually stayed here 2 nights. Â The rooms are more like mini suites, with a luxurious bed, flat screen TV, nice comfy chairs to sit in, and a nice desk/workstation area with WiFi They offer a complimentary breakfast in the mornings, which is pretty good. Also, if you find that you've run out of a basic travel item, such as toothpaste, you can go down to the front desk, and you will be given a travel size of what you need."
POSITIVE,"Hotel staff was great. Room was clean. Breakfast was better than expected for a continental breakfast. They had waffles, biscuits and gravy, toast, fruit etc. Would recommend staying here."
NEGATIVE,Room full of mosquitos some were smashed on the walls and maid did not clean them off. Bed sheets had holes in them. One pillow case had blood stains....the next day maid did not change the sheets same sheets on the bed as the night before....Asked for change of sheets twice that day finally later that night hotel maint brought them. floor was not clean.Â Maid was not professional.
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed myself while staying at this hotel. Everyone was very nice, and courteous. I will be coming back sometime in the future."
NEUTRAL,"My daughter and I stayed here for a dance competition at a local community college. The staff is very friendly and responsive. The rooms are small, but clean. Through my error, we got a smoking room. Due to the dance competition, we couldn't switch, but they quickly brought an ozone room deodorizer. Area seems very safe. Maria's Ristorante 2 blocks away is nice. Free Continental breakfast includes scrambled & hard-bouled eggs and sausage patties with the usual coffee, tea, juice, bread, bagel, pastry farem parking is free but tight."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel was not as it was described. Upon check-in, I could not even get the front door open to get to the desk. Once I got inside, I checked in, went to my room and found it not as described as well. It was in need of a good cleaning. Left right then and drove 2 hours to my destination and found a hotel there. Will not be booking at this hotel again."
POSITIVE,"Great value; however quality could be a little better. Do not plan on eating at the restaurant but was a 1980s Denny's. Pros: Good value for area. Cons: Walls extremely thin, and you can hear all rooms around, above, and walkways outside."
NEUTRAL,"Great value. Skip eating at Spain restaurant. The pool is for lap swimming only. Liked: Rooms, Value Disliked: Service, Location, Food"
NEUTRAL,The desk clerks at night and during the day were extremely nice. I reserved the hotel last minute on Expedia.com and the amenities I requested were not there. No refrigerator in the room. No microwave and I did not receive a handicapped accessible room. The room was clean;however the house keeper did not come and clean the room. I stayed Friday & Saturday. I had to call the front desk for towels and she was gracious enough to bring them herself. I received a better rate than the website for Sat stay and received a discount due to house keeping not cleaning the room. The hotel is in a good location to spend a little less than hotels on the beach and near the outlet and fast food resturants. Its close to 95 so it was easy for traveling.
POSITIVE,VERY NICE ROOMS PLENT OF PILLOWS AND ROOM WAS COMFORTABLE . BREAKFAST CONVIENT FOR BUSY MORNING OR LEISURELY MORNINGS
POSITIVE,"Pros: Friendly staff and new, and clean rooms. Cons: Location - Brooklyn."
POSITIVE,Our stay at the Best Western Envoy Suites was a pleasant four day stay that enhanced our visit with family. I would recommend the Best Western to anyone who travel to the East end of Louisville. Pros: Convenient location; good breakfast; and good service.
POSITIVE,Breakfast very expensive. $60 for 3 person; way two much!
POSITIVE,The hotel was comfortable. The breakfast was good. The internet worked well. The pool was OK. The staff took care of business well.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was clean and comfortable. Not a true suite, but the room had an extra area which was nice to set up a Pack-n-Play crib for our 2 year old son. We had some difficulty getting a good night's sleep on our first night due to the closeness of I-75 and traffic noise. We asked for room on the frontside of the hotel for second night and it was much better."
NEUTRAL,"Water would not get hot in shower, lukewarm. No tv remote in room. Asked for a remote to be brought up to room. It never arrived our whole stay."
POSITIVE,"Have stayed here many times and will continue to. Hidden gem with outstanding service every time and great breakfast. Have tried other hotels in Albuquerque including higher end ones, but will continue staying here every time we are in town."
POSITIVE,"It's no five star but then you're not paying five star rates either. It was very comfortable, clean, and surprisingly quiet at night. The hot breafast was well worth it. It saved time and money. Pros: Quiet, decent breakfast, friendly staff. Cons: Smelled like a hotel. Exercise room not very big Location: Good location. Close to most thing you need. Central. 20 minutes to the beach if there's no traffic."
POSITIVE,"Way more than a 2 1/2 star hotel. Loved the awesome hot breakfast every morning. Not just waffles but eggs, sausage, biscuits, and gravy besides the usual donuts, bagels, fruit etc. The pool was very clean and never crowded. Our room was very spacious and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. The management was so helpful whenever we had questions regarding things to do in Fort Myers. This hotel could not be beat for the price we paid. Very easy to get to from the airport and good location for driving to beaches and Sanibel and Captive islands. Loved shelling on all the various beaches. Great Trip"
POSITIVE,Hotel was nice but rooms were on the smaller size. The pools were nice for younger kids but the shallow pool's water was frigid. Met the needs we expected.
NEGATIVE,"Based on previous reviews I expected a pleasent experience, but unfortunately the rooms felt small, smelled weird, and made strange noises when walking across the floor. The beds were too hard and the parking spaces ridiculously small (where a normal sized car couldn't fit). However, the breakfast in the morning was decent and they did allow us to checkÂ in early. The location wasn't that great, but you did have access to other points of interest nearby. The bottom line is that I would probably choose another place before going back here; saving a few bucks doesn't make it worth it."
POSITIVE,"This was our second stay at this hotel and we enjoyed the comfort of our room. The bed was very welcoming especially since we were out in the rain and wind this past weekend. Also, the Continential Breakfast has a nice selection of fruit, cereal, coffees, etc. The front desk staff was very nice and polite to everyone they spoke to. Whenever we planÂ another visit to Brooklyn we will stay here."
NEGATIVE,"just a tired hotel. Rooms are small. furnishings are tacky. breakfast is silly it is so weak. We would not stay again. Only real positive is a great view from our suite on the top floor. oh, yea we could not take the room we purchased so had to upgrade once we arrived. Pros: view but only from top floor. and very proximate to the town. easy walk"
POSITIVE,"I definitely would like to stay at this hotel again. For the price and comfort the hotel has to offer, this hotel is an excellent bargain. Subway is just across the street and it took only 15 min to the nearest station statue of liberty. Love the breakfast and its service (foods always topped up). The bellboy (from Haiti) was always ever so helpful-Â he didn't expect tips from us but we gave him anyway cos his sincere help (unlike bellboys in manhattan hotel). Cheers!!!"
NEUTRAL,"Our vehicle was parked in front of the door in broad daylight & unlocked briefly as we were checking out, less than 7 minutes, that was enough for some one to get in & steal electronics. A nice place, but be careful. We have stayed many times, but never again."
POSITIVE,"Very happy with this hotel, especially for the price. Rooms and beds were very comfortable, nice having fridge and microwave. Both pools were very nice and kids all had fun, liked the hours too 8am-10:30pm. Breakfast was crowded, but somewhat expected. Variety wasn't too bad - kids loved the waffles with strawberries. Staff very nice and accommodating. Having stayed at severalother hotels in St.George we would definitely stay here again (only other hotels that were better cost twice as much). ... Pros: Rooms nicely upgraded and beds very comfortable. Cons: Breakfast area cramped."
POSITIVE,"A clean inexpensive place to spend a night. Comfortable bed tired and worn out decor. Good shower. Dated and worn out decor. Heating- ventilation hard to control. Standard definition TV on flat screen HD set. Cheap and scratchy bedding - overwashed and overused like the rest of the hotel. Friendly staff. Paid a low price and got what I paid for. Pros: Comfortable beds, good shower. Cons: Dated decor in need of remodeling."
POSITIVE,"After the hotel down the street we had stayed at in the past tried to gouge us because it was a football weekend (double the usual cost), we decided to try the Best Western & will continue to do so on our trips to Lubbock. The front desk was very helpful & our room was spotless. The free breakfast was a hot breakfast & was very good. Since we have a child at Texas Tech, we travel to Lubbock several times a year & the Best Western will see us again."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. Morning breakfast a flop. Definitely would stay again with Priceline price. Minus cold pool and ear infection, pool was huge and clean. Pros: Spacious rooms, clean, fridge and microwave appreciated. Cons: Ear infection from pool. Rough crowd in pool had to take baby out didn't feel safe. Loud hallways at night."
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay, quiet, comfortable, safe. Free breakfast, clean hotel. Friendly staff, no problems at all, loved my stay!"
POSITIVE,"Room was large, and well appointed, Beds were super comfy, and room was very clean. Excellent free breakfast."
NEGATIVE,Smell The rooms and the corridors smell like an ashtray.
POSITIVE,"Pros: Clean, quiet, would be excellent for family with children, the pool is certainly nice, not deep and a play area for kids."
NEGATIVE,"I travel a lot for work and stay in a lot of hotels. Typically, I donât write a lot of reviews, but I felt it a public duty to dissuade as many people as possible from staying at this hotel. Upon arrival, the aesthetic of the hotel appears to be fairly agreeable, with this continuing as you enter into the lobby. However, unfortunately, this is where it ends. As you move away from the lobby area towards the rooms, it becomes apparent that the general upkeep of the hotel requires serious attention, with this becoming readily apparent upon entry into the room. For example, all the furniture is very worn and damaged to some degree. With regards to the bathroom and in particular the hot tub, the less said, the better. Also, although the hotel doesnât appear to be in a particularly undesirable location, it should be noted that the additional entrances to the hotel do not have any security measures enabled. The hotel also attempted on day three to tell me I needed to check out, despite them me showing my reservation. I was merely greeted with a âthatâs weird; our reservation system does not show your reservation for todayâ; I was as equally perplexed, as I had booked through the Best Western Website. The only people I would advise to stay at the hotel are those that have no other recourse to stay at another location."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Great lounge, fantastic breakfast, helpful staff and very good location. Cons: Poolside room was a little noisy."
NEUTRAL,"I have stayed at this hotel previously for months at a time. This year there have been a few changes that, in my opinion, have not made my stay as good. Firstly, the hotel is very convenient to the A2 road which makes getting to it no problem. The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the rooms have all the usual facilities such as wide screen TV and tea / coffee available. The room we were in was quite noisy being next to a very busy road but unless you are a very light sleeper this shouldn't bother anyone. Bedside lights could do with brighter lamps as reading while in bed is a bit of a strain. The restaurant menu has changed since last year in that I felt we didn't have such a large selection or as good a selection as previous years. The menu is adequate for most tastes. The restaurant has been recently refurbished and is OK. The breakfast menu is very good and is a buffet style which is convenient as this ensures minimum delay. Requests for poached eggs or other items on the menu but not on the buffet is easy and orders can be taken. We were unfortunate to have several adjoining guests who at 1 o'clock in the morning couldn't keep their voices down in the corridor, knocked on each other's door, slammed doors and played loud music. This carried on until 5 o'clock in the morning. This was not the hotels fault but the ignorant and thoughtless attitude of these other guests. I hope they will read this and they will know exactly who they are. We made our complaint to reception in the morning who advised us these people were checking out that day. The hotel apologised and a free drink at the bar was given to us later in the day. This was a nice gesture but our sleep at the end of the day had been spoilt. I say again, it was not the fault of the hotel but some of the guests. Reception, service, bar and restaurant staff were all friendly and very accomodating. Couldn't fault them at all. Would I stay again? I'm not sure? Room rate was quite a lot and the hotel doesn't have a senior citizen rate, even at weekends. This for me is quite a deciding factor when choosing a hotel."
NEUTRAL,"Ithaca New York is not a city of great hotels, so you have to be careful when expecting too much. Most are full of rooms that smell smokey, are old, and not well maintined. Best Western sits squarely in the middle - not bad price and not bad rooms. Pros - friendly staff, breakfast included, spacious rooms. Cons - hotel out of toilet paper!, sheets not fitting on beds and plastic underneath uncomfortable, treadmill kept tripping the circuit and after trying 3 times, I finally gave up. If they would fix the little details, this hotel would be a Very Good. Attention to details is not there right now."
POSITIVE,The room was nice; the bed was comfortable. Cons: Breakfast was awful.
POSITIVE,"A nice hotel with friendly staff, located a few blocks from the ocean, a free continental breakfast, with an easy 40-minute drive to the Rose Bowl. My only complaint dealt with the room key -- it operates like a credit card reader, and the lock had trouble reading my key -- it often took 10 swipes before the door would unlock. The room was stuffyÂ for a while -- we read later that the air conditioning would only turn on after the deadbolt lock was activated."
POSITIVE,"This property was recently renovated and our room was in great shape. Usually ""recently renovated"" means painted, but this really was renovated (they still need to do a little outside work on the stairs). The only downside to the room was the bed squeaked :) The breakfast area was the best we've seen in a long time, included eggs, sausage biscuits & gravy. Everything was very clean. It is located in a high traffic area, but we couldn't hear the road noise inside the room."
NEUTRAL,"Our first night stay was th 11th of Jun and we were not very happy with the indoor pool/spa/fitness center. It was open to the public for 10.00 per day. The pool was packed the entire day with numerous children running wild. The hot tub was VERY hot and since it was open to the public it was very crowded all the time. The sauna was never empty so weÂ did not get a chance to use this. I believe that this should be advertised as the hotel has use of a public facility and not lead you to believe it is part of the hotel. Because of this experience we did not even attempt to use them on our return visit on the 20th of Jun. We had paid reservations or I would have stayed somewhere else on our return . We were looking forward to relaxing at the pool and hot tub and did not get a chance to enjoy it at all. Additionally, when we checked in on the 11th, the person working the counter was very pleasant and helpful. However, on the 20th when we returned the person was very rude and unfriendly. The first room he gave us we had to move out of due to the air conditioner fan. It sounded like a jack hammer. I realize sometimes these things do happen so we did not mind moving to another room. I will say the rooms were clean (except for the carpet, my white socks were black from walking around) and well decorated. The king size bed was comfortable and we had a nice stay in the room. The cable is not very good, but we were only there for one night each time. We stayed there because it is the half way point to our destination, so it worked out well for that."
POSITIVE,We really enjoyed the hotel. The atmosphere was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The kids loved the pool and my husband and I loved the hot tub and sauna. The only thing that was not to hot to us was the breakfast buffet. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't what we expected. But as far as the hotel it's self we will deffinately visit again andÂ also recommend it to others.
NEUTRAL,"Based on other reviews here, we selected this hotel for a short stay for business meetings nearby. The hotel makes an OK impression; it is older, but well kept up. The rooms certainly are clean. The breakfast features waffles, various juices, yogurt, cereals, etc. Quite good for a few days. Two things stick out, however, that make it less than ideal. For one, the bed sheets could not be made of poorer material. Who still uses 200 thread count rough poly/cotton material? Horrible and uncomfortable. Also, the pillows were all thick and unwieldy. Why not have a few thinner or more moldable pillows available? The other issue I had was the way the front desk handled our payment. Without getting into details, they charged my credit card when I specifically said I would use another form of payment, and in the end, they charged me about $50 less than would have been due for the two rooms, stating that it was OK and we shouldn't worry about it. What a strange way of doing accounting. I'm not convinced the auditor will be happy about this. The price seemed a bit high, even with AAA discount, but this is likely driven by the location the hotel is in more than anything else. Anyway, yes, for a shorter stay in the area, and if you're less picky than me, you'll find this to be a nice place to stay."
POSITIVE,Nice stay with good complimentary Breakfast! Nice clean rooms
POSITIVE,"This Best Western in Custer was so welcoming. We were planning on visiting the Flintstone's Bedrock City next door before checking in; however, the park was closed due to inclement weather. We were able to check into the BW early. Our room was very clean. The bathroom, including the vanity, was all in one room and not separate - the way that I prefer. The beds were comfortable, and pillows had enough oomph that my home pillows didn't need to be used. The swimming pool/hot tub are sectioned off in their own indoor area, which was really nice. The pool was chipping a little on the bottom, but the water was a good temp and the hot tub relaxing. My kids enjoyed just getting in the water and watching the rain pelt the windows outside. We drove into Custer for lunch - at Baker's Bakery or something like that. Good food! Dinner was good, but I wouldn't recommend taking tired kids with you. We walked to the Captain's Table just across the parking lot. I would definitely stay here again. Room Tip: Become a BW Rewards member"
POSITIVE,"Very clean hotel, friendly staff, great breakfast, reasonably priced, and conveniently located. Had no problems. Pros: Queen size beds and nice breakfast included, very inexpensive Location: Conveniently located and close to ASU"
POSITIVE,"Although the outside of the hotel is a little scary looking, the inside has been completely remodeled and is very nice."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the BEST WESTERN Crossroads Inn in Schererville, Indiana for 1 Night. Our room was good size and very clean. The breakfast was excellent. The staff was helpful when we needed directions and gave us good places to visit. I slept like a baby. I would send everyone to this hotel, it is a fantastic hotel and I got a good price. I'll return everytime we are in the area. Thanks BEST WESTERN Crossroads Inn."
NEGATIVE,"Although this was an okay place to stay (i.e. no major issues and it's a place to sleep), I wouldn't recommend it overall. First, there's nothing in the area within walking distance (except other hotels), and even the nearest drug store is a confusing 15-minute drive from the location. We chose Bordentown because it was somewhat central to the activities we were planning as a family, and the price was more affordable than staying, say, at a hotel near Sesame Place. We were also attracted by the indoor pool (since May isn't always great for outdoor swimming), the continental breakfast, and the in-room fridge and microwave. Our overall experience, though, left us never wanting to go back to this specific hotel, and never wishing it on anyone else without fair warning. From the time we got there to the time we left (4 days later), the room always seemed damp. The lights and switches didn't always work as expected, and the showerhead was cracked so when my husband tried to adjust it, it fell off. Wifi was horrible in the room with a very weak signal. The curtains were worn and looked ragged when the sun shone through them into the room. Housekeeping actually missed our room on the last day, and with the dampness, we really needed fresh towels every day. The front desk staff always seemed inconvenienced if we made a request, and they need to learn to prioritize between phone calls and people standing right in front of them. So, all the minor things just added up to a poor rating. For an overnight stay, it might be tolerable, but a hotel stay should be more pleasant overall."
POSITIVE,"Recently stayed here again-this time with my toddler-- while visiting family in the area. Clean rooms, quiet, excellent service, and has one of those great atrium style indoor pool areas with arcade games and lots of seating. They offer a free breakfast with your stay--not a continental breakfast-- but a pretty generous breakfast buffet. It is excellently suited for families. Kids can roam a little bit without getting into too much trouble, and adults can relax a bit. Incredibly reasonably priced. This is my go-to hotel in the Wausau area, and I've been heading up to Wausau for almost 30 years! If you're a government employee, they have an excellent government rate. Room Tip: There are rooms that open on to the pool and rooms that do not. The pool area closes by 11p.m., but..."
POSITIVE,We had a 7 a.m. flight from Dallas to CT. We decided to stay overnight then driving 3 hours in the A.M. Best Western offers an airport suttle pus free parking for one week and $3 a day after that. The room and parking fee of $9 was much less them what it would of cost just to park at the airport.
POSITIVE,"Stayed in four hotels during our trip to Canada, this was by far the nicest. Beautiful, cosy spacious room. Really comfortable bed and lovely pillows. Great pool and jacuzzi. Could not fault it at all. Would definately recommend."
NEUTRAL,"If you are passing by Carlsbad, this hotel is not that bad. Its kind of 80ish style, big and this is one problem, the parking lot is very tight, confusing and dangerous because people park their campers or horse tow cars everywhere and that can be hazardous at night (almost hit the hook hitch of one that was left right in the middle of the parking lot, very dangerous because it was at the windshield level). On the other hand rooms are acceptable, need more attention, cleaning and updates but for a one night is OK. The chairs are very dirty and our fridge was very noisy (buzz sound) and we had to unhook it for the night, but the beds and bathroom are clean and comfortable. One important thing that almost made me have second thoughts was upon arrival, lobby smelled like ""pot"" and I think one of their staff members was the cause (don't like to profile but looked like this maintenance person was an ex-con, full of strange tattoos, not friendly and with that loose look like if he had smoked it, but decided to stay because we were tired and had a $50 voucher :) ). One plus, this hotel has a full restaurant and bar that is actually not bad... Room Tip: If you can afford spending $50-60 more, Fairfiled Inn is almost next door besides the walmart and ch..."
POSITIVE,good selection for breakfast
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night during our trip to Sedona; we were in the central part of the hotel. The room was wonderful; we had our own balcony that faced the red rocks and a fountain; the weather was so perfect we could leave the sliding doors open. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable. Breakfast is included and very good; I had my oatmeal with blueberries and a waffle, and my husband raved over his omelet. It was a little pricey but a wonderful experience. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the street."
POSITIVE,"Overall excellent although the room we were assigned to looked directly at a wall with no exterior view whatsoever. We were there for only one night so did not ask for a room change. The hotel wasn't anywhere near full so this room should only be assigned when there are no other choices. Otherwise the hotel is newly remodeled with great beds, refrigerators in the room and verynice bathrooms. Rooms are clean and spacious. Great breakfast in the dining room. Friendly staff. ... Pros: Convenience,room size,excellent beds,free Internet,breakfast. Cons: Room with view of wall and a/c of pool room."
NEGATIVE,Stayed at this hotel on the way to Florida with a few friends and let me tell you this is not the place to stay. Upon pulling up it did not look bad and the front desk service was friendly and very sweet. The Denny's being attached I thought would be a great thing but it wasn't. After paying for the room and driving around there were a ton of older men who seemed to be staying there for construction work around the area which was fine but the men walking around with their cases of beer and hanging out outside and watching you as you walked by was a very unsettling feeling. When we walked up to the room the door was already wide open. We called the front to let them know and looked around to make sure the room was okay. Instead of leaving most of our stuff in the car we had to carry most of it in 'just in case' and adopted the buddy system. In the morning we walked into the Denny's excited over receiving free coupons from the front desk. Apparently this Denny's hates people who stay at the Best Western because after waiting a few minutes when the Denny's was not at all busy we had to grab menus and seat ourselves. Then upon ordering our waitress was not only rude but you could here the workers yelling at each other. Two of us ordered coffee but initially only got one coffee cup. When I asked if I could please get a cup as well thinking she forgot the waitress simply walked away. About 15 min later and after getting our food she finally brought my cup over and said absolutely nothing. If given the option there are a lot of other hotels in this area stay at another one!
POSITIVE,"I am a business traveler and stay at the Seven Seas for a full week every month for the last several years. The Seven Seas is my favorite Hotel. With my frequent stays I am often upgraded to Suites with Hot tubs when available. The rooms are immaculate, bed very comfortable, staff very friendly and the Internet is Superior. They recently did an Internet upgrade and it is amazing how fast the free internet it is. The restaurant and lounge are very economical and the food is excellent. I have recommended this hotel to family, friends and business associates and we all agree that the Seven Seas is the best hotel option in the Mandan/Bismarck area."
POSITIVE,Great that it allowed us to park and fly. Customer service was very good. We inquired about a lost jacket and the staff called at home with the information. The complimentary breakfast had a variety that should please all guests.
POSITIVE,"We were very satisfied with the ease of finding this hotel, right off of the highway. We got a good deal with priceline and had a clean, nice size room with the perks of a small refrigerator and an in room safe. Pros: Nice lobby, comfortable chairs and fireplace."
POSITIVE,"Over here we came in the middle of night with our 4 kids.The staff was very helpful and friendly. They offered us extra blankets and towels for the room which we accepted and appreciated. They even gave us free dinner breakfast in the middle of night. That saved us a lot of money with the children. in the morning time the continental breakfast was very good and appreciated. It was nice to feed everyone right at the hotel for free before we headed out to start the day. The waffles were especially liked by the kids. The indoor pool and hot tub were kept up nicely and clean and had long extended hours for use. Overall, we liked our stay very much and would return. I would say they are Very friendly, helpful, family oriented hotel. They did everything to make us feel comfortable. Enjoyed it a lot. My kids and we thanks them for what they did. Room Tip: The best motel in this area and you will like it"
POSITIVE,"I've stayed here several times over the years and each time my stay has been excellent. The front-desk staff are friendly and helpful, able to address pretty much any need. The rooms are big, clean, and well designed. I need good workspace and the setup is very good, fast internet, easy to access electrical outlets, etc. The hotel location is great - easy highway access, quick to get downtown or to other attractions in the city. A terrific, family owned and operated business."
POSITIVE,Our second stay but not the last one and I will not stay anywhere else in Bismarck. Room is always cleaned well with the smallest details in mind and location is just perfect for everything. This seems to be one of the better ran hotels of Best Western thanks to the helpful staff. One thing that I always check is the cleanliness of the sheets and towels and this hotel always passes the test.
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel with clean rooms, friendly staff. Good breakfast."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Room was huge and clean! Cons: Toilet broke overnight, and hotel management did not offer any discount ."
POSITIVE,"Just returned from a 4 day business trip (Atlanta Gift Mart) and have always stayed at the CNN Omni. Decided to take a chance on here instead because of cost and convenience to the Mart. Just can't praise the staff enough. Thomas, Michael and all the girls at the desk were so gracious and helpful. They really appear to love their jobs. The room was small but very adequate and new. Very clean with an extremely comfortable King bed. Two blocks from the Marta and two blocks to the show couldn't have worked out any better and Max Lager's restaurant across the street was great with unlimited selections of food and drink. Full breakfast is also included and was very good. Like I said...we will be back!"
NEGATIVE,"the motel has become dated and run down. it was once the best place in Carlsbad. it no longer is. it need some TLC badly. the breakfast was just terrible. the bacon was old and inedible, the eggs were cold. the dining area was neglected badly. if things don't improve soon, the Stevens will lose out to the new motels in town and close down."
NEUTRAL,They gave us the worst room because of the price we paid with Booking.com We couldn't get a shower. The room was very smelly. The toilet didn't work and not hot watter.The personnel was very kind . They gave us the worst room because of the price we paid with Booking.com We couldn't get a shower. The room was very smelly. The toilet didn't work and not hot watter.The personnel was very kind .
NEGATIVE,OVERPRICED FOR THE ROOM! Slippery walkways. BUT very beautiful location! Pool not opened when we were there...beds were not too comfortable but were ok for one night. Would not recommend to friends unless the only were concerned with view....
NEGATIVE,"Unhelpful, knowledgeable staff, No breakfast (nor voucher for the restaurant), No business center and in room internet slow and sporadic, Nauseating room smell, Small and inefficient AC, One luggage cart for the whole place and no easy access to room floors. Avoid Room Tip: Bottom floor so can use luggage cart"
POSITIVE,"This is a wonderful hotel - a beach resort in the old-fashioned sense. The building is fairly old, but it has been well refurbished and the location is simply stunning. It is right on the beach - and it is the ONLY hotel on the beach. Good food and great service make this a terrific place. Watch the Pacific roll in over breakfast! Pros: It is right on the beach, and very secluded. Cons: It is also right next to the highway. However, this was not really a problem. Location: Fabulous location right on the ocean. It is about 4 miles from downtown Monterey (you need a car)."
POSITIVE,"Simple, friendly, quick, hot breakfast and great place. I asked about the water/coffee in the room and their exact words were, we expect you to use all the items provided for you in your room, at no additional charge. The breakfast was warm french toast, cheese omelet, bacon, and various pastries, OJ, milk, juices, etc. it was a splendid breakfast! Pros: Hot breakfast, amazing. Cons: Nothing comes to mind."
POSITIVE,the stay was very plesant and the hotel was very accomodating. The breakfast was satisfying and plentiful.
POSITIVE,"MY HUSBAND, AND I ENJOYED OUR HONEYMOON. THE ROOM WAS VERY NICE, THE STAFF WAS FRIENDLY , AND THE ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN...."
POSITIVE,Not bad for the price and location.
POSITIVE,"We needed somewhere close to the airport & this was so close yet we never heard any plane noise. The room was very comfortable, very clean, and the staff extremely helpful. Walmart is next door & meals are within walking distance. Loved it!"
POSITIVE,"Front desk lady was very nice, chatty and friendly. Rooms were very clean new and modern looking with a , "" new smell"". We had an iron fenced balcony that overlooks the strip. Ceilings are high and it still has the old city look and feeling even though it has been updated. Our only complaints would be the noise coming from the street at night with people shouting, car alarms, horns etc...and the wifi didn't work. I could sign in but would get bumped off sites as soon as I tried to navigate through them. It was too late to get it corrected and I have a feeling it couldn't be fixed even if I tried. We only stayed one night and before we heard the noise all night from the street we were planning a return visit. We've stayed in several best western hotels and this one was very nice inside."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, lovely staff, would stay again. Pros: Loved the beds/bedding. I usually get a sore back, but didn't with this mattress. Cons: The breakfast left a lot to be desired - eggs & ham tasted microwaved/rubbery. The waffle was good."
POSITIVE,Good hotel at great price.. excellent check in and check out.. great room. advice: never order king bed on first floor youll get a bathroom with a chair and no tub. that means the whole bathroom gets full of water due to the lack of sliding doors besides bathroom hotel was excellent
POSITIVE,"Pros: Clean, comfortable rooms; and nice breakfast. Cons: Funny smell in room, (cleaning product.)"
POSITIVE,The Woodstock venue is about 15 minutes down the road. The room was spacious but the bathroom was a little cramped. There is a sub/ pizza shop right next door to the hotel. Great Location for going to a concert.
POSITIVE,"Under construction, upgrading. Pros: It has lots of entertainment for the little ones as well as the adults. Cons: It has a ""spot"" that non-guests like to visit, but these people have no consideration for sleeping guests."
POSITIVE,My pregnant daughter &I; were travelling alone so safety was very important. I felt very safe. Clean area - very nice comfortable room. Upgraded from 2 queen to queen junior suite due to the fact that no 2 queens were available when we checked in. We ended up staying 3 nights for the same rate as the original reservation. Very nice staff. A ways northÂ of where we spent alot of time - but worth the drive. We took the ferry our final day across the strait - it was a super trip. Very scenic. I highly recommend this lodging.
POSITIVE,"It is a truck stop in the middle of nowhere, but the rooms are clean and in pretty good shape. I was quite worried that a lot of interstate noise would keep me awake, but it is VERY quiet on the non-road side, and reasonably quiet on the road side. The breakfast has gotten considerably better. Used to stay in Blythe to visit Quartzsite, but it will be Ehrenberg from now until they increase the prices! Room Tip: Ask for a room on the other side from the interstate"
POSITIVE,"Given what I paid, it was a good value. Close to the airport which was how I selected it. Pros: Clean room and bath. Cons: Don't like hotels with exterior corridors."
POSITIVE,"In my opinion this is a great place. Some people are not going to like it because of the location though. It was clean, spacious, quiet. The desk clerks were nice & helpful. The breakfast in the morning was your typical motel fair but good. The parking is the only weird thing. There are not enough spaces so you sometimes have to 'double up' cars in one long space. It was not the end of the world but just know that. Also, the neighborhood is not the highest class but I felt safe there. Just a place with lots of blue collar businesses (garages, mercados, etc.) around it. It's easy to find and easy access to the highway. Treat this nice place as your base camp for exploring LA. It's not a luxury hotel so just get some rest here and get out & explore. Room Tip: Whatever you do ask to be place away from the elevator & breakfast room on the third floor. I di..."
POSITIVE,"Conveniently tucked between several other motels, the Best Western has large truck parking with X-store and Dairy Palace nearby. I thought the best thing was the luxurious bed. OMG, I thought I would melt. Motel is aged, but service staff is excellent."
POSITIVE,"This BW was a very nice surprise. We travelled to Sedona on a romantic getaway and this BW is a resort type hotel with very nice romantic breathtaking views of the rocks. It is worth it to ask for a room with a view of the rocks instead of the city view. We stayed in a king bed room and it was spacious, very nicely decorated, the bed was as comfy as it gets, sheets were nice and clean. The bathroom was a bit too small but nothing that could spoil the stay. The sink is located outside the bath/toilet which helped. The towels are also nicer than the ones you usually find in BW hotels. The free wi fi worked perfectly and it was very fast. The breakfast buffet was another delicious surprise: fresh fruits, nicely display of items, real glasses for juices, nice ambiance and view of the red rocks of Sedona. If it wasn't that cold we could have had a table outside if we wanted. The service throughout the hotel was very good: everybody very attentive and very polite to the guests. The club house was also very nice. We enjoyed every detail and surely will be back to this hotel again. Room Tip: Go for a room view rock views and with a balcony. It is worth it."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is fAbulous. We were so road weary from driving all day. It was a pleasant surprise to check in at a very clean, updated, almost serene room. The beds were so comfortable. Yes, you can stay at one of the chic Inns closer to town, but for money this was awesome!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel during a 10 week odyssey out West and we thought it was great. The views of the red rocks from the balcony was terrific, we even saw a double rainbow one afternoon. The rooms are nice and beds comfortable. As others have said the buffet breakfast was great with something different everyday. Best breakfast buffet on our 10 week trip. My kids also loved the clubhouse activities at the time share villas behind the hotel. The hotel is located in a convenient location and staff was friendly. The owner even offered to help us pack the car on the day we left. We rearranged our trip to stay an extra night and are glad we did. We would recommend this hotel to our friends. Room Tip: Request a balcony room overlooking the Red Rocks"
POSITIVE,"This was our second stay at the Best Western in Bastrop. It's the best hotel there! We felt safe. The decor is a little dated, but they were changing the carpet in every room upon arrival. I'm not sure if they will change out the furniture next. The buffet is an an above average continental buffet. Overall the hotel management seemed to care about the condition/look of the hotel. The front desk is always courteous. We had a gnat problem in our room. We killed about five gnats within the first hour. I honestly attributed it to the fact that the back door was left open for carpet installation. We were offered another room the next morning when I complained...but we did not want to pack up our kids and move. The walls are also kinda thin and you can here walking above the room. And, my daughter found some coins underneath the let-out couch when we let it out. Our room was also missing a shower curtain, but quickly installed once we mentioned it. Overall, we would stay there again. It's close to all the shopping. Don't forget to drive east for about 10 minutes to Mer Rouge and get some yummy ice cream just across the railroad tracks."
POSITIVE,"Friendly helpful staff. Our bedroom was a little cramped and the bathroom had nowhere to hang towells etc., a little tired looking. Tv worked but the channel changer did not."
NEGATIVE,"This place is literally falling apart. The floors are slanted so bad you lean when walking down the halls and in your room! Receptionist allowed another guest to change the name on my reservation without my consent! Never stay with BW. Disliked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,On road trip from SW Florida to New Orleans stopped in Navarre with TA recommendation. Check in efficient but unsmiling. Hotel room standard US Motel complete with noisy air con. However clean and with great view. Hotel has own little man made beach with real beach a few steps below. Also barbecue pit available. Free breakfast ok too. Plus Stinky's Fish place next door is highly recommended. All in all a good choice.
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was ok for the price. The coffee pot did not work properly, but it was a quiet hotel in a safe location. Pros: High-speed Internet. Cons: There was mentioning of continental breakfast, but there was none."
POSITIVE,"Overall it was a good stay, everything was clean and upkempt. Pros: it was convenient to where i needed to be for my stay. Cons: The bed was a little bit too firm for me i like a softer bed."
NEUTRAL,"The rooms were comfortable enough. Usually I didn't hear much noise through the walls, just the hallways. My only real big complain is that their internet service was the worst I've experienced, worse than dial-up. I spent a week in this hotel needing to get online to work, but usually couldn't even get connected well enough to check email. Pros: Clean, quite, and comparably cheap for the area. Cons: Bad internet. Location: Plenty of restaurants within walking distance, other stores just a little further away,"
POSITIVE,"good value nice clean rooms, good breakfast Hotel is close to a water treatment plant and it does not smell to good on hot days outside. Inside ok"
POSITIVE,nice rooms. clean. convenient location to freeway....not too close.
POSITIVE,"Looking for an overnighting place for our last night in Florida, we found this very friendly and pleasant hotel via and with the help of their collegues at another company hotel nearby. Good swimming pool and clean and cosy room with comfortable bed, made our last hotel night one to remember. Friendly and forthcoming service, breakfast not included, but very good and affordable. Room Tip: I only hope all the other rooms are as good as our was, not on the street side."
POSITIVE,This is hotel was great. It was very clean and the staff was very helpful. It is located near numerous restaurants for eating convenience. Great value for the $. We highly recommend.
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed staying here during our stay in Seward. Location is close to downtown so you can walk to several restaurants, bars, shops and Sea Life Center. Very short drive or free shuttle to the marina area or port. Our room was spacious enough with a chair and ottoman. I liked the sliding glass door which let in lots of light and fresh air and small balcony you could step out on. One con to our room.... the sink area was soooooooo small that you could fit very few toiletries. It was, however, separate from the toilet and tub. We had a very comfy king bed with plenty of pillows. It sounds, from the reviews and pictures, that each room is a bit different so if you get one not to your liking just ask to change. The breakfast had make your own waffles, microwave breakfast sandwiches, hard boiled eggs, and standard cereal, toast, bagels, packaged Danishes, bananas, oranges, apples, juices. I know it's Alaska but hotel prices are a bit steep in general."
POSITIVE,We arrived in the middle of the night to staff who were very friendly and went above and beyond for us. Hotel staff came in the next morning to personally drive us to our destination. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Overall great experience. Pros: The hotel staff went above and beyond for us. Very clean and great location. Would stay there again. Cons: Was next to busy highway.
NEUTRAL,"Staff was friendly, but the room initially was not clean so they moved us. They were very helpful in giving us a roll away bed for our little one. The Rooms and hotel really need a remodel and painting. The stairwell was open to the outdoors which made me feel unsafe a bit and we didn't feel comfortable to leave our laptop in the room."
POSITIVE,"We had an unplanned stay here on Monday 25th July due to a delayed flight and arrived near midnight. I would just like to say that the lady who checked us in was very helpful and seemed completely unfazed by the queue of tired customers she had to deal with all by herself alongside the endless phone calls for rooms from people in the same predicament. When I explained that the children hadn't had a meal since lunch time she got some toast and pastries from the kitchen for us. The rooms were nice and clean, although breakfast was a bit sparse the next day - probably because we'd eaten it the night before!"
NEGATIVE,"extremly close to the airport and the rooms where clean and OK for an overnight.. Thats about it. Subaverage as a hotel, but the location made up for it"
POSITIVE,"My sister-in-law and I shared a room with two queen-sized beds. The room was very spacious, with a good-sized closet and nice bathroom. There was a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker, as well as a large desk, in the room. We didn't use the balcony because it was quite windy while we were there. Everything was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the staff was accommodating. There is a happy hour from 5:30-6:30 each evening with free beer, wine and mixed drinks (tips are encouraged). Breakfast was a buffet that included eggs, sausage, pancakes, three cereals, yogurt, bread and bagels for toasting, juices and coffee. The pool, outdoor games, and a lawn are between the hotel building and the beach, though it's still a short walk. The beach is fantastic! A hose is provided at the steps to get the sand off yourself. The restaurant has a good ""early bird"" special though we didn't take advantage of it. We did eat at Trader's the first night. Salads were okay, and my clam strips were probably out of a frozen package; but my s-i-l loved the Manhattan clam chowder and returned for more for lunch the next day. There is a computer in the lobby, where we were able to print boarding passes for our flight home."
POSITIVE,"The rooms are clean the hotel is located near down town, the pool area is nice, bed was comfy and the air conditioning worked great, a bit noisy but i didnt loose any sleep! Cant wait to get back to scottsdale and the sjndial best western!"
NEUTRAL,NICE
NEUTRAL,"Was staying at this hotel for several nights on business; I booked a room with king size bed and microwave/refrigerator. Note you must request a room with a microwave/refrigerator upon check-in and depending on availability, you may or may not get a room with those amenities. The hotel front desk had no information of my requests of those items madeÂ through hotels.com. The entrance-way to the hotel can be a little deceiving at first as the hotel is not located directly adjacent to main the street but a little ways down. Parking space availability can be in short supply when coming back in the evening. Cleanliness and quietness of the hotel is typical for this star-rating type of hotel. One thing that was rather annoying was the the positioning of the AC unit and desk. The AC unit was essentially behind the desk and it was a nuisance to work from the desk if the AC was running because it would get really cold. Perhaps the best part of the hotel is convenient access to surrounding areas/highways."
POSITIVE,"This was during our March Break and the staff made our stay wonderful. Dion especially, he made our trip. I enjoyed the breakfast and it was in a convenient location. The rooms were nice and spacious and I liked the bathroom very much. Cleaner than any other I've experienced! Overall, if I go to NYC again, this is where I'm staying!"
POSITIVE,"Room was a lot bigger than expected, very clean, very comfortable. Will def stay again!!!"
POSITIVE,"Returning to Colorado from Texas, we intended to stay in Dumas or Dalhart but the prices had escalated terribly due to oil/gas exploration in the area and very few rooms were available. Decided to drive to Raton and we were really glad we did. This motel is excellent: new, open, spotlessly clean, and has a great restaurant where they smoke their own meats. Also included in the great price is a free, hot breakfast in the AM. The restaurant and the bar are spacious and attractive and the BBQ and breakfast were delicious. The bed was very comfortable; the TV was a flat-screen LG 42; and the bath was spacious. Our breakfast server was Paula Tafoya and she was especially friendly and professional. This was a great experience and we would stay there again in a heartbeat."
POSITIVE,"We had a quick stay in this hotel again over the weekend. We had to leave before breakfast was officially served. HOWEVER, the breakfast staff was already preparing and was so accommodating to us. This hotel is clean, has easy access to ACU and Interstate 20, and the front desk is helpful."
POSITIVE,"Although this hotel shows some age, it seems to be kept up well. The room was comfortable, and had a good view of the harbor and Morro Rock. The staff recommended a local restaurant to try and it was perfect.I would definitely stay here again! Pros: Close restaurants Quiet"
POSITIVE,"Great deal for what you pay for! The breakfast was great too such a selection! Pros: It was surprisingly really clean! Cons: Wish they also had an outdoor pool, but pleased that they had one at all!"
POSITIVE,"Perfect location for visiting wine country. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast in the mornings was delightful as we're the cookies and milk in the evenings. Hotel was quiet, quaint, and comfortable. Can't think of anything - excellent for the price."
NEGATIVE,"Should have requested a move to another room, but was too tired. When I checked in I turned on the TV and figured it was just the air unit under the window, but I soon realized it was more. The Fridge, which is right at the foot of the bed under the TV was clanking and whining whenever it cycled on. I unplugged it. I then turned off the TV to sleep and the room was still veryloud even after I turned down the fan on the heater. At first I thought it was a vending machine or elevator machine room but I was not near either. It was loudest near the bathroom wall and quieter in the hallway. I then realized that I I was on the top floor and there was something on the roof making this noise. The walls of my bathroom were literally vibrating to the touch. Moral of the story, don't stay on the top floor of this hotel. ... Pros: Good breakfast buffet. Cons: 3rd floor room had very loud noise (from rooftop fan unit I believe)."
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprised at the with the quality of the hotel. Pros: The breakfast exceeded our expectations, a pleasant surprise. Cons: The public seating area near lobby was small."
NEUTRAL,"This was an older hotel that had been somewhat refurbished. It is a decent hotel for the money but not a hotel you would want to go for an extended stay. The pool is very small and not really set up as a resort hotel. The ""fitness"" room was very small with just a couple cardio machines. You have to drive about 4 to 5 miles mies to get to a decent beach. However, it was a decent stop on our way back to Ft. Lauderdale to fly out the next day. Since it was at the end of the vacation, it was more about keeping costs down while staying at a relatively safe place."
POSITIVE,"We stayed the weekend of the Nor'easter. Not their fault there wasn't electricity. They did have a scaled down breakfast, which was really nice of them. They were stressed, because the alarms were going off, something about the water flow alarm. Anyway, the staff was wonderful and did the best they could. I will stay their again and suggest others doÂ also."
POSITIVE,"The room had a nice decor difference to it and while simple, it was quite comfortable. A bit small but good value for the money."
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Avalon Hotel. The staff were friendly, professional and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was a little questionable, however, we felt completely safe there. The hotel was quiet at night. Breakfast bar in the morning was good and the items were very fresh. We spent most of our time in the French Quarter and the drive from the hotel to downtown was an easy drive and not very far away. We would stay there again."
NEUTRAL,"Not many choices if Tully NY is your destination. Hotel is OK, but nothing special. Standard Best Western fair. Beds are hard as a slab of concrete, so if you're used to a foam or sleep number bed, your better bring a foam travel pad to go on top of the mattress. Otherwise, you're gonna have a restless night sleep turning over alot. Toilet didn't flush very well, and always seemed to appear that it was going to overflow, although never did. Hotel staff were very friendly and attentive. Room with 2 queens was just about full between the beds, some furniture, and the rest. WiFi worked well, however every time you shut down your computer and start up later, you have to re-enter the access code to get back on-line. At $93 plus taxes and fees, a little pricey for the area and what they offer, but not horrible."
POSITIVE,Enjoyed our stay. Love Oakhurst and surrounding area including Mariposa. Both areas close to family and friends. Love Judy's Donuts!
POSITIVE,The staff were very friendly and helpful. Great location in regards to the airport and downtown.
POSITIVE,"I chose this hotel because of the outdoor facilities - pool and play area. They looked great for my toddler. Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate, but we had a fun time in the indoor pool."
POSITIVE,The room was very nice with a beautiful view. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I found nothing wrong with the hotel and will definitiely stay there again.
POSITIVE,Nice lodging and good proximity to Yosemite Park entrance =) Good for those who have driven a whole day and can rest the night before tackling the curvy roads leading into the park
POSITIVE,had a wonderful experence there. Frist Adam helped us lug all our luggage upstairs then when we desided to change rooms he happly changed the reservations and helped us lug everything back dwon stairs then when we decided to stay an extra night he got us reregistored. He was great. The pool was fantastic as was the hot tub and the sauna. Had a great time. Adam was very friendly. Thanks for the great stay
POSITIVE,Clean and comfy for our one night in Miami before our cruise. Perfect location between airport and port. Would stay again.
POSITIVE,"Great location if you're in town to see some soccer. A very easy walk to the stadium (across the street). Solves any parking issues for the game. Great beds, very comfy. Pool is kind of small but gets the job done with a decent slide. Our TV was not working but they got it taken care of promptly. I would definately stay here again if I was going to make another trip to the the Sporting KC."
POSITIVE,"I traveled for 28 years for business before retirement. Last week my wife and I stayed at the Tuscan Inn. The rooms were fine, but what makes this facility great is the staff. They are the friendliest, most efficient group I have ever meet. They all seem to like each other and enjoy their job. Each one will go an extra mile to help you. One feels as if they are leaving friends behind when their trip is over. We have gone to many wine receptions at hotels, but none as well attended and enjoyed as much as at The Tuscan Inn. We can't wait to go back to San Francisco and stay at the Tuscan. Room Tip: I would ask for a room up front."
NEUTRAL,Good hotel slightly outdated. Nice breakfast we stayed there on our trip to yosemite. Still more than one and a half hour drive Pros: Breakfast Cons: Slightly outdated Location: Still a long drive from yosemite
POSITIVE,Hotel was very nice & comfortable. Staffs @ front desk were very nice & helpful as well. Had a nice hot/cold breakfast buffet in the morning with nice variety of food items to choose from. Only drawn back was Construction Zone around hotel is a bit confusing...but I wouldn't hesitate to book w/hotel again if ever in the area.
POSITIVE,Lived in Madison for 7 years. Was back for a weekend. Never stayed here. Perfect for the trip...great location. Close to Broach and Genna's. Would Stay again. Go to Genna's and ask for Howard. Madison's best gem!!
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel, very clean and confortable rooms. Good location."
POSITIVE,"Very nice accommodations. Terrific Breakfast. Overall the best you could expect, particularly in that local."
POSITIVE,"Though the hotel is a little older the rooms are very comfortable with modern look; they are also huge rooms. Very comfortable and awesome value. Was not thrilled with the on site restaurant for breakfast. The hotel is close to great area restaurants including Bahama Breeze just a block away, three nights in a row! Room Tip: The bay side rooms looking west are fabulous; looking across the bay and the incredible sunsets!"
POSITIVE,"Certainly not cheap, and counter staff were a bit surely but what can you expect for Lone Pine. Even had a Laptop desk for working while in bed. Breakfast was fine and room was comfortable. I was able to park directly in front of room."
POSITIVE,Nice people working at the hotel but they need to do some updating. Need to get a new van to provide transportation to/from the airport. It broke down on the road while taking me to the airport. This was the third time it had broken down. I was thought I might miss my flight. A nice person that worked at the hotel used his personal van to come get me and take me the rest of the way to the airport.
POSITIVE,"overall it was very good... very close to airport so you can actually hear all planes, if you have light sleep might be a problem. For an overnight stay before taking off it's perfect"
POSITIVE,"WE STAYED ON OUR RETURN TRIP FROM DEPO BAY OR. I HAD SEEN IT ON OUR WAY DOWN TO OREGON. WE HADN'T BOOKED A RETURN PLACE TO STAY. THE EXIT RAMP WAS CLOSED BUT STOPPED AND FOUND OUT TO GET THERE. RESTURANT WAS A 10! GREAT BREAKFAST, GREAT SERVICE 10! THE ONLY THING-NO SMALL TABLE IN THE ROOM, WE PLAY CARDS. I WOULD TELL EVERYONE. GREAT PLACE."
POSITIVE,"My boyfriend and I stayed here one night and it was great! We read reviews and for the price it seemed fair. We were not sure what to expect but we were satisfied. It is a large hotel but it is beautiful and location is prime. We enjoyed the fact that we could walk around Old Town, have drinks and walk right up to our room. The rooms were spacious, very comfy bed! One con and that is the minus star- we were located on a busy area of the hotel so there was a lot of foot action going on."
POSITIVE,"We broke down nearby, and had to spend two nights here. The rooms were very clean, and comfortable. The WiFi as mentioned in other reviews was not the best, but it was there, and in a small town like this where AT&T doesn't even work, WiFi is a welcomed bonus. The staff was very nice. We might plan on staying here next year when we come through again."
POSITIVE,Very nice hotel.steakhouse that is attached was fantastic also.very clean and comfortable.fun little neighborhood with nice architecture.would definitely stay her again when visiting helena
NEUTRAL,"the bed was comfortable and the breakfast was great. It was a little noisy, we could hear the tv from next door and people arguing in the hallway ! it was expensive, although it was the cheapest hotel in that area !"
POSITIVE,"The staff in the 19th Hole are the BEST! Friendly, free breakfast with my room, and GREAT service by the entire restaurant staff. A+++. The door lock on my room did not engage without liftiing the door until it clicked into place. I reported it the first night and although it was a weekend, they did not move me or send someone to fix it. You could justÂ push the door in without the cardkey. Hope that they fixed it for the next guest-I was lucky that I discovered it on my own."
POSITIVE,The hotel is well run in all aspects. Very good breakfast and the rooms are very clean.
POSITIVE,"Very good hotel, but I don't understand why did they refuse to borrow us some beach towels ? Even more, the front desk explained us where to buy them... FYI it's the only hotel in Florida that made us this bad surprise... But the room and the quality of the bed were perfect and very clean. So bring your towels and you will enjoy this nice hotel. AndÂ cheap thannks to a coupon-voucher that we found in a free magazine ""hotels-coupon"". So I recommend it."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel setting, convenient to commercial area yet elevated views made it feel isolated from the commercialism and so close to the real natural beauty surrounding Sedona. Bring your complimentary, full, hot,buffet breakfast from the congested breakfast area to one of the tables on the tiered patios and enjoy that morning view. Room Tip: Request the rooms with the higher view with front parking lot door and rear patio door.opening onto..."
POSITIVE,"For the price, an excellent hotel. Very clean, and convenient to the sights in Baltimore. Would definitely stay again."
NEUTRAL,"I might even stay here again, but apart from the lobby the rooms and halls look a little tired and dated. I thought the rooms were too warm so had to keep the window open and listen to drunk shouting all night (from Granville)."
POSITIVE,Good location . nice staff No restaraunt at hotel .or lounge . breakfast was the same every day.
POSITIVE,Good service. The front desk provided me with a timely Mapquest driving directions print out upon request. Also I liked the bar/restaurant. There was construction on service roads off the highway to the hotel....made access a bit challenging atthe time I was there. Good value.
POSITIVE,"I would suggest anyone travelling to Kansas City, to pick this Hotel, was wonderful :-)"
POSITIVE,I have stayed here for the last two years and have found the facility to be very clean. The staff have been friendly and helpful. The attractions to which I have gone have been easy to reach from this location.
POSITIVE,"I have always had a good experience at Best Westerns, so when I had to make a fast decision I thought this would be my best bet. We got there super late (after midnight) & got right back up at 7am. So as for the pool & area I have no clue. But I can tell you I sleep on a firm mattress but this mattress was horrible! It was hard as a rock, & the sheetsÂ felt like sand paper. But above all that the breakfast was so bad my boyfriend couldn't even stomach the eggs. They were powdered eggs made with water & no amount of salt or pepper could help them. We will not be staying there ever again. For the amount I paid, I expect good quality food & the sheets to be washed in a softener."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is what you expect, its a Best Western. They are not known for great quality but you also will pay the least amount to stay downtown. I've seen alot of bad reviews about this place but it is really not that bad at all. These people who give bad reviews must be used to staying at a Hilton or something because, I had absolutely no complaints about this hotel other thenpaying for parking. The rooms were basic but its all you need when staying for just a couple of days. The breakfast was free and was pretty good (Biscuits and Gravy, Donuts, Danishes, Cereal, Waffles, etc..). It is also located just a couple minutes from all the downtown action of bars and attractions which we walked too and from everyday and night with no troubles what so ever. This hotel really is a great deal if you are looking to stay cheap right down town. ... Pros: Free breakfast, Downtown, and great prices. Cons: Parking was pricey. Rooms fairly small but comfy."
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprised by this motel. It was truly a gem. It had been refurbished and was beautifully furnished. We stayed in a separate building and were able to park directly in front of our room. The beds were very comfortable, the room had a large flat screen TV, and the room was overall outstanding. We tried dinner at the restaurant on the premises. The food was good and the service excellent. The complementary breakfast was also good. To top off everything, the place is pet friendly. This was a great find."
POSITIVE,"this was not a fancy hotel, nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay. The check-in staff were friendly and quick, the hotel rooms were kinda small and the hotel seem pretty old. For its value, this hotel is definitely a great choice for ppl with low budget. Upon arrival, the hotel staff set us in for 2 rooms of me and my friends that r right next each other, plus the two rooms are connected thru a door in the room, making it more convenient for us, travelling as a group. The hotel is very close to universal studios, but around 30 min away from disney. The hotel provide shuttle to sea world and universal studio only! We chose to rent a car instead becuz this hotel also have free parking :) which is great. Overall i recommend this hotel for ppl who r traveling in a group and are low in budgets. Its great for its price and location."
POSITIVE,Die Lage ist perfekt!
POSITIVE,"I'd did like the size of the room, the fridge, the microwave, the LCD HD television, that a window could be opened,the silence at night. The friendly staf en the choice of breakfast."
POSITIVE,"The hot breakfast buffet was very good, and also saved us money because we never had to go to a restaurant for breakfast. Members of the staff were very nice and accommodating. The hotel is not in the historic district, but once we found out we could take the free trolley it wasn't a problem. The staff also called a car for us a couple of times...it is $5 each person. The hotel is not in the historic district, but once we found out we could take the free trolley it wasn't a problem. The staff also called a car for us a couple of times...it is $5 each person."
POSITIVE,"Really surprised how nice this place is. Fountains and statues ouside, contemporary art inside, and a lot of granite. Rooms are very well done, certainly more like a 4-star set up than a 2 or 2.5. Nicest Best Western I've stayed at. Experience was a little dampened by shoddy exercise equipment that rattled and squeaked loudly the whole time used and the owner/manager, a young guy, kept his car parked under the canopy in front of the door so that no one else had room to pull in and unload really. It was there 24 hrs a day and everyone had to walk from the parking lot. However, very nice breakfast selection, including make-your-own waffles, with two different fruit toppings available. And right off of the interstate, but tucked back enough with trees around, so that you didn't hear it at all. Pros: Tastefully done rooms with flat screens and a great breakfast selection. Cons: Service could be better and owner shouldn't keep car in front of the door so that no one can unload there. Location: Felt safe, very close to intersection, but a couple of miles away from all of the happenings."
POSITIVE,"Our room was much better than I expected. Good location with easy drive to everything. Older facility, but clean and room was very nice. Breakfast was the usual that all motels seem to do these days."
POSITIVE,"Very nice motel. Bedrooms were clean and quiet. Pool and spa were great. One of the best continental breakfasts I have had. Service was top notch. Only thing I would suggest is that they might want to add a few more tables in the breakfast area. Sometimes it was standing room only. Pros: The continental breakfast was delicious. Pool and spa worked great and were clean. Second floor room was clean, comfortable and very quiet. Cons: Breakfast area needed more seating. Location: A little hard to figure out how to get to the motel, but was easy once you figured it out."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was wonderful, except for horrible experience with our card keys. We were issued two keys and both were awful. We needed to have them reprogrammed five times over three days. That required a pretty long trek from our 3rd floor room to the office. Maintenance man came up twice to room to check."
POSITIVE,"Again, it would have been nice to move the reservation to another city/time due to am from Texas and went to Lousiana was not able to make for the first night, so i ended up paying for something i did not use. Pros: Its location. Cons: Does not allow to cancel/or move it to the same hotel different city."
POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great place to stay. Very friendly. Comfortable king bed. Large flat screen TV. Pullout sofa bed was great for my kid. She felt like she had her own little area. Right by lots of restaurants and shopping. Liked: Comfortable king bed, large flat screen tv"
POSITIVE,"I liked the personelle, the comfort and the quality of the items served for breakfast. The attendant was excellent in the speed with which she kept a busy place attended. Would hope to stay there again. K Some of the truck noise."
POSITIVE,My wife and I just returned home from a short visit to Philadelphia and we have stayed at this lovely Hotel sveral times prior. We had a very enjoyable stay and the staff was friendly and our room was very good. The room was clean and we had a very restful sleep. We stayed on the Van Gogh Package which was a very good deal which included the room ( nice king size bed-very firm mattress) tickets to the Van Gogh Exhibit at the Art Museum plus breakfast. The restaurant staff was very friendly and the food was fresh and good. I have read other reviews of this hotel and I am not sure what other folks want but this hotel always delivers a clean room with basic good amenities. if travelers want a Four Seasons experience they should stay at that chain which of course is very expensive. My wife and I like the location and the Hotel. Room Tip: ask for a room facing the City Skyline...
POSITIVE,"This hotel is on one of busiest streets of L.A. but is very very quiet and lovable. To Hollywood is a long walk (2/3 miles), i suggest a car or autobus or taxi."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Great staff, good price with the offer accepted. Reasonable for a place to sleep and shower."
POSITIVE,"My Wife and I spent a weekend in Calgary in early March. The front staff at the hotel were really helpful when we asked about the tourist sites. On the first night there was a lot of noise coming from one of the rooms above. That went one for about an hour from 2am to 3am. We asked the next day and the front staff said there were a lot of complaints and the people had checked out. The 2nd night was nice and quiet. The hot breafast buffet was from 6am to 10am and we enjoyed it. Pros: Free Breakfast Buffet was nice and filling. Free underground and above ground parking is good value because other hotels charge extra for those. Location: A bit of a walk to the downtown core, Calgary tower and stampede area. The c-train isn't too far away."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was clean and odor free. The clerk at the desk was efficient, friendly, and responsive. When I walked in with a demagnetized door key, she assessed the situation before I even spoke a word. This hotel has the fastest Internet, I've ever experienced at a hotel. When you consider the lower SC taxes, I paid 1/3 of what my associates paid and I don't feel like I gave upanything practical. There was a good car wash a few blocks away that gave me a FULL wash/dry for $5 along with $0.10 off each gallon of gas for the combo. ... Pros: Fastest wireless Internet I've ever used in a hotel, best desk staff ever. Cons: Lamp was broken with cord exposed, door key demagnetized, no do-not-disturb sign."
POSITIVE,"Overall, my experience here was excellent. The price was great and the accommodations were very clean and well ordered. Pros: Very clean, and very well maintained. Cons: Somewhat hidden behind another hotel. Makes it a little difficult to find."
POSITIVE,very clean nice hotel enjoyed our stay nice get away
POSITIVE,"Better than a 5 Star! Good location for a travel stop from Pgh, Pa to Myrtle Beach. Just amazingly clean and well managed. Room and grounds are a pleasure to the tired travelers eye.. The Truck Stop next door has a good restaurant, with fair prices for alot of food. Also very clean.. If you can find some time go to Mt Airy's little town ""Mayberry RFD"" - a true joy to visit.. Room Tip: No rooms face the Truck stop, so I believe they would all be quite. I am a light sleeper and heard..."
POSITIVE,The beds are very comfortable. Friendly & helpful staff. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet
POSITIVE,"We enjoyed our stay at the best western carowinds during the labor dy weekend. The staff and housekeeping were very thorough and seemed in good spirits as they worked. Jason from the front desk day shift turned us on to a great local eatery that was family owned called Luans. We already have said when we travel we would definitely stay here again. ItÂ was very close to attractons , local eateries and the freeway"
POSITIVE,"The staff were very courteous, friendly and helpful. The breakfast was the best I have ever had in a motel. It was excellent - great choices and variety. I would recommend this motel to my friends and family. I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Good experience. Second time being here. Very nice employees. Helpful with restaurants and where to locate a business when asked. Pros: Liked that they have breakfast, clean but not enough tables in the dining area. Cons: Not enough room at breakfast. Location: Good location, towards the end of town. Quiet."
POSITIVE,"the hotel met all of our qualifications, we really enjoyed our stay and was a perfect stop on our way to St Louis"
POSITIVE,"Older TV; bed too soft; bathroom tissue flimsy. Good location, decent breakfast."
NEUTRAL,In a previous life this was a first generation Hampton it has interior and exterior rooms ...outside and lobby well kept as nice as it was when it was a Hampton ...i stayed on the rear in an exterior room it was very quiet which is great for a day sleeper new colorful paint and nice carpet in room...when first entered had a somewhat funky smell but it wasnt real bad i got used to it quickly...i would give an A+ on the clenliness of the room but a C on the bathroom...room was furnished well bed was as comfy as a hampton...I checked out at 200am there was no hot coffee in the lobby and the lady at the desk seemed a little upset that I had a pastry from the breakfast area before breakfast time...all in all its a descent place price was around $82.00 tax included... I would stay again if in the area...( just have to be careful about taking a pastry before breakfast time officially started) Room Tip: exterior rear rooms are quiet.....
POSITIVE,"I am an event organizer for a number of programs associated with Harvard and the associated teaching hospitals (Brigham and Women's, Children's, etc.) and have been working with the Best Western Inn at Longwood for years. The group sales staff at the hotel have been nothing short of helpful, courteous and amenable over the years as I have contacted them with accommodation requests for guest lodging for groups ranging from just a few rooms to large multi-day and week room blocks. The hotel itself is located in a highly accessible area of the city with proximity to Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Conference Center Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, Best Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Fenway Park, the Museum of Fine Arts and many other Boston landmarks. I recommend the hotel on a regular basis for these reasons and the fact that the property is well maintained, has modern, clean rooms and is in a safe, highly traveled area."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was nice for the money. The view of the water was awesome to wake up to. They have a nice continental breakfast in the lobby in the morning. It is minutes from Navarre Beach. Rooms were basic no frills, but clean."
POSITIVE,We picked this hotel because it had an indoor pool & jacuzzi for after-skiing fun for the kids. Our room was fine and well-kept every day of our 4-night stay. The breakfast choices in the morning were awesome. We would stay here again. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet indoor pool helpful staff
POSITIVE,"The Title pretty much sums it up. We stayed here so we could tour Mt. Rushmore, Chief Crazy Horse, Hot Springs Mammoth Dig and the Needles in Custer State Park. We had a great couple of days and good nights sleep in our room. The motel is a little older but in good repair with an attentive staff. As with a couple other places we stayed, the internet in the room was spotty but strong in the lobby. One note, there is no coffee available in the lobby; this was not the case anywhere else we stayed during our 3 weeks on the road. We were not upset with the lack of a free breakfast because we knew that up front yet we were disappointed in the restaurant that was part of the BW. The breakfast specials sounded good & were good the first morning but the second day they were delivered cold after a long wait; I'd look elsewhere for breakfast. There are no fast food places in this town so a McDonald's breakfast is out of the question. In addition to the above noted attractions, the 1880 Train Co. is located in Downtown Hill City and makes Steam Powered trips a couple of times a day. We didn't have time for this yet we did get some great photos. If you have the time, you may want to do this while you can; there are very few true steam engines still in use. Room Tip: Ask for a Ground Level room when you book, it is nice to unload at your door and not carry ""stu..."
NEUTRAL,"I travelled to NC with my family for a graduation so I did not have time to enjoy the indoor pool. The room was spacious, the bathroom is rather small, and the next morning my light in the bathroom no longer worked and it was hard to adjust the water temperature. Either it was too cold or too hot. Also even though there was a thermostat in the room,Â it was sweltering in there and the refrigerator did not work. Overall for the price that was paid it was not a bad location. Hotel staff was very courteous."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Office lady bobby was a sweet heart, Clean rooms and BIG, They allow dogs i have alot of dogs, I would alway come to stay here love hot tub and pool, Cici"
POSITIVE,The Best Western in Rockville Center is a fantastic location for access to NYC and so many locations on Long Island. We easily walked to the train station and we were in Manhattan in less then 40 minutes-perfect! The General Manager told us about all sorts of fantastic places to eat and drink all within walking distance of the hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable and included a lovely breakfast. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others. Fantastic and helpful staff.
POSITIVE,"Nice, comfortable hotel convenient to the Interstate and shopping.The daily complimentary breakfast offered a good variety of cereals, fresh fruit, eggs, etc..Only negative was the WiFi service in the room was horrible. Connection speed was worse that dial-up. Internet speed on my 3G cell phone was light speeds faster. So, if you are traveling with a teenager that demands to be ""online"" the WiFi in this hotel could be a problem."
NEUTRAL,"If you intend to visit World of Coca cola, CNN center och HardRock Cafe"
NEUTRAL,"Cheap hotel small rooms, industrial location bad break fast"
POSITIVE,i really couldn't wait to write a review for this hotel. We were in Plymouth for a wedding and only had a small selection of hotels to choose from. I noticed positive reviews for this hotel so we went with it hoping that the reviews were accurate. And were they ever! This hotel did not disappoint. The rooms were large with a sink and a separate vanityÂ and were immaculate and well stocked. The manager at the front desk was cheerful and so helpful with maps and how to get around the town. The grounds were well kept up. I would absolutely recommend your stay at this hotel.
NEUTRAL,"rooms were really old and i'm not sure if it was my allergies or dirt, but had horrible sneezing attacks- the big plus of thisplace is location- lotsof little stores andshops in the surrounding area"
POSITIVE,"Great location. Staff worked well with our needs. Our remote to the TV did not work, however, they were able to work out a deal when we checked out. The stay overall was very pleasing. Pros: Clean and comfortable Cons: Remote did not work Location: Close to downtown and the beach"
POSITIVE,The beds were very comfortable and I needed a good night sleep after traveling for about 10 hours. I slept well and very comfortably. Rooms were very clean and my first night I even had an executive suite. Very nice! I was able to rejuvenate and I stayed one more night.
NEUTRAL,"We saw all the sights in Boston! Great trip! The hotel was so-so. Toilet didnt work every time...towels were ripped...our floor had an odor one night...breakfast line was long, and nothing special... There was a great seafood restaurant next doorto the hotel."
POSITIVE,Very pleased with everything.
POSITIVE,We stayed overnight before going to the airport. It was convenient & comfortable. We were given an upgrade. Staff were pleasant. Shuttle to airport was on time &. Efficient.
NEUTRAL,"We reserved at this hotel mainly because of the facilities, I.E. it had a work out room and sauna. We were travelling and had an overnight in T.O. The hotel was described as being close to the airport. The fitness centre was like a fish bowl, it is located on the main floor in the lobby. We realize for a lot of people, they are not uncomfortable by people being able to watch them exercise, but for us that is not the case, so we did not use the facility. We were also disappointed with the food in the restaurant in the hotel. The shuttle service you have to call for from the airport, we had a little more than a half hour wait for it. We would book in a hotel closer to the airport next time."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has convenient parking on site. The breakfast cafe was well stocked and the attendant was friendly and courteous. There were 3 waffle makers which added to the usual toast, buns & cereal and was a pleasant surprise. The desk staff were friendly and checkin was quick. The beds were firm and there were plenty of towels.The only negative was that the air conditioning seemed to be either on or off and seems to be a retro-fit into the old heating system. The TV was old and a TV guide would have added to the viewing since there was only a slowly rotating guide channel on this cable instead of an interactive guide as is on satellite TV.Overall we found this a great value for our money and will definitely be back again."
POSITIVE,Love the sitting area and the refridge. Very comfortable room. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet
POSITIVE,I thought that it was a nice hotel for the value and the rooms were quite spacious. The only negative part was the location since it is necessary to have a car to downtown Miami.
NEUTRAL,"Our family had 5 rooms and 18 people, and overall this is a decent hotel. The rooms are decent and clean, the staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was good, just wished they had some bacon or sausage and maybe eggs, but we didn't go hungry. The accessibility to the beach and the view were awesome. ...However there are some down sides too. We had a family member who uses a power chair and does not get around well. She had trouble especially in the pool area. There are 7 steps going up into the pool area and the pool has no steps going into the pool and the ladder was in the middle area of the pool, not in the shallow end, and one step was loose. This made it difficult for those with limited mobility as well as going with small children. We would have to get in the pool and have someone hand the child to us. We also were concerned about the width of the balcony rails. We didn't let our 1 yr old on the balcony, and were cautious with another child of small build. I would stay here again depending on who we were traveling with, but I just wanted people to be aware of the downfalls."
POSITIVE,Stayed there for three nights on a recent business trip. My room wasn't ready yet so they immediately upgraded me to a suite. Room was very nice two rooms and the bed was really comfortable. Room was very clean.The hot breakfast was great. I definitely would stay there again.
NEGATIVE,"Stayed at the Chequamegon Hotel thinking that it was as Grand as its exterior. Not so. Hairs found in room. Bar not open until the time we were advised it would be...the staff was closing the bar just as we arrived; opening was non-negotiable...not even for a beer...which is just plain stupid from a business perspective. Breakfast was unattended and messy. Arrived in Breakfast Room at 9am and every table was a mess. None of the breakfast choices were properly stocked. Guests were looking through cabinets and drawers for food and silverware. To top it off, an employee walked through the Breakfast area, right by the mess - including the cabinets and drawers that were wide open - and went directly into her office! We stayed in Breakfast area til 10a (the end of breakfast) and not a single person came in to check on the area for the last hour. The only saving grace was Carrie at the Front Desk. Outstanding employee, carefully listened to my issues and provided a discount. She's the only person I encountered that was helpful. Unfortunately, we will not return to this hotel...the AmericInn is out of the question as well...it's kiddie central because of its ""micro-waterpark"". We love the Ashland/Washburn/Bayfield area and we will return. We just have to find find another hotel. Room Tip: Do yourself a favor, save your money and go to another hotel for a room."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel three times now and it has been a pleasant experience every time. The Sandcastle is by no means a 5 star hotel, but it is fabulous for the price of the rooms and the locations. The indoor pool is great if you are heading in off season, the parking is very convenient and the rooms are clean and comfortable. ThisÂ past time I was a pesky customer and they were very understanding. When we booked through Hotels.com, there were only double queen rooms and so when I checked in I requested a king room and was switched with ho hassle. Then that night it rained and our room happened to be under a low point in the roof so there was a waterfall coming over the balcony. They were very understanding and switched us again for the rest of our stay. We also LOVE the Greek restaurant downstairs! Their continental breakfast room also offers fresh hot Belgium waffles, which are always nice. Right now they are in the process of renovating, but they were doing a fine job of not making it an inconvenience. Overall it is a great place to stay on a budget when you really want all the amenities."
NEGATIVE,"This is an excellent facility, and several of the staff and van drivers were excellent. The location is also convenient to the airport, and not too far from downtown. However, we checked in around 10:00 p.m. to find that the only restaurant on site was closing, and only vending machine products were available. In addition, the evening front desk clerkÂ needs training."
POSITIVE,"This is my second visit and thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff, food and bedrooms all excellent and I would recommend to anyone"
POSITIVE,Very clean and beautiful room. Wonderful experience. The bed was very comfortable. Nothing to complain about.
NEUTRAL,"The room was stuffy. Could not feel any air circulation. There was no way to keep the fan on and the air conditioner cycling at the same time. Could use a fresh coat of paint. The people were very nice and very busy. Over all it was much less than we usually find with this chain. Pros: Price, location, breakfast. Cons: Stuffy, noisy Location: Easy off and easy on the interstate"
NEUTRAL,"The Hotel was good the walls are too thin, I could not sleep because you could hear your neighbors talking in the Hall. The refrigerator made a lot of noise though out the night, so every time it came on I woke up. However the staff was friendlyand the room were clean and comfortable."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. This is an older hotel but unless you already knew this you would never know. Smells fresh, looks fresh. Clean and well kept all the way to the gardening. Great place to stay."
NEGATIVE,First this is NOT a hotel it is a MOTOR LODGE!!!!! UGH it smelled like cheap perfume & the room smelled even worse like a bad car freshener. We almost left but it was so far off our path (because they make it look worth it) that we stayed. People walking around looke questionable as well. The restaurant next door had good food though. The pool area was nice & kept clean so that was all it was worth but we had to check out by 11am which most places give until noon. It was a really cheesy Motor Lodge!!!!!! Pros: pool Cons: EVERYTHING ELSE _ THE ROOM SMELLED SO BAD MY EYES WATERED ALL NIGHT & MY SON WAS SO STUFFED UP FROM WHATEVER WAS BREEDING IN THAT ROOM! Location: Right off the road but not our highway!!
NEUTRAL,"Not a *bad* hotel at all. Just doesn't get full marks because of a couple particulars. The toilet paper holder was not perfectly attached to the bathroom counter edge, for instance - kind of half hanging off though you could tell they'd tried a few times to readhere it. or the elevator, that sometimes decided to open and then immediately shut again before you could get on. That kind of thing - no particular fault of the staff, just the hotel itself isn't perfect.The couple staff members we dealt with were pleasant, though nobody knew what I was talking about when I said Expedia offered an ""Expedia extras"" coupon package for nearby shops and restaurants.Only things I hated were the pillows (same overfluffy head-swallowing things that every hotel seems to have lately) and the raucous party in a nearby room when I had to wake up for an 8 hour drive home the next day.If you want the continental breakfast in the morning, by the way, get there within the timeframe noted; they yank the bagels and cereals and such at 1030 *sharp*. We thought that was amusing; one guest had to chase the guy down to ask if she could grab a spoon as he whisked the flatware away. Pros: Front desk clerk was very nice; even offered printed directions to Brandeis, where the person we were visiting was located. Cons: Pillows. Location: JUST off the highway, a few miles from Brandeis University. Not a tourism/shopping area at all, but not a big deal for our purposes."
POSITIVE,Stayed here while on a shopping trip. The staff was more than helpful with all requests. Breakfast was good. Room was very comfortable. I would stay here again
NEGATIVE,"My family of 5 booked 2 rooms for 4 nights at this hotel due to its proximity to Disneyland and to the LAX airport. upon checking in at around 8 pm, there was only one hotel staff and she was multi tasking, taking a call while handling our check in and answering queries from another hotel guest. Boy was she stressed out but didnt show it. Upon entering the room, what immediately caught our attention was the stained carpeting, my wife spent all the lysol disinfectant spray that she brought on the two rooms. The rooms are furnished with sofa, ref, iron with board and microwave; the cleaning staff handled the day to day cleaning really well. What annoyed us were the poor soundproofing, you could hear people talking on the other room; you could hear muffled footsteps from the room above us and running water from showers from adjoining rooms. If youi are a light sleeper, you wouldnt be able to sleep soundly at anytime of the day. Its so poorly insulated that even people walking on the corridor could be heard and vibrations felt. Also noise coming in from the parking could be heard especially those irritating alarms going off in the middle of the night. The location is centrally located with food and mall outlets within 30 minute walk but its better to do it during daytime, although it is in a safe neighborhood, the streets are desserted at night. I suggest to the owners to totally gut this place down and construct an all concrete structure with good soundproofing. Im sure they will be able to recoup their investments fast since the place is in a very good location. Room Tip: if you cant avoid this hotel, choose the 3rd floor rooms and away from the road."
POSITIVE,"Pleasant surprise! I had a 2-day business seminar in the downtown area and did not want to pay the otherwise exorbitant prices at other downtown hotels in the area. This hotel turned out to be a great find with a very reasonable 5 block walk to my meeting destination. Daily parking was more than half the rate of other hotels in this area. Pros: Newly updated rooms and bathrooms, very clean, friendly staff. Cons: May be a little noisy for light sleepers, poor WiFi connection, microwave/fridge only available with room upgrade."
NEUTRAL,"The room was very clean, no bad odor. The location is noisy, but there is no reasonably priced hotel that is not close to I-75, which is very noisy with traffic speeding by 24 hours a day. Other than that this is a good location. If you are completely exhausted the freeway noise probably won't bother you. My complaint about this hotel is the laundry room. Filthy! I took a clorox wipe to the top of the clothes dryer and it was so dirty I could not get it clean. All they need to do is clean the laundry every couple of weeks, clean the tops of the machines and sweep the floor. I know you think that no one uses the laundry room, but that is not true --if it were a bit cleaner more people might use it. I had to look for a laundro-mat in town."
POSITIVE,"We had a nice stay at the Eden Resort. We have stayed there many times over the years (our son lives nearby). However, this is the first time that we discovered the exercise room which we made good use of (helped to burn off some of the calories that we put on dining in the great restaurant. Too bad the weather wasn't a little warmer. We would liked to have tried the outdoor pool. This reminds me that our son is a member of Eden's pool club and his family makes great use of it. Here are a few observations that I can share with you: food is great and fair priced. Maid service is really thorough. like the free Wi-Fi service. the only room safe that I have found that is large enough to hold a laptop computer ....major Koo-dos. close in parking at night is hard to find (certainly is a busy facility). Friendly staff... everyone says hello or good morning... even the grounds keeper and the outdoor electrician. The best alarm clock.... in big letters it lets you know that the alarm is not set. (How many times have I been awakened in the middle of the night in some hotel because the previous guest set the alarm and didn't turn it off. You might think that some of the above are small things. However, one week later I am still thinking about them. Thanks for running a good Hotel/motel. Room Tip: There are many price levels to choose from."
POSITIVE,"I just got back from staying for four nights at the Best Western Inn of Sedona. We had a room on the top level with lovely views. The room was very clean (my most important requirement), the bed and pillows were very comfortable, (one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel). The room was quiet and had everything we needed. The staff could not have been nicer, both over the phone before our visit and during our stay. The breakfast was a nice bonus. I definitely will stay here again next time I'm in Sedona. Room Tip: The rooms on the top floor (level three) have wonderful views and are also on the same level as the..."
NEUTRAL,"I give this hotel 3-stars because of the view, the staff and the location. My family and I came here for Memorial Day weekend and my grandmothers 70th birthday. Complimentary valet was nice with 2-3 guys waiting at all times. (one guy is scared of dogs so dont ask him to help with your luggage if you have a dog with you)The hotel itself is located in prime location and thankfully we got an AMAZING view with a balcony to experience the waves at night and throughout the day. Upon check-in everyone was an asbolute delight. Everyone was extremely sweet and friendly. The room itself is TINY, like ""don't turn around too quickly you might hurt yourself"" tiny but comfortable. The bathroom was so small you barely could close the door while brushing your teeth. We brought our dog Sofia as this is a pet-friendly hotel so it was nice to see dogs with their families. The pet-frienly floor is on the 3rd floor and surprisingly our room didn't smell of dog or anything. Our maid was a bit ""lazy"" and by that i mean she cleaned our room once out of the 4-day stay, each day with a new excuse as to why she couldnt clean up. Whatever, we had too much fun to complain. There are two pool sections, one is on the side and is a bit more of a relazed ambience with the bar and a shallow portion of the pool for families with kids. But dont bother wasting your time getting a drink, we sat for about 30 minutes waiting for the bartender to acknowledge us. She was rude and obviously had other things on her mind rather than working. We had breakfast at the ""Aqua Vi Lounge"" and you can either pay $12 for buffet (which sucked) or 10 for a cheese omelet. VERY expensive - $50 breakfast for 2. Not worth it. Overall, i cant say that this would be my number one choice for virginia beach but of course having my dog with me left me limited choices. Ocean Beach Club and the Hilton down the street looked absolutely amazing."
POSITIVE,For a beach hotel it was very clean and modern. The staff at the desk were wonderful and cheery. The only reason I didn't score a 5 on service was that they didn't come by to clean the room until 5pm. It's only an inconvenience and in fairness they do state that it may not be completed until 5.
POSITIVE,The hotel was very nice overall. access to the beach was incredible. wish the pool was beach side not beside the parking lot! the hallways were extremely hot. the ice machines were falling apart and the bathrooms could use a little soap scum remover! the room itself was clean and very comfortable. the staff when passed in the hallways were not veryÂ friendly but i dont think i would be either if i was cleaning up after people on vacation all day. other than those few things i was pleased with our stay.
POSITIVE,"I am so happy that we decided to stay here for my 50th birthday! I had read the mixed reviews, but something in my gut told me everything would be great! Every single person that we came in contact with over the 5 nights we stayed was awesome! People actually went out of their way to say hello and ask how we were. Our room was clean and well appointed. Our housekeeper personally asked us everyday if there was anything we needed. Every morning we woke to the sun rising and dolphins swimming playfully (as if ordered for our pleasure!) We were on the 18th floor and absolutely never had a problem waiting for elevators...in fact most times an elevator was waiting with the door open! Parking was never an issue - I attended a conference in the area so I was in and out a lot. The beach was incredible! And I really enjoyed the fact that the hotel was not in the center of the hub bub, but it was close enough if you wanted to go there. I would have written this sooner, but first there was the earthquake, and then Hurricane Irene blew up the east coast. We pray that the Wyndham Va. Bch and personnel were all safe during these events! We can't wait to return next year!"
POSITIVE,"It was a very special and a memorable trip. I was there to celebrate my friend's birthday and all arrangements and some surprises were planned by the night manager at the hotel. She went out of the way and stayed back till late to plan things. To make the birthday more special, we also had complimentary breakfast. It was a very homely experience and we loved it. Room Tip: book in advance"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for our first family vacation with our infant (14 month old). 4 nights. We found the hotel to have exactly what we needed. There were several staff members who helped make our stay enjoyable. Samantha stands out from the bunch for proactively giving us an extra blanket and towels. We loved the pool and hot tub and the great breakfasts and having a kitchen in our room made it much easier to vacation with our baby. Pros: Good free breakfasts with waffles and variety of other options. Pet friendly. Full kitchens in some suites. Excellent staff. Cons: Wifi was spotty in our room, a bummer. Pioneer TV's had many inputs (including VGA), but for some reason it wouldn't display a video running off of my laptop, OH WELL. Room Tip: All rooms are oceanfront suites. The hotel is pet friendly. Free breakfast is great early in the m..."
POSITIVE,Great room with everything you need within the hotel. Hotel is central to everything and has fantastic ocean views. The pools will not disappoint!!!!
POSITIVE,"I was born and raised in Va. Beach and got to see a whole new perspective of the area from the VA. Beach Oceanfront Hilton when my husband and stayed there for the two days after our wedding. I have to say the hilton is clean and fresh for an oceanfront hotel, but there are two reasons to stay there. The first is the rooftop pool and late night sky bar. Like I said, I'm a local, but I have never seen Va. Beach from such a beautiful perpective as from that rooftop. It felt like being swept away to a whole new place. Not to mention the infinity pool. My whole wedding party was given special treatment at the sky bar after the wedding. They were great to us and we were not married at the Hilton. The second reason is Catch 31. I've eaten there many times at a local, but getting to get up and have the buffet was a special treat. The food is fantastic. The location is perfect (farther down the strip so it isn't so busy). The hotel isn't cheap. I recommend an off peak stay if you're on a budget, but we had a wonderful experience there. Room Tip: Get a room on a high floor and spending the extra for ocean front is worth it. We woke up to dolphi..."
POSITIVE,"I don't usually stay in Best Westerns, however this was a very nice stay. The room was nicely decorated and modern. The bed and pillows were fine. The room was clean except for stickiness on the bathroom floor. The breakfast was ok, I was looking forward to the biscuits and gravy, however there weren't any, so I am not sure if this is just a weekend option or not. I did have a complimentary water and snack waiting in the room for me. The internet was slow at times and dropped a connection, but fine for what I needed to do for work. The TV reception kept dropping out occasionally as well, so not sure the cause of that. I would recommend this hotel over the other options for your next visit to the area."
POSITIVE,"Took our son to Cooperstown for his bday. Wasn't quite sure what to expect. I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was immaculate, the beds were really comfortable, the room was big and the employees were very nice."
NEUTRAL,I booked this room as a king size room. We were told there were no king size rooms available upon arrival so were give a double at the same price. Had some problems with the tv and found a roach We usually stay here when we do weekend escapes since we love the Sarasota area but we fdoing the booking this first time wth booking.com I was very disapointed being told there were no king size rooms when the web site said there was.
NEGATIVE,"The hallways smelled of cigarettes and stale beer. The TV channel would not go above 22. When I called the front desk the girl who answered acted like I was bothering her. She did not get anyone to fix the TV, all she said was she would leave a note for her manager. Horrible Service Pros: Bartender was very friendly and attentive Cons: Front Desk staff were indifferent and rude Location: na"
POSITIVE,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel, and its not because I don't like it but I always look at price and amenities when ever I'm searching for a hotel. Best Western Jamaica Inn had the best price for my last trip, and even though other hotels had similar prices I knew of the quality of BWJI from my pass experience. One of my main amenity is the complimentary parking that BWJI offers. The check in clerk was very quick and courteous, I think I was checked in in less than a minute. So I would gladly return to that hotel Pros: Free onsite self-parking, Located right off of a main highway. Cons: The checkout time. Most hotels check out is 12 noon, BWJI check out is 11AM Location: Great location if you have to get to the airport in a hurry. Its right off of Van Wyck Expwy which takes you straight to JFK."
POSITIVE,"Tried this out since Best Western we used to stay in down the hwy is no longer. This hotel is far superior to most in Best Western chain. They've done a really nice job with the rooms and decor - the overall furnishings look like something in a much pricier hotel. It's being kept up well, very clean and good service. I will agree with a previous reviewer regarding thin walls - we could hear neighbors in next room very well. If you're in the Valley and need a place to stay, you can't go wrong with this Best Western."
NEGATIVE,"They should conduct a background d check on employees who work there because it is unacceptable for any clients not to recover any items left in the room just few hours after the check out. That is the first time that such a thing ever happen to me. Pros: The staff was friendly. But when I complain about my suit that I left in the room, I did not received a positive feedback to get my stuff back. Cons: I had a bad experience because I lost my item there."
POSITIVE,"They were remodeling in the lobby when we arrived. No problem, it did not stop service. The room was freezing. Even with a/c turned off. Pros: Clean Cons: Cold Location: Close to the airport. Nice"
POSITIVE,"We were taking a long trip and needed somewhere to crash to finish the trip on the nest day. We used Tripadvisor to help us find this jewel. The motel was very clean including the sheets. The free breakfast was very good. The motel was safe because you needed to scan your room key to get in the building. The motel wasn't very far from the interstate but I couldn't hear traffic while I was going to sleep. If you look up ""Southern Hospitality"" in the dictionary you might see this place. The girl at the front desk was very nice and helpful and the lady that worked in the breakfast area was really nice and friendly as well. I would highly recommend this motel and if I'm in the area again, I will stay here!"
POSITIVE,"Nicely located in North Bay. Rooms very clean. Beds and linens tops. Staff very friendly. Nice restaurant Farina on premises, Bar nice. Staff very friendly. Pros: Beds & Linens. Restaurant & Bar. Cons: Hallways Location: 300 Lakeshore Drive, North Bay On"
NEUTRAL,This hotel was one of the most expensive I stayed at on a recent road trip. There is really nothing special about the property. I got better value at other hotels on the trip. The breakfast is what you'd expect at this price level. The rooms are a bit on the dark side. The hotel is pet friendly so you have to take pet noises into account. I stayed on the ground floor near the back entrance and there was considerable traffic with people taking their pets out the back. The hotel is a bit off the main streets so you have to hunt for it. The front desk staff was quite helpful. Room Tip: Stay away from the ground floor rooms near the back if pet traffic bothers you.
POSITIVE,We stayed here for a baseball tournament and it was a very decent hotel with lots of restaurants nearby. We also went to private school across street and walked on the track. Breakfast was so- so... Staff was very nice!!
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is very conveniently located near the highway, but keep in mind you will need a car to go out for a drink or a bite to eat, especially at dark (the roadsides are unsafe for walking). Staff was not particularly friendly, breakfast is very unimpressive (if I would have eaten the entire donut I'd still be chewing on it now, 5 weeks later). The room was large but had an unpleasant, musty smell to it. Would not return."
POSITIVE,Room clean and comfortable. Decor: generic. Pool and exercise room pleasant. Staff pleasant Free Breakfast better than generic
POSITIVE,"Cold Spring is very comfortable, clean, pleasant and well maintained. The staff is very friendly. We truly enjoyed every aspect of our stay."
NEGATIVE,"Then the first room given to us would be appropriate. Probably 50 flies already in the room - on the ceiling, buzzing around the main room, in the bathroom for starters. Fresh cigarette burns on the sheets and a nice smoky smell wafting through the room completed the experience. Eventually after significant complaining we were moved to a different (andÂ slightly better room), after first being told the entire motel was sold out. I'm not sure what deck of cards the owners of the motel are playing with, but it's not one we were used to."
POSITIVE,"This place is great!! Friendliest staff I've ever met. Handy to every downtown attraction. Next to Space Needle. Close to Pikes Place. Updated Rooms have great beds with good TV, microwave and fridge. Very clean. Great breakfast. Right next to Hurricane Cafe which is open 24 hours. Only downside-- since a little bit older the insulation between floors makes for some noise. But the good outweighs the one negative. Ask for Managers Specials for additional discount. Great value for this area."
POSITIVE,"We were pleased with our stay. Our room was very clean. It was nice to have a coffee bar open 24 hours. The pool was nice. The only downside was both their wireless networks were down while we were there. It was a great value for the area. Pros: 24 hour coffee, juice, and hot cocoa. Cons: Wireless was down Location: Close to everything but in a quite area."
POSITIVE,"Spent Oct 11 and 12 at the Blue Iguana with our small dog. Roon 104 with an enclosed patio was perfect. The entire property is outstanding, well kept and a great staff. Tara worked hard to handle a number of special requests. We have also stayed at the Emerald Iguana which is closer to town but does not take pets. Both properties are great. For the golfer forget the Ojai Inn and go to Soele Park, muni, best $35.00 golf in CA. Will return in the spring. Room Tip: the property is close to road so ask for rooms on the back side of the property"
POSITIVE,"Nice clean rooms, and a couple very friendly very helpful women that work the front desk. Nice flat screen LCD to plug my laptop into as well. By far the most bang for your buck in the area. Room Tip: All of them I have stayed in have been nice."
POSITIVE,"This place has a gym , pool, hot tub-much more than just a place to sleep for 8 hours before your next flight."
POSITIVE,"Great room (though we had a 'room' vs a 'suite') - comfortable, clean, quiet, good breakfast, King size bed, smoke free - everything we needed. Staff was fine. Only improvement would be an auto-opening door versus a swinging door at the front entrance. Well, that and a sink outside the shower/bathroom would be nice... Otherwise, perfect! Ruby Tuesday within walking distance but not many other restaurants close by. Fast (hard-wired only) internet."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this Comfort Suites over the weekend for the Alabama-Florida football game. The hotel is especially nice, staff was friendly and helpful. The ladies at the breakfast area were super nice. The breakfast bar had plenty of items to choose from and was well stocked. Thanks for a really nice stay."
POSITIVE,"For our short stay it was comfortable and the price was good for a better than average hotel. Breakfast was good with a lot of choices and well stocked. All the staff were friendly and the facilities were clean. The pool was nothing to rave about except to cool off but the water was warm actually. The temperature in the hotel was warm and gave it a bit of a stuffy feeling. HotFlorida days require cool indoors. ... Pros: It was comfortable, clean, friendly and offered a well stocked breakfast. Cons: The air-conditioning didn't work real good or was keep at a higher temperature than comfortable. Gave a stuffy feeling."
NEGATIVE,"Very deplorable condition inside and outside of the hotel. Needs a better maintenance all the way around. Good location, just a few minutes from the historic site."
NEGATIVE,"It's not the first time that i got an Holiday Inn Express with Priceline, but this time I really feel that I was staying in the cheapest room. When asked for an up stair room, reception staff told me that I asked for a regular room, and I think that she really means a Priceline room. Cons: Reception staff and the ugilyest room I ever got."
POSITIVE,"The motorcycle rally is so spread out that this centrally located hotel proved to be convenient. The employees are all pleasant and helpful, and Biker freindly too. It is located on a six lane road, so traffic was not a problem, Close to I95 which is a plus."
POSITIVE,"Well my family and I had a very good experience at the hotel, the breakfast was great...the service was impeccable. And there was one person that stuck in my mind a front desk clerk name Angela she was very helpful with directions and getting us checked in very quickly she is a great asset to your company. House keeping was also wonderful i will recommend this hotel to family and friends."
POSITIVE,Got it because it is close to the race track and the price was decent. Staff very courteous and friendly.
POSITIVE,We were very comfortable at this room and it was great for the price. We planned on camping but the weather had other ideas so it was a last minute planned thing. The room was comfortable but the area that the hotel was located didn't seem like the best place to walk around by yourself at night. If you are just looking for a place to stay for a nightÂ or two this would be it.
NEGATIVE,AVOID them - Dishonest and shady business practices.
POSITIVE,"Not enough parking spaces. No leaving car there, especially when flying out. Pros: location Cons: no where to park, can't leave car when flying out."
NEGATIVE,Nothing worse then having to pay a resort fee that was more then half the room cost!!!
POSITIVE,Hotel had everything. middle of the strip. nice pools. good and fast service. And all for a great price.
POSITIVE,PROS: -LATE CHECK OUT -EARLY CHECK IN -CLEAN -CLOSE TO MGM -24 HOUR STARBUCKS -QUIET CONS: -FAR FROM FASHION SHOW MALL -NO WIRELESS INTERNET -LONG WAIT TIME FOR FRONT DESK
NEGATIVE,"I booke my room on hotels.com, was given a good rate. When I got to Vegas and checked in at Excaliber they gave me a ""complimentary"" breakfast voucher for 40 bucks to the buffet(which is disgusting btw). That night I looked at my bank acct online and saw numerous charges. One of which was the fee for the FREE buffet from excaliber hotel. What? AnotherÂ was for a full nights charge. What is this? Upon checkout I disputed it. I got charged for the buffet then for a daily rate until checking out.. I PREPAID IN ADVANCE!!! I had 3 overdrafts. After 6 hrs of insufficient funds it was resolved. They gave me a free buffet for my troubles, WHICH WAS AGAIN CHARGED TO MY ACCT. DONT STAY AT THIS PLACE. ITS A JOKE..."
POSITIVE,Great hotel and great location. I had problems with some noise on the roof because it was very windy in these days. it was like that somebody will shutting down the windows or doors all the time. when i made a call quite lately at night at around 23.30 they offered me immediately that they can move me to another room and i did not even ask for that.Â they moved me in 5 minutes and even upgraded me. stuff are really pleasant and helpful. i just missed the wi-fi because it is easier to do be online on wi-fi instead of cable. but cable is enough long to have it to your laptop on your bad as well. definitely will stay there if I come again.
NEUTRAL,The room is clean.The air conditioner more noise.
POSITIVE,"While our first night was a little disappointing and the highest rate, the rest of the vacation was great. Low rates and clean, quiet room. The pool was nice, but it was a little chilly to go swimming. The important thing for us was to stay on the strip since we would not be renting a car. All of the staff were polite and we didnt have any problemsÂ ."
POSITIVE,"Check-in was a breeze, but the front desk attendant didn't really expand on what our stay included (2 free drinks, pool/gym use, internet, what time check-out was, etc.) I know I could've read it myself, but as a courtesy, I believed this should've been part of the ""Enjoy your stay here with us."" She didn't really up-sell any other rooms that we mightÂ have wanted to upgrade to. For instance, I don't know if this was meant to be requested or not but our room had a very nice view of a wall in a back alley way. On top of that, there were 2 or 3 stations where these people kept coming up to us asking if we were going to come back to Vegas in a year for some kind of promo they're doing. It's nice to be asked once, but to be asked four times a day every time we came in and out of the hotel/casino was a little too much. Also, be warned, I think the toilets from the floors on top of and below your room are connected because our toilet couldn't stop making water noises!!! Our overall stay was comfortable enough because who really stays in their hotel room when they're in Vegas for 3 days only, right? But getting to the hotel from the strip was not very convenient."
NEUTRAL,The staff was not at all pleasant and cordial. Some of them didn't have whereabouts of anything in hotel whenever we asked for anything. Not a happy stay.
NEUTRAL,"The only thing i didnt like was the air quality but it wasnt that bad. Otherwise it was alright. We were hardly in our room, being it was so busy on the strip with events and shows. So it was a nice place to put your head while you slept. There was one cleanliness issue, only cause my wife is a neat freak. We left a note with a small tip to the housekeeperÂ and it was done the following morning. I would recommend it. Its quiet, compared to center strip. The bus stops right at the hotel and picks you up just down the street."
POSITIVE,"This was my first time staying at the Excalibur hotel casino. I am very happy with the room and location. However, the Round Table Buffet was not too good. I was expecting better quality food for dinner. At least some sea food other than boiled shrimps. Also, if they are just going to serve shrimps, peel them so that it is easier to eat instead ofÂ having the customers peeling their own shrimps, then go back to the Casino with smelly hands. The Casino lobby level does not have anything outstanding to make the hotel unique or standout as the ""Excalibur"". Perhaps a giant horse with a Knight on it in the middle of the main casino floor. Thank you!"
POSITIVE,Great location on the strip but I needed to use the two train monorail going south to the convention hotel and only one of two trains was running the entire stay which resulted in longer waiting than I would have liked.
POSITIVE,I did not book an updated room and it showed in the room but the bathroom was clean and the bed was clean. The air conditioner in my room was loud when it was on high and it did not work like it should have (air only came out of half of the air conditioner) but the room was a great price. You get what you pay for....I was only concerned about making sure that the bathroom was clean and the bed was clean. The carpet was old and was actually ripped in part of the room so I made sure I always had shoes on while in the room. Overall it is Vegas......who stays in the room more than a few hours to sleep? Great price decent room. Location: Great location
NEUTRAL,"Very good for the price. That's what we kept hearing, absolutly true. Not the best, not the worst, just ok. Weird smell. A huge step up from Imperial Palace. Pros: Affordability, look, get the widescreen room. Cons: Smells bad, lower end atmosphere. Location: Lots of good things close, not centralized as good as I would like."
NEUTRAL,"It is like any other hotel nothing Special. ,bath fittings has to be improved Pros: Courtesy of staff and helpfulness Cons: Bath room shower fitting not good Location: Very good"
NEGATIVE,"Terrible check in process took atleast 1 hour, could not walk through the casino with out being constantly hounded to buy timeshares, rude employees, the pool closed for entire day because there was brief rain with lightning strikes, the other properties had their pools open, we only found out after the day was almost over that we could have swam in those pools, I asked the front desk when our pool would reopen and they said they sent the employees home and it wouldn't and never offered the other properties pools, only nice thing was the pool once we finally got to go in it and the music they played was pretty good."
POSITIVE,"My overall stay was great at this hotel. We did have a problem the first night, the bathroom was not properly drained, so therefore it had dirt in there. We called them and they took care of the problem right away. I enjoyed the free drinks and the dungeon area for my son. The staff was great. The bed was comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Pros: Dungeon arcade, free drink and comfortable bed. Location: The hotel was at the top of the strip"
NEGATIVE,"The casino is great but once you take the elevator to the rooms a bad smell looms about. There were no other rooms available as it was new years eve. Otherwise we would have asked for another, but seeing as how even the hallway smelled I'm sure all the rooms did, too. The blankets were more like curtains! Awful!!! Also, had a window but all we could see was a wall. Not even sky! Never going back there again. Pros: Location Cons: Bad odor and no view from room Location: In a good location. Close to all the fun stuff."
NEGATIVE,"We arrived at the Excalibur Hotel Casino after a long flight from London to LA then a drive to Vegas, tired was not the word!! We checked in fairly quickly and went to find our room. Well, rather we didn't to be honest as we were soooo exhausted we just wanted to shower and get to sleep. Now I am not that fussy but do expect clean towels...they had yellow and black stains on them ewww disgusting!! Then when it came to getting into bed, I noticed the pillow covers & bed covers had black marks on them. We were as I have mentioned so tired we just decided to sleep & call to change rooms in the morning. Which is exactly waht we did. Ok so room two had hair on the bathroom floor, blood ( or something red ) on the bath towel....oh and we had a visitor in the form of some black bug about the size of a english 10p coin. I had enough at this time and went downstairs to contact expedia to ask them to change our hotels if possible. They quickly answered saying they had spoken to the hotel manager and our room would be upgraded to a strip view and checked to make sure its clean before we went there. We were told it was. Well yes guess it was if you like DIRT!! All I want when I stay in a hotel is nice & clean, I don't expect no speck of dust but I know I don't want all the above. We couldn't afford to just leave so after our 4 days prepaid, we checked out and stayed the rest of our trip in the Aria!! Now they know clean towels!!"
POSITIVE,"Great location with lots to do both in the hotel and in the surrounding area. The facilities are rather dated, with no wireless facilities etc.The bed was comfortable, the room was clean. Just a few little added extras would have been useful."
POSITIVE,"The front desk staff was super friendly at check in! Noticed it was my birthday and gave us a room with a view of the strip. Pros: Fun Dungeon was well, fun! Cons: The amount of smoke from smokers. Even the towels had a faint smokey odor. Location: Nice location"
POSITIVE,"We've just come back from a week's stay at the Excalibur and have to say we had a great time. The hotel is conveniently located near to the other hotels on the strip and the staff were friendly, especially some of the staff at the Sherwood Forest bar. The room was really clean and had two beds, the bathroom had a great little hair dryer and was well-lit and had plenty of storage space. The shower was fab. The were only a couple of minor points that were a bit of a disappointment which were the food court does not have a wide selection of outlets and as we had a room in Tower II on the second floor there was a lot of noise from delivery trucks, so if you are located in Tower II please request a high floor, the views from that side of the hotel are of the strip. Another annoyance was the constant hounding by staff in the hotel trying to sell us timeshares, some of them asked us the same questions four or five times a day and you constantly have to try and avoid them. Overall however this was a good hotel with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere."
POSITIVE,"Was a great stay and have nothing bad to say. The only thing I was disappointed in was the television channels were different in my room compared to my daughters room. I only had 13 channels and she had like 30 channels........ when maintenance came up to fix it all they did was unplug it and plug it back in and when that didn't work he just shrugged his shoulders and said thats all he could do. I just laughed because that was such a I don't give a crap attitude I would have never expected, but we were not in the rooms very much so I wasn't to concerned about that too much. I can't wait to get back out there and do it again."
POSITIVE,"I thought the room was clean and I didn't notice anything bad. There were some scuffs on the bathroom floor and some baseboard was scuffed up but I really didn't care about those things. The beds were fine and the floors clean. The shower was extremely low flow so that could have been better. Also, there was no coffee maker. To some, this isn't an issue but I'm a coffee drinker and thought that for how much they cost and the cost of coffee it should have been provided. I also didn't see a fridge but I didn't look real hard. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room. One of the review questions asked if this review was for families, couples, etc. I am writing this for a couple who aren't high maintenance. Also, keep in mind that I had a widescreen room and not the older unremodeled rooms. I don't think there would have been anything for kids at this hotel, but then again I wasn't looking and for that matter, I'm not sure if much of Las Vegas is for the younger kids. I know I wouldn't bring my young kids like some parents did. I was checked in within 5 to 10 minutes, the staff I did talk to were polite and helpful. I was from the airport to the hotel by shuttle provided by Expedia within 10 minutes. The ride back to the airport was also quick. My only other thought is that it may be worth while to get a hotel towards the middle of the strip so you are more central to all the locations but the room prices may get more expensive. All in all I was pleased. Pros: Location from the airport and price. Cons: it was at one end of the strip whereas a central location would have been more advantageous. Location: ok from the airport but at the one end of the strip."
POSITIVE,"The hotel could use some updating in the rooms. Old carpet, curtains, etc. For the price it is pretty fair."
POSITIVE,We had a great stay! They even upgraded our room.
NEUTRAL,exterior of hotel looks great and gaming floor is okay but why do they let timeshare guys have a desk to badger you rooms are pretty tardy and not very well cleaned
POSITIVE,"The NYNY hotel in Las Vegas is pretty good. I've stayed at 4-star hotels in Vegas that were not significantly better than this one, and they were much more expensive. They've got a fun roller coaster, pretty good arcade, reasonable tables ($5-$10 blackjack every day) overall a really good value. The food court is nice, with well-done Sicilian styleÂ pizza and Ben & Jerry's."
NEGATIVE,"We paid a lot of money (not including the $15 per day extra charge) for the room and the quality was equal that of a Motel 6. Definitely not worth the money. The bathroom was tiny with the toilet butting up right next to the sink. The sink kept clogging and the ""Queen"" size beds they claimed were actually smaller than normal queen size. When we triedÂ to call the front desk to complain, they were very rude and not helpful at all. The only good thing was the location, which made it easier to explore the strip, but other than that, terrible quality."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was clean, staff were helpful and friendly. Location was good and the restaurants were great within the hotel. Only complaint I have were the BJ dealers which were not overly friendly at all."
POSITIVE,Easier to get around in than some of the other hotel/casinos we stayed at in. Vegas.
POSITIVE,"This hotel is a bit of a maze, but clean and comfortable. The check-in line was long, but moved suprisingly fast. We loved the choice of restaurants and shops that are decorated as if you were truly in New York. If we had one complaint it would be the entrance where shuttles drop you off needs better ventilation. If you are not a smoker, the smoke from the casino will just about knock you out. Overall, very good experience."
NEGATIVE,"Our hotel room, particularily the bathroom, kind of icky.... it is in need of a GOOD cleaning not just a wipe and blow off the dust. I would not stay there again. The casino was average, smokey and the sad looking female dancers at the party pits did not impress me - mostly because I am married and don't go for that kind of a show. Fill your boots if you like ""dancers"". There was also a restaurant in the base of the hotel that was like a diner, our server was nice but terribly slow and the food was okay if you had to satisfy a large family with small kids included. I would never eat there again. I a can not recall what it was called but the menu was huge and there is a LARGE map of USA hanging fromt he ceiling. We only ate there b/c friends wanted to. Room Tip: do not stay there"
POSITIVE,Our family (2 adults and 2 children - 20&15) stayed 2 nights. Hotel had everything onsite that you needed including complimentary parking. Room was a good size but did not have a small bar fridge. We like having a fridge to put stuff like water and fruit in to snack on. Wi fi was great. Our room overlooked the rollercoaster but noise was never an issue.
NEUTRAL,"It's a decent hotel. The rooms are kind of small. The dealers are alright. I know they have to be up at odd hours, but more enthusiasm would be great. The beds in the room though are super comfy!! The maids did a good job, too. It's just nothing stood out compared to other hotels."
POSITIVE,"I traveled here on business and found it offered everything I needed. An assortment of food and fun was all under one roof. My room was on the 32nd floor and over looked the strip which gave a great view. The location of the hotel is good and not to far to walk to most of the strip. Bring comfy shoes, it's a must. I enjoyed the table games in the casino. Room Tip: Ask for a corner room over looking the strip."
NEUTRAL,Decent room size. Vending and ice on every floor. Clean rooms but casino smelly. Staff not very helpful. Got charged $20 to check in 20 mins early. Small pool.
POSITIVE,Nice suites and a wonderful place to stay the only thing is that we asked for a non smoking room and it did smell terribly we had to ask the concierge to de-ionizate it.
POSITIVE,"We had a blast at the NYNY. The service was great (from valets to dealers etc.) We didn't even want to go explore the strip, everything we needed was right there for us! We stayed in the park ave rooms and had a great view of the strip from our room! Plus our elevators were NEVER crowed like the other ones! Huge plus for just a few dollars more! Room Tip: We could see the roller coaster from our room but never heard it."
POSITIVE,"I stayed in the Staybridge Suites for 3 nights in July with my elderly mother and husband. We booked through booking.com, at that time I requested adjoining rooms or rooms on the same floor on an upper floor. When I checked in they had the request on the booking, my had two rooms next door on the 25th floor. From start to finish I cannot complain about the hotel. Check in was seamless, as our room was no ready they held our bags till later in the day while we went off exploring. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm where we were told about the âcomplimentary snacksâ This included finger food, as well as wine, beer and soft drinks. I thought this was a nice touch and there was plenty to go around. Complimentary breakfast was very adequate, again plenty to go around. We were looking with tables all 3 mornings, we never had to wait longer than 2 or 3 minutes. The rooms themselves were very nice with a large en suite, our room didnât have a bathtube which I didnât mind as we had a bigger sink area. The kitchenette was very handy for making tea and it was great having a fridge keeping the water cold. Some reviewers mentioned a queue for the lifts. We never had to wait longer than 5 mins and when you are on holidays whats the rush! One trick if you are on an upper floor is to get in on the way up so you have the lift on the way down. Also some reviewers mentioned the area was dodgy, I didnât find this at all. Yes there are sex shops nearby but there was never anyone outside. We walked back to hotel at 3am one night and I felt totally safe All in all this is a great hotel in a fab location with a very reasonable price! We will definitely be back! One thing to note is that they swiped our credit card at the start for the entire cost. The receptionist told me that it was only for security that we could pay in cash on departure. We went down and paid 90% off with cash on the second day. (We were travelling from Europe and had already changed the dollars before we arrived) On the last morning a bill was putting under our door saying they charged the remainder to our credit card. We were always planning to pay with cash so this would have been very annoying if we had not paid off the lum sum. We would have be left with $1500 dollars on the day we were travelling home!"
POSITIVE,"New York New York Hotel on the Vegas strip is designed to showcase some of the best that the real NYC has to offer. Itâs readily apparent outside with replicas of the Empire State building, a mini Brooklyn Bridge and once inside, a lobby is festooned with art deco metal trim and colorful murals fashioned after classic street life. Shops and restaurants reside in blocks that look as if they were airlifted from somewhere in Greenwich Village and plunked down inside a gigantic mall/casino/night spot. And then thereâs Vinny, the propertyâs bombastic ambassador whoâs quick to point out, âNew York New York may not be a good match for those requiring the utmost in pampering or the highest sheet thread count on the strip. But if youâre looking for a bartender who remembers your name and a gigantic party scene once shows like the provocative Cirque Zumanity let out, then this is the place.â"
POSITIVE,It was everything that I hoped for and more. I would stay there again and again and again :) Thank you.
POSITIVE,Top notch hotel that had everything we needed. This is my 2nd time staying here and I will always stay here whenever i'm in nj
POSITIVE,Very clean hotel with excellent service. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable. The food was especially good. The restaurant supervisor was phenomenal! Highly recommend this hotel. Transportation to NYC was easy.
NEGATIVE,"I really hate writing reviews like this but the management of the hotel is so poor I am compelled to write. There was hair in the sink, cracked floor tiles, and carpet not thoroughly vacuumed. Can live with that for a one night stay but then my spouse woke up at 2am with multiple bug bites (not bed bugs thankfully). Fortunately we were in a room with two queen beds and switched to the other bed and experienced more bites. Got through the night and went to front desk to explain the situation. No apology and I was asked to fill out a form and the front desk agent complained to me that I did not fill it out correctly. She also said she needed to take pictures of the bites in order to reverse the room charges. Her actions are a direct reflection of managementâs primary concern of following policies vs. common sense service."
NEUTRAL,If you have to stay for a few days away from home to another state this is very affordable. I had to stay for 4-days. The room I selected was for a business traveling person. Microwave-coffee maker and small refrigerator. The desk system works very good. The service level for rooms was good as well. Over all just fine! Room Tip: ask for the up graded room if your there for more than a day or so.
POSITIVE,Pros: The front desk help was very friendly and helpful considering we checked in late at night ad helped us with our luggage.
POSITIVE,GREAT AND CLEAN!!
POSITIVE,"Die Lage am Bryant Park, direkt an der 5th Avenue ist fantastisch. Times Square, Grand Central, Broadway Rockefeller Center und das Empire State Buildung sind in gehnÃ¤he."
POSITIVE,"We picked the Bryant Park hotel for its location and great reviews and so glad we went with it. My husband and I were staying for our anniversary and noted it on our reservation. We were upgraded from our Junior Suite to a one bedroom suite a few weeks before our reservation which was super nice and exciting. Upon checking in, John at the front desk was very helpful with reccomendations in the area as well as giving us all the informaiton about the hotel. Our room was on the 15th floor over looking the park. The room was simple but modern and loved the Molton Brown products. There was a homedics sound machine that was fun to try- loved it so much that I had to buy one. We were even brought a bottle of prosecco and anniversary baloon which was another amazing suprise. Even when we were checking out, the front desk was wishing us a happy. The staff is amazing and the hotel itself is fantastic. Definitely didn't want to leave!"
POSITIVE,"Still love this midtown location, SO convenient. And still love the hotel, despite the terrible lighting in the rooms. But in August we had a great welcome; in November we were asked if this was our first stay, although my husband is here at least four times a year. Hotel systems are better than that. Hmmm, in late November/early December, early evenings are absolutely chaotic with functions upstairs and hordes of guests milling around the tiny lift lobby (only two lifts) with total disregard for anyone wanting to do anything so mundane as get to their room. Avoid the whole lobby area from 6.30 to 8.30 is my advice. It's way too small for this kind of traffic. And don't get me started on Koi. We tried to eat there on two evenings but unless you are desperate for the experience, avoid - they are so popular, hotel guests are very low priority for them. Oh and haha, the hotel has now employed a woman in a cape to block the way of guests entering the hotel. At first I thought she was a fellow guest, maybe dazed with jetlag, but no, she was there five nights in a row just standing in the way, not greeting, not screening anyone, just standing. She and her charming smile would be better employed greeting in the restaurant, where the welcome is less than welcoming. Despite all of this, I love the hotel and will be back for more. Room Tip: Take a room with a park view and never mind the background noise, there are ear plugs in the bathroo..."
NEGATIVE,"from the very beginning (when i called to make the reservation) i was connected with what i was told was the ""director"" whatever the f*** that is. he was a sincere jerk and pretty sure gave me a bogus rate. My fiancee agreed to pay half so we took it. (christmas season, not too many nyc choices) Next, i was disgusted by the elevators breaking down every day of our stay (5 nights!!) and the workers looked exhausted and miserable. never again. i also believe liquor was taken out of our mini bar by someone working there and we were charged for it and told there was nothing they could do about it. NEVER AGAIN."
POSITIVE,Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are lovely. Hotel is very close to Time Square. Had a lovely time
POSITIVE,"Really friendly staff - nothing too much trouble. Hot apple cider in the foyer, robes in the room. Roomy shower, lovely toiletries, secure elevator access to floors. The bar is not particularly comfortable, but the cocktails are great! The breakfast is very good value. Good location for 5th Avenue, Broadway, Times Square, High Line"
POSITIVE,"Comfortable pillow top mattress, quiet, good value with breakfast and midweek free drinks, great location. Lifts take too long"
POSITIVE,"Very nice staff, great service, very clean, very good location....nothing bad to say!!!"
POSITIVE,"Stayed 3 nights on business and being on a corporate budget , I elected to stay at Econolodge for the price. Was not disappointed at all , the rooms have very simple decor but are very clean. Had free wifi and morning breakfast included at areasonable rate. Enjoyed and would stay again."
POSITIVE,"Nice place to stay for a night, though closely located railroad quite noisy at night. Though my child was sleeping, but I was waking up every time the train was crossing the intersection with the road. Another negative thing, but it was more personal, no yogurts at the breakfast, though it was pretty with selection of things. Overall we have been very pleased with the hotel and personnel."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here the night before we toured Biltmore Estate. We had an easy check in and the room was clean and comfortable. A microwave and frig in the room and king size bed. They had a wonderful little breakfast area with lots of different choices, something for everyone. In the lobby there was a computer to use to check email, etc. And only about a five minute drive to the BIltmore Estate. It was quiet here and we would definitely stay here again if in the area."
POSITIVE,"Overall my stay was comfortable. My room was across from the Main Office. Room was ready for my late check-in. There was a problem with the toilet, however the maintence staff was quick to come and fix the problem. Would stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel had no record of my reservation - so it was rocky from the start. The people were very nice and helpful but my room was a dump - clean but totally shabby, no screen on the window and it was broken so it could only detach, not open. Iwas put in a smoking room because it was the only thing available and the smell was terrible even though ""they had the windows open for a month so it wouldn't smell so strong."" Good grief. 5 minutes gave me a headache. I wish these people worked elsewhere because they were so accomodating and nice but to tell you the truth I couldn't even stand to sleep there and I ended up crashing at my sister's an hour plus away. I also judged all the other people who decided to stay - though I guess they had nowhere else to go. I saw one couple walking in with a pack of beer each - maybe that would take the edge off?"
NEGATIVE,"Assigned a room that had not been made up. Assigned another room that was next to what we suspect was a DRUG DEN! DID NOT SLEEP AT ALL. Listened to coming and goings of 'clients' who banged on the door. The 'neighbor' or a female guest would ask loudly who was at the door. The answer was yelled out and then the door was opened and slammed shut. The phone rang constantly and because our rooms had a connecting door we could hear them talking as if they were in the room with us. To top it off, the volume on the tv was very loud. This happened repeatedly until after 4 am. No apology from indifferent girl at the front desk. She assured us that no drugs were being sold at the RR Inn but we are positive that is what is going on there. We were very intimidated. The noisiest motel we have ever had the misfortune of staying at. If the above was not bad enough, we heard sirens 4 or 5 times and train whistles 3 or 4 time, so close we thought the train was coming through the motel. Breakfast was advertised but not produced and coffee was lukewarm beige water...yuk!!! Room Tip: Bypass this place, go elsewhere!"
POSITIVE,Very clean and price is right. Recommend it to those that r on a budget trip. Very friendly owner or manager.
POSITIVE,"Everything went as planned. The facility is nice, relatively new and well maintained. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. My room was quiet and parking lot was well lit."
NEUTRAL,"Overall a good hotel if staying in Fort Worth for business and need access to the airport. Rooms are clean, and although the building itself is older, the hotel has been updated nicely. AMR trains puts its pilots here when they are training, and the bar is always a good place to hang out in the early evenings if you want to swap stories with them. Buffet breakfast is the standard hotel breakfast, and the hotel shuttle runs like clockwork to get you to and from the airport. Most nights of the week this is a terrific hotel to stay at. HERE IS WHERE YOU NEED TO WATCH OUT. Every Friday and Saturday night the hotel books it's conference room for private parties. These parties always have loud music and go until midnight. It almost doesn't matter what part of the hotel you are in, you will not be able to sleep those nights. Loud bass reverberates through the whole building. The management apologizes when asked about it, but nothing will be done. You have been warned."
NEGATIVE,I stayed here as it was close to a training seminar I attended. The staff is friendly and helpful. My room was a disappointment - the carpet was heavily stained is several places. There was mildew around HVAC vents and behind the peeling wallpaper. The tub backed up from the adjoining bath but they quickly corrected that when I mentioned it to the staff. This room is not the quality I have experienced at other Doubletree properties. The breakfast was not much better than what I would get at Hampton Inn.
POSITIVE,"Great location, friendly staff and comfortable rooms"
POSITIVE,Our firet time tot stay in a Hyatt Place and it was very nice. I'd stay there again and owuld reccommend it to friens.
POSITIVE,"Would recommend this motel to my friends. Very clean, quiet, good breakfast. Pros: Friendly, good breakfast, clean, quiet and in a good location. Cons: Shower door seal strip was gone on the bottom and let water out."
NEUTRAL,"I could get a decent room at a decent price when almost everyplace else was booked solid for the TIFF. The hotel was easy to find and to access from HWY 400 and Hwy 401. The bed was comfortable There was mold on the bathtub grouting, There were no half-decent restaurants anywhere near There was no ATM at the hotel. The front desk was under-staffed.T"
POSITIVE,"We found the Radisson Hotel Airport in Madison, Al to be a good value for the money. Check in was a breeze and we were treated well by the staff. We only had one instance in which our maid spoke little or no English and could not communicate with us. We were there for three days and we chose to swap out bathroom linens instead of a daily cleaning. OnÂ day two we were told that there were no washcloths available and therefore, we had to reuse the ones we had. I was a little disappointed that the pool was dark (lighting was out) and that it was not cleaned daily. There were leaves and some garbage items floating in it for two days. Other guests as well as ourselves found no skimming net available at the pool to clean it ourselves. Also we were directed to get pool towels in the fitness room but over two days there were none there. No trash receptacles in the center courtyard resulted in can, bottles, cups and even a plate of pizza left on the tables. The restuarant breakfast was very good and their staff we found to be friendly and helpful."
NEUTRAL,"I stayed here for one night earlier this month as I had an early meeting the following day. It was the ideal location for me in terms of where I wanted to be the next morning, but there is not much else round there that I could see, aside from houses and what looked to be an industrial estate a bit further down the road. I was a bit put off when I arrived as the building does not look very welcoming from the outside - and there was a group of 8 or so men drinking pints on the front steps leading up to reception when I got there - but once inside, it is a nice hotel. Clean, nice staff, good sized rooms. I had room service that evening which arrived quickly and was very pleasant. I was offered a cooked breakfast the next morning, but chose cereals etc instead. I'd never go back there for a romantic weekend or a night away with the girls, but would definitely stay there again if I had another early meeting in the area. Good value, and I enjoyed my stay."
POSITIVE,Great location clean rooms would stay again very friendly staff
NEUTRAL,Clean room with good shower. Close to airport but difficult road for cabs to find and then get to.
POSITIVE,Fine Hotel...very difficult to find as area is very poorly signed.. Needed the GPS... Very good breakfast service compared to others. Best feature is the free 6 trips a day AM and PM on the hour to Balsden Metro stop. Great if want to make like tourists in Washington ..
NEUTRAL,"The good: bed was comfy, room was clean and quiet The bad: TV remote didn't work well and the wireless internet sucked"
POSITIVE,The hotel was clean and the staff extremely friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the location. It is very close to the Airport but however if you are going to go downtown more than once or twice I would recommend getting a hotel more centrally located. Pros: The staff was very friendly and helpful and the facility along with Denver was very clean. Cons: If staying in Denver this hotel is about 20 min from downtown.
POSITIVE,"The room was very clean and pretty spacious. The girl at the desk was very nice and seemed to enjoy her job. The only complaint I have was that the door were so noisy when trying to leave the room quietly you couldn't, but that meant safety."
NEUTRAL,"The room seemed to be fairly clean. The appareant sterilized tv remote was good. Waking us up at 11:00 pm with a failing fire alarm traumatizing our adhd child. What's worse, we had to get up, get dressed and get a battery. No staff to handle this. Hotel too close to road, just noisy area. Very dissapointing for a Best Western. Had no time to dispute bill because I was there to run a marathon. We needed rest! Don't like you your gay friendsly question."
NEGATIVE,"Not a fan of Best Western but had no choice. Â Anyways, Â my room was spacious but felt dirty. Â The air unit had a mind of its own. Â It was either too cold or too stuffy. Â  There was no happy median with the AC unit. Â Oh, with me having a fear of bugs what do I see on the wall? Â A remaining bug that was smushed by someone else who previously stayed here. Â Hopefully I don't have to stay at this hotel again. Â Disgusted."
POSITIVE,Accommodations where great for the price
POSITIVE,"I had never heard of a ""boutique"" Best Western Hotel, but certainly the rooms and ammenities lend itself to be called a botique, over other Best Westerns. The room rate is the lowest for the country club plaza area, but it is a bit of a hoof up a couple of hills to get to the hotel, from the main fountain entering into the plaza area. The hotel does offer a shuttle service to locations within a 10 mile radius, which is a real plus for those not wanting to hoof it back to the hotel."
NEGATIVE,"I've been to this property numerous times, so I feel qualified to offer travellers opinion on this property. Over the 15 years I have seen the property, it has declined dramatically. Best Western might consider stripping the property of its brand name, or Best Western is also in decline. The rooms are on par with a older Super 8 property. The front desk staff cancelled my last reservation because I did not show up by 4pm. The on-site restaurant is to be avoided, if you find it open. Drive the 1-minute west to Tim Hortons or McDonalds, or 5-minutes into Hawkesbury itself. Room Tip: To get a good room, ask to see it before you accept it."
NEUTRAL,"Free wi-fi. Good location Bathroom was very shabby, not at all like photographs on website, put me off havinzg a bath.Cutlery in room was all dirty, unable to use. Paid 5 pound for car park when free parking on site"
POSITIVE,room had damp feel to it. thought rugs might have been cleaned prior and not totally dry. wasn't sure. we have stayed at BW 7seas many times and this is first time room was not totally acceptable.
NEUTRAL,"This is the second time I have stayed at this Best Western. I sometimes travel by car from North Carolina to Connecticut with my 2 small dogs and I have found this to be a good half-way point hotel to crash for a few hours. They only charge $5.00 for each pet and there is plenty of pet areas. My only complaint is, the beds are rock hard. I don't mind sleeping on a firm mattress, but to me, it feels like a slab of concrete. I had forgotten this from my first stay, but was quickly reminded when I crawled into bed. I suppose its better than the alternative though. This is a typical motor lodge hotel, 2 story with parking directly in front of the rooms. So, be prepared if you are light sleeper. The hotel is a good enough distance from I-81 (but close enough to be easy on/off), so you won't hear much highway traffic. Plenty of food options close by too. If you are traveling solo and are a woman, I would suggest calling ahead and requesting a room in a building near the main building (check in area), there are numerous buildings and it can be a little confusing to find your room. I experienced this on my first stay, so for my latest overnight, I called earlier in the day and my request was graciously honored. The manager, I wish I could recall her name, Julie?, was most accommodating. She pre-assigned a room on the first floor and very close to the main building. All in all, a reasonable hotel that suits my needs perfectly. I am sure on any future road trips, this will be my stop off point. Room Tip: Request a room closest to the main building for easiest and convenient access. Bring earplugs if a l..."
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel is great area. Can't beat the walk to the beach and trails. Also walking distance to sit down dining was nice. Front desk staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast area was crowded and wifi did not work, but was able to use computer in office."
NEUTRAL,"We were just passing thru and needed a place to sleep. I thought it was a hotle but it was a motel so we had to carry all our luggage up the stairs outside. The rooms are over priced for what you get. The room was clean, nothing fancy. The towels were really old in the bathroom. The lobby is way too small for having breakfast. There is only 2 tables with seating for 8. If you weren't the first to arrive you either eat standing up or you come back later?? Room Tip: Make sure you ask for a non smoking room if you need one and stay on the side opposite the highway i..."
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, checked me in early, room was large & comfortable, jacuzzi was relaxing and breakfast was acceptable. Good value for the money! Would stay again and recommend for others. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet"
POSITIVE,Everything was excellent except no breakfast unless you pay extra Room Tip: no tips at this time
POSITIVE,"My boyfriend and I had to travel to Lawrence, KS for my mom's Memorial. We drove from Los Angeles, CA and it was exhausting and stressful. We, being huge fans of the chain, found the Best Western in Lawrence online. We really hoped for a very nice room for the impending stressful, emotional weekend ahead and that's exactly what we got! First of all, we were treated very respectfully by Farrah who helped us check in with Emma. Both ladies were very sweet and accommodating. Everything worked out and we were given our room keys. When we opened the door to our room, we were astounded by how gorgeous the room was with the beautiful dark wood and the orange and brown bedspreads on the bed. Not those typical ugly hotel bedspreads. It was super clean. The beds were really comfy! The ice machine was conveniently located. It was super quiet! You can walk to bars or restaurants from there. The best thing was the indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi! OMG! So fabulous. So clean. The pool is warm. It's pure luxury! Plus, they have a washer and dryer for your convenience. So handy! The place is basically flawless and the staff is super pro and sweet. I totally recommend anyone going to Lawrence to stay at the Best Western! You won't be disappointed! Ask for Farrah, she'll take the best care of you. Emma is the bomb as well! Thanks so much for the great experience. We would stay again in a second! Happy summer. :) Kelly & Wayne from LA. Room Tip: We stayed in the outside rooms. It was great! Very convenient. :)"
POSITIVE,"on the way to the Grand Canyon, think that is what most folks use this motel for...however BW has improved, this one was in the middle, we have stayed in worse and in nicer ones. The rooms are around a huge concrete parking lot which is visually not appealing, but it is functional, I guess. Staff upon ck in/ck out were fine, nothing extra, breakfast was nice, think this is a nice bonus many BW are now offering. Room was clean, well appointed, was quiet away from main road. For us, was a perfect stopping point from Southern California...we could get up eary next morning and were in Grand Canyon by late morning."
POSITIVE,"We got this hotel for a great deal on a name your own price website. I couldn't have been happier! The rooms were updated and very clean - I was very pleasantly surprised at what I got for the price that I paid!!!! I would have expected to pay much more for this type of room. Even though this property is located beside the expressway, we could not hear any traffic noise at all. All of the front desk staff were extremely kind and very helpful with information. They were professional and courteous - much more than I expected for the price and the star rating!!! It is an easy walk to the subway and on a very convenient route for getting to the city. It was only $17.80 from the airport to the hotel by taxi and once there, we purchased a 7 day unlimited subway/bus Metro card for $29. This was an excellent place to stay in New York with convenience to everything we needed as well as great amenities and service."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night...myself and my daughters. The hotel was clean and quiet. The ladies at the front desk were always smiling and very cheery. The rooms were spacious and nice and clean. My one and only complaint would be the comforters...too thin and not very cozy. Having said that, the beds and the pillows were very comfortable. I have stayed at quiet a few places in Kamloops and so far this would be my choice hands down."
POSITIVE,The customer service was great breakfast was good the hotel seems to be going through upgrades. The technology in the business center was up to date very good wifi signal the rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff was up to snuff. My only two complaint was that the T.V.'s in the rooms need to be upgraded and their isn't much in the way of real restaurants mostly fast food chains.
POSITIVE,"I rented a room for a birthday present for my two nieces (9 & 10). We had so much fun and spent a majority of our time in the pool area. They had a blast!! The room was very clean and spacious. I liked the fact of the 32 inch flat screen TV with the DVD player, and the convenience of a fridge and a microwave. One other unique aspect was being able to park right outside your room and having a screen door to leave open along with being able to open the windows. The kids also played outside as there was a large grassy area to play. The staff was very friendly and professional, offering movies and games you could check out at the front desk. The breakfast that was included had quite a variety of food to pick from which was great! I would choose this hotel again with or without children! Lori, West Fargo, ND"
POSITIVE,"This hotel is loaded with charm. The rooms are very large and comfortable. The bed looks like a real bed, not your usual motel-room monstrosity. We were comfortable and plan to return for a longer stay (3 days this time)."
POSITIVE,"The location was good. We were near some shops, restaurants and coffee shops. The gave you continental breakfast here that was free. They should pay us for drinking the coffee there. If you like water with a hint of coffee, it's for you. The eggs tasted like it was fresh from a microwaveable powder eggs bag. The sausage looked a bit different but surprisingly good. The apple juice was good. The service was good and the people were very friendly. Now, a tip for the fishermen...they have a freezer! I fished in Ninilchik theprevious day and had processed fish in a Styrofoam box I needed to keep frozen. They had room for two of my 45lb boxes to store in the freezer. That was convenient and a savings to me and was a pleasant surprise."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I were traveling from Mesa, Arizona back to Blaine, MN. I told him I did not want to stay here because of all the past ""bad"" experiences with Best Westerns. It was late and we were tired so he managed to talk me into it. I was pleasantly surprised! It has been totally re-done.The entrance area is beautiful and clean. The woman that checked us in was very knowledgable, friendly, professional and courteous. The courtyard and pool area were very nice and clean. The rooms were very clean with very comfortable mattresses. We were very pleased with the restaraunt, it's food and the owner that was on that evening. He pitched right in, welcomed and sat guests, checked on guests, cleaned tables (he was even wiping of the menus with santatizer) etc. We were impressed! The food we had was like a 4 or 5 star restaraunt (we are very picky when it comes to food). It was presented well and hot. Above all VERY GOOD! If you like Salmon (and I didn't-until that night) try it blackened. My husband had the rib sampler-also very tasty! The complimentary breakfast is worth the trip alone! We enjoyed our time here and would recommend this hotel to anyone going through Raton, NM. We will definitely make this our stop when going through again! Thank you for making that a nice evening and stay foir us! Marty and Lori from Blaine, MN"
POSITIVE,"The suite is a large room with a separate bedroom. The living area and the bedroom both have Televisions. The hotel is new and feels good. The only problem is that they bought JVC televisions and the remote is hard to use. We stayed here 2 times while in the area. The 1st was pre-booked, the 2nd time we came back because we liked it. There is a restaurant/bar next door we walked to which had a lot of items on the menu, steaks, Tex-Mex, seafood. It was a decent stop. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from Corpus. This is a nice place to stay with a short drive back to the Corpus, Aransas Pass, or Rockport areas."
POSITIVE,"From the moment we spoke to Felix from the courtesy phone at the airport, our welcome was assured. The courtesy shuttle was despatched to meet us straight away. The room was a good size, and the bed very comfortable. It was also quiet - very important when you're trying to get over an 8 hour flight! The breakfast was really good - with everything from waffles and oatmeal, cereal to fruit and yoghurt, plus a great omelette station so they were made fresh to order. We then took the shuttle again to the airport to collect our hire car and begin our adventure."
POSITIVE,"Very helpful and friendly staff, great location,and clean."
NEUTRAL,Hotel was nice but expensive. The thermostat in the room didn't really work so it was kind of hot. No free breakfast. There's a ton of shops around and the location is perfect for visiting the park. Drive highway 12 north. It's beautiful! People were also very kind at the hotel.
POSITIVE,"Great property! We chose this spot based on others' reviews and could not have been happier! Traveling with our dog is sometimes challenging...not here! There was plenty of room for him to roam. Our room was large and clean, our bed had a variety of pillows which made both of us happy. The hotel has a general store that has everything you can think of...plus! We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant....biscuits and gravy rock! Bryce Canyon is literally right down the road. We will be back. Room Tip: let them know in advance you are bringing your dog, they will save a convenient room for you."
POSITIVE,"We were traveling with another couple, our rooms were ready when we arrived and we were assigned connecting rooms wihout even asking. Both Front Desk Clerks (Father-Son) were very helpful, calm and kind! The check-in process was hassle free, the rooms are very large and very clean, many upgrades and amenities, beds were super comfy and lots of extra pillows. We had a great view from the third floor. Breakfast the following morning had more than enough for everyone in our group. After 6 days of traveling around the Custer, Keystone, Hill City areas, thi hotel was one of the BEST! Can't say enough good things about it! Room Tip: 3rd floor rooms had a nice few and they had an elevator which helped alot when you are traveling fro..."
POSITIVE,This place has a commanding view and is right on the Coastal Highway. It is a perfect overnight spot. Pros: Close restaurants Free Internet
NEUTRAL,"Decor is tired --- the hotel should be updated with fresh paint, wall coverings and furniture. The television was very old, albeit functional. ""Mountain View"" room option was a bit of a stretch. My suggestion is that other properties be investigated prior to booking a room at this hotel. Pros: The location was convenient with good parking and accessibility. Cons: The tired room. Location: At the North entrance to Yellowstone National Park.l"
POSITIVE,"at check in the front desk clerk was happy to see me, i was able to check in early as well. The hotel is on the beach, i didnt have a beach view but then again i only use the hotel to sleep not to stare out the window at the beach. the pool was a great temp. after a hot day on the beach. i also had a full kitchen which was very helpful. the grocery store was close buy as well. they had a patio area set up which was nice just to go relax. the waterfall was nice and i did enjoy seeing that. the room was clean. i work in hotels and i read so many bad reviews on some hotels but i have to say this one was clean. the beds were comfy and the bathroom didnt have hair. i can not wait until my next stay at this hotel"
POSITIVE,"After staying there this past weekend I was pleasantly surprised by the staff as a whole, as well as the cleanliness and all of the amenities. After checking in and receiving a warm welcome from the front desk I was amazed at the immaculate condition of the room. We had stayed in a suite, and I wouldn't hesitate to say that it was the nicest room that I have been in in years. We spent Saturday afternoon and evening outside by the pool area and the staff was very helpful. My extended family was having a ""party"" of sorts and the employees were very helpful. The employees outside were extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the hotel and surrounding area. The pool area was really the highlight of our stay at the hotel, especially because of the way we were treated. I can not say enough about how accommodating the staff out there really was. Additionally, the Sunday brunch was delicious and I will be returning as well as telling my friends who plan on coming out this way."
POSITIVE,"Great location, nice rooms, free wifi, friendly service. Good buffet breakfast."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed at this Best Western May 30-June 3, 2012. I also stayed there about the same time last year. It seems to have gone a bit downhill since then. The staff was very friendly upon check-in, considering that Tropical Storm Beryl was barrelling into Kill Devil Hills at that moment. The floors in the room were not vacuumed or mopped and there was something sticky on the floor in the 'kitchen'. There were hairs left in the bathtub--not very appealing and there were hairbands left on the floor in the bedroom and living area. the next morning we put out some money and wrote a note to the cleaning person to please mop and vacuum the floors. The floors were cleaned the next day but the hair in the tub wasn't touched. Overall, the room seemed to be a bit tired looking and in need of an update. The pool wasn't cleaned until 2 days after the storm so there was a lot of mulch in and around the pool area the day after the storm (which was hot and sunny).I will probably stay somewhere else next year unless this hotel is updated. Room Tip: The ""Stop & Shop"" across the street is excellent for gourmet sandwiches."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed for two nights and were pleasantly surprised. The room was better than expected, although it was a bit musty. It was quiet and we didn't hear any road or highway noise. The mattress was a bit soft, but that worked for us. Our friends had a refrigerator and microwave in their room, but we did not. We paid the same price, so I'm not sure why that happened. The pool was a good size pool. The hot tub was in serious need of cleaning. You could see the dirt on the sides of the hot tub. We didn't use it. We enjoyed the breakfast and felt the service was great, both in the restaurant and otherwise. The desk clerks were extremely helpful in describing places we could visit in the area. We would stay there again. It was a good value for the money we spent for a room. Room Tip: Ask for the room with a microwave and refrigerator."
POSITIVE,"Stopped here for the night as part of an extensive road trip. This is a beautiful property. The entire facility is immaculate. The room was large and beautiful.big comfortable,bed. Great tub though the bathroom is not large. There are separate double sinks outside the bathroom proper. Pool area, breakfast room and guest laundry were all attractive and very clean. Breakfast was basic and adequate. Did not appear to have an elevator so second floor rooms could be tough with lots of luggage. Room Tip: If you have a lot of luggage you will probably want a first floor room. Doors open to outside -no in..."
NEGATIVE,"We checked into our room about 3:30 pm and felt that it was too hot (it was 101 degrees outside), but figured that as it cooled down in the evening it would be fine. We turned the AC to it's coolest settings and left, returning at 9:30 pm. The room wasn't improved at all. The front office let us move to another room where we found the temperature to be fine. The front desk staff in the evening and in the morning were concerned about the timing of moving our stuff from room to room; at no time did anyone say they were sorry that we had to move all our stuff at 10 pm after traveling all day. This being said, the rooms are spacious and fairly clean (except for the bathroom) and the beds comfortable. The included breakfast is provided in the hotel's restaurant, which has clearly seen better days. There was a dreadful looking buffet of typical breakfast stuff, watery orange ""juice,"" and some ancient appearing oatmeal. Coffee (which was OK) is served by a waitress, necessitating a tip. This wasn't (for us) the cheapest place in town, I really expected better. Look elsewhere, folks. Room Tip: If you decide to stay here (and I warned you!), get a room facing west; that way your car will be sh..."
POSITIVE,"Rating between 3 and 4 stars. Room was very clean and quite large. It had a bit of a strong odor of cleaning product, but we had secured the room right after it was serviced, so this may be the reason. Location of the hotel is on the quiet end, one block off Duval. It was close to a couple of the ""hop on, hop off"" bus stops, so we used it for transportation also. The front desk helped us with an unusual request--very pleased with their willingness to assist. Outdoor pool was very large--clean and not too crowded. Breakfast area was VERY crowded and hot...it had decent choices including waffles, microwave sandwiches, etc."
POSITIVE,We stayed in an upgraded room (#318) which slept six. It had two queen sized beds and a pull out sofa. Room was very nice sized ( I think two regular rooms) and the price was reasonable. ($139). My only complaint is that the pool was nasty. I wouldn't even get in! Breakfast was free (you get what you pay for). Service was incredibly speedy. Would stay there again! Room Tip: Get an upgraded room!
NEUTRAL,"unevetful, clean courteous; exceeded expectations for Best Westren"
POSITIVE,"I attended a wedding in Prescott, stayed at the Best Western Prescottonian at a very reasonable price. The beds were comfortable, everything was very clean and the staff knows the definition of hospitality. The included breakfast was hot and delicious, the manager Allen made check in a breeze. The pool and spa was crystal clean. It is close to the action around the town square and the shopping mall. The customer service was the best."
NEGATIVE,"Was not pleased at all. Too many security gaurds following the kids around. If you are a hotel hosting a hockey tournament, you must be aware that kids need a place to do something in between games. I have traveled to many hotels for hockey tournaments and never have I encountered such security nonsense. As you are required to be respectful in sound as well as respect to the hotel, there were no such accomodations made for the kids to just have a place to hang around. The constant following of the kids/adults was over kill. The hotel furnishings remind me of the 70's. The a/c in the room was not cold at all. The woman in the store towards purchasing customers was rude, even when the kids were accompanied by an adult!!! Way too many rules. I would never stay there again and I would never recommend that hotel to anyone especially for any sporting venues where kids can gather in groups!!!!!!!!!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The pool was warm, though a bit small, but perfect for our family. The room was fabulous, with a king bed area with a tv and a wall partition with a sleeper sofa and another tv on the other side for thekids. Our major complaint is that during our two day stay housekeeping never showed up."
POSITIVE,"We arrived around 1pm and were able to get in the room right away with no charge. The room we had was clean, well maintained and equipped with a fridge, microwave and sink. Easy underground parking as well. Amanda, the front desk manager was very nice and helpful doing the reservation."
NEGATIVE,"My wife and I were invited to a fund raiser in Vancouver on a Monday evening in May. We knew that there would be wine served, so we decided to spend the night in Vancouver at a hotel so that we could use public transit and not drink and drive. We arrived for check in just before 4:00 p.m. The location of the hotel was convenient and we looked forward to a good night. The person who checked us in was not particularly friendly. He gave us card keys to our room and told us where to park. The secured parking required a card key for access. Neither of the card keys worked. I stayed with the car while my wife went back to the front desk. The same person who had checked us in led her back to the car park where he commented on how he would show us how to use the card key. I watched as he tried both of the keys and got the same results I had. He then pulled another set of key cards out and they both worked. I got the feeling he was disappointed that he was not able to ""show us"" how to use the original card keys. We parked the car and headed off to the room we had been assigned. When I opened the door, I discovered that the room was already occupied. There were clothes in the closet and a computer sitting on the desk. I closed the door and went downstairs and asked to speak to a manager. The manager listened to my concerns, apologized for the mistake that had been made and booked us into another room. Our room included a continental breakfast, the manager offered to upgrade us to the restaurant next next. He gave us a coupon that was worth $10 for the two of us. We then headed out to our fundraiser and returned later in the evening. When I walked in the front door the person who had originally checked me in ignored me. As this was a small lobby, his behaviour was quite obvious. He did the same thing a short time later when I went back outside. At about 8:00 a.m. the next morning, there were people outside power washing the building. Needless to say, we could not sleep in. Our cost for the room was about $116.89 Canadian. I certainly did not feel we got good value for our money. I have no desire to return to this hotel."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is very likely the best in all respects that one can find in Raton.The staff is exceptionally professional, helpful, & friendly. This Best Western is marketed as being recently remodeled & it is. Common areas of the hotel (restaurant,lobby,business center,pool area,lobby restrooms) are indeed new,modern & yet have still retained ""New Mexico"".The rooms themselves are completely remodeled as well.The ""non-smoking pet friendly"" room in which we stayed had tile floors, new furniture, new curtains, new heater/AC unit, & new beds.There was absolutely no pet odor of any kind, nor was there residual smoke smell from guests of the past. Bathroom vanity was all new with a granite counter and shiny new faucet.The diverse and complete complimentary breakfast was surprising.The usual repast of yoghurt and dry cereals with tea, coffee, juice and fruit appeared, along with eggs, potatoes, sausage & bacon, & made-fresh-for-you pancakes. A couple of detractors in this hotel are that during the remodel it would appear they skimped on the actual showers. It had a new curtain and the arched out rod that gives additional space, but the shower itself still held that same institutional, ill fitting and off colored plastic surround that is caulked in place. It was the ""tell"" in an otherwise well executed & smartly designed remodel.The other detractor was that on our fresh and clean beds with zero evidence of bedbugs, each bed held a pillow case (one of 3) that had specks of blood on them. Pros: My favorite things about this hotel are that the non-smoking room was truly non-smoking, recently remodeled, very professional and courteous staff. Cons: Least favorite thing about this hotel is that they skimped on the showers in the remodel-same mold prone caulk lines and ill fitting surround."
POSITIVE,"We hold a meeting weekly at the Orchid Suites in Roseville. The staff is friendly, helpful, and respond immediately to our requests. Especially helpful is Chase Davis, Sales Manager. We recommend the Orchid Suites of Roseville for meetings. Mary Strauss Mary Kay Sales Director"
POSITIVE,"We liked everything about our stay with two exceptions -- the posted check-in time at the front desk said 4 pm, the Hotels.com confirmation said 3 pm which created a bit of an issue but staff got us in with a short wait but they did point out that hotels.com was wrong. Second, the breakfast area should have had a microwave as we had our own gluten-freeÂ hot cereal which we wanted to prepare in the breakfast room to meet with another hotel guest but they only had hot water. We would have enjoyed a banana too."
POSITIVE,"We do not like Las Vegas, nor do we like the strip- so this hotel was perfect for us. We use Las Vegas as a stopping point to get to Zion National Park, Salt Lake, etc from Southern CA and will definitely return to this hotel. It was clean, new, quiet even on St. Patrick's Day weekend- had a great sleep there - AND there are great restaurants nearbyÂ (within a mile)- thai, japanese, tapas, etc. One thing- the breakfast was mediocre- but it was included in the price so that was fine. Cereal, bacon, eggs- it did its job. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,Clean and comfortable
NEGATIVE,The hotel failed to provided the type of room requested by your package at arrival. A king bed was specified but a narrow double bed was provided. The hotel did make the king available the next day after noon and that meant packing up and moving -a waste of precious time. This is an older hotel with heavy traffic evident in carpeted public areas.
POSITIVE,"Room was great as was the locationi. A wonderful breakfast that carried us through the day. The only complaint is that the defrost timer on the refrigerator was going out and making a loud ticking sound that echoed through the room. I unplugged the offending refrigerator and that was that. Also, the upstairs ice maker was out, but was able to get whatÂ we needed down stairs. Very nice stay overall!"
NEGATIVE,"Good: Staff was attentive, though not always helpful. Great location for being in downtown Minneapolis. Bad: Biggest problem was with Internet access. It took 24 hours for them to figure out how to grant me access to their wireless network. As abusiness traveler that is not good. I was supposed to host a webinar while staying at this hotel, but because of the problems with the Internet, I had to make other arrangement. And they did not offer to compensate me for this lack of access to the Internet."
POSITIVE,"This was a very clean hotel. The lady who checked us in was very pleasant and helpful. Upon entering the room it was clean and comfortable. Not shabby or old. When I noticed online that the last renovation was in 2001 I worried it might be dull and drab but it wasn't. The beds were comfortable, not too hard yet not too soft. We would definitely stayÂ here again if the need arises. Our business was in Austin but the hotels there were booked and this hotel was only about 20-25 miles away."
POSITIVE,"Convenient, friendly staff, very comfortable room. Room Tip: Location of hotel is quiet. Costco for gas is across the street."
POSITIVE,"We stayed long enough to sleep, eat breakfast and leave. The beds and pillows were comfortable, and they brought extras up immediately upon request., The breakfast was wonderful, and the place was very clean. I would definitely stay there again."
POSITIVE,"This place was great. Good central location to Iowa City and Coralville. Comfortable, and the theme was fun. Great place if you're bringing kids especially."
POSITIVE,The customer service was excellent.
POSITIVE,"This is the third time we stayed at this hotel, and have never been unhappy with the decision to stay there. We debated staying at a newer hotel, closer to the family's house, but decided it was best to stick with the familiar, besides that, it is much more conveniently located. One drawback ... the beds are HARD, but we sleep on a Tempur-Pedic at home, nothing compares to that little slice of heaven! The breakfast is well presented, if you want ""hot sauce"" you will need to bring your own ... the custodian Sunday thought picante was the same as hot sauce! No complaints, it's complimentary and well done! Room Tip: The back side seems to be the most quiet. We've stayed on all floors and liked the 3rd for that..."
POSITIVE,The two bedroom setup was great with the kitchen in the middle and the beds were so comfortable .
NEGATIVE,"When we arrived, the rather rude woman at the front desk mentioned the pool was closed (as an after thought after we mentioned swimming) and said it should be up the next day or maybe 2. It stinks, but I realize stuff happens. After 4 days, the pool is still closed. It has been repaired for a day now but no one will clean it. The thing just sits there and festers nasty green. We are in VIRGINIA during the summer...clean your stupid pool! during he pool repair process, they also managed to shut down the whirlpool. No one was able to figure out what happened and so that was also down for a whole day. Also, when i went to tell the front desk woman that our room door doesn't shut (i literally have to put all of my weight behind it or else I can push the door open with little effort), I found her sitting on the couch in the lobby having a loud personal conversation on her cell. I thought she was a guest...she was dressed in a casual yellow dress. I had to wait 30 seconds to a minute before she acknowledged me. The room door is still broken and the maids don't shut it right... Also, all employees so far have been rude. There is no ketchup at the breakfast and when we asked if there was any, the guy gave a very curt no and that was it. Really? The whole hotel has NO ketchup. The waffle maker requires spray but one day the guy just hoarded it and wouldnt let any guests use it. Ridiculous experience...I want my Damn money back!"
POSITIVE,"CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, NEW, PLEASANT HELPFUL STAFF. (TRAFFIC IN AREA WAS HEAVY THOUGH, BUT SO WAS THE REST OF THE TOWN)"
POSITIVE,It was awsome!!
POSITIVE,The stay great but the buffet was not the best but ok
POSITIVE,Ok
POSITIVE,"When we arrived at the hotel it was 10am and we didnt expect to get into our room but we thought that we would try. The woman at the desk looked for a possible room and after making some switches and contacting the cleaning personel she got our room ready in 5 minutes! excellent service in my book. The lobby was clean and attractive, the rooms were nice and the pillows were especially nice according to my wife and she is a picky pillow person. My wife also commented on the shampoo/conditioner, soap and lotions as all nice. The breakfast was sufficient but lacked the usual hot eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc that you find at most hotels these days but I am not complaining it satisfied our needs. Great location, it was located just off the highway as you come in to town and was close to everything. We would reccomend this hotel to others and would stay at this hotel again if we find ourselves in the eagle river area."
POSITIVE,Stay was very satisfactory. Breakfast was excellent. We have no complaints about the stay or location for us as we needed good acces to the tressel on highway 2.
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel if you can get it at a discounted rate. If not, you might want to check just a little further out for a comparable hotel at a lower price. Pros: Convenient location Cons: Overpriced Location: There seem to be no hotels close to central Waltham, but this one is about as close as you can get."
NEUTRAL,"For the price it was definitely worth it, but it was a very old motel and not in great shape. But the interior was nice, had a good big TV and microwave and fridge (I didn't expect that), and the beds were fine. It was clean enough and in fine shape. If you're looking for something super nice this isnt' the place, but for something inexpensive and decentÂ I'd recommend it."
POSITIVE,"Nice stay, room very nice and comfortable bed, only downside was no coffee available for guests throughout the day unlike most other best westerns, also breakfast was chaotic due to lack of room in dinning room."
NEGATIVE,"This was our second time to this hotel and we couldn't believe how much it had deteriorated since our initial stay. It was like a completely different hotel. The entire place smelled really bad and the public areas, hallways, were extremely dirty. We were woken up in the middle of the night to a drunk man cursing and slamming doors and fighting with somebody. It was scary and no better than staying in a cheap motel. We will not be returning to this hotel."
POSITIVE,"Huge bathroom with two showers, great location, nice staff"
POSITIVE,It was located in a very convenient location. Our toilet was not working and there was not a maintenance member on staff on staff afternoon at 5:30pm which is understandable but the reception desk attendant had it fixed before we came back and it worked for the remainder of the stay. I thought that was very good for them to be able to do that sinceÂ there were no other vacancies in the hotel. Other than that we noticed it was an older hotel but they have done a good job keeping it clean and nice.

NEUTRAL,"Overall this was a great place to stay for my business trip, convenient to the freeway, and only 2 miles from a mall with some shops, a wonderful Wegman's grocery, and a healthier option for food, Potbelly. My only complaint would be the noise outside the room being on the first floor and right on the parking lot but since I was going to bed early theÂ buses, roller bags, and garbage trucks weren't too much of a disturbance for me."
POSITIVE,"Nice recent renovation, very clean new rooms. Bar attached and nice chinese restaurant. Room Tip: We chose an internal access room as feels more secure."
POSITIVE,"i was nervous when i booked our room at this hotel because many people in my family had a hard time getting their reservation. there seemed to be a language barrier or something. We were all flying in to attend my mothers funeral, so i did not think i could handle any mishaps or i would perhaps fall apart. Checking in was a little rough as they did not have our reservation in their system, but it turned out our name was just not spelled right (language barrier, perhaps?). From there the stay was great. they were SO accomodating when my immediate family of 30+ people (!!) literally took over the pool area. since food and drink were not allowed in the pool, they let us use the breakfast area for our little post-funeral get together. They were very nice. There was a wedding that night and it seemed the entire rest of the hotel that was not taken over by us, consisted of very drunk and obnoxious guests from the wedding (including a very drunk and annoying bride). I mean, there was YELLING down the halls until past 3 a.m. I kept yelling out in the hall to shut them up and called the front desk and they tried to quiet down the guests, but to no avail. and when we checked out at 7 a.m. these guests were already up and being loud in the lobby again! since the front desk staff was so nice to us that afternoon, i was not mad at them. the wedding guests were just horrible. so i recommend this place with the caveat that you should check with them to make sure there are no wedding parties booked there!! and make sure they spell your name right when you make the reservation! Room Tip: do not book a room on the first floor near the lobby...it is very loud"
NEGATIVE,"So I have stayed at a few best westerns and this has to be the worst i have seen! Granted the area but i will never again stay here. I could not sleep as poeple in the hall are talking on their mobiles like its 2pm and bugs everywhere in our room. argh what a mess, i stayed here cause a AM flight but spend the extra money and stay somewhere else. Room Tip: do not stay"
POSITIVE,"I loved this place and would stay there again. It was a bit out of the city center, but not enough to cause a problem. The only thing- there was a bit of hair in the shower- gross. Normally this would be enough to keep me from returning, but the rest of the place made up for it. Loved the suite- it had a full kitchen!"
POSITIVE,"this is a small hotel but really nice big rooms and very quiet, the location is great as it is an easy walk to shops and restaurants plus a short walk to the beach. lake Tahoe s really beatiful and this hotel makes a great place to stay. they provide a really great breakfast that is complimentary and it's well cooked and the serving staff were really nice particularly James. Room Tip: I would ask for a ground floor room as there is no lift."
POSITIVE,"Location, cleanliness, comfort"
POSITIVE,Enjoyed it very much. Hotel was fairly full the second night of my stay but was very quiet.
POSITIVE,"I was disappointed pulling into the parking lot as the outside of the hotel and its signs looked a bit dilapidated. It was fine once indoors, however, and very comfortable. They actually had a comfortable reading chair, which isn't found very often. Very nice, competent people and decent breakfast. Easy and free access to internet was also appreciaÂ ted."
POSITIVE,"Good location, good price for the area. The hotel is a bit old fashion, I felt like Janis Joplin would appear around the corner of the bar. Friendly and helpful staff, specially a lady called Ladonna in the bar. Stayed only for one night, would stay again. Don't expect luxury, but its clean, safe, and organized."
POSITIVE,"I didn't want to spend much for our one-night stay near Hersheypark. Our room was basic, but very comfortable. The staff seemed to go our of their way to be friendly and helpful. The free breakfast is above average with lots of choices: cereal, yogurt, eggs, waffles, muffins/danish and fresh fruit. There is free wifi. The hotel pool looked nice, but we never had a chance to use it with so much else to do in the area. The property is only a few minutes drive from area attractions. I thought the $99 I paid on a busy June weekend was a very good value."
POSITIVE,"Our room was what you would expect and though there was some trouble at the first (the bath didn't work right), they quickly moved us to a new room. My only complaint was that they didn't comp any portion of our room. Their right not to, but a better establishment would have without being asked. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Quiet"
POSITIVE,The room was clean and the staff attentive. The sauna didn't work and I wasn't aware they had a jacuzzi until we were leaving. I got a 1:00 pm late checkout so that was great. The breakfast sausage and eggs were horrible but the waffles were OK.They can definitely improve on the breakfast.
NEUTRAL,"It was a nice stay at this hotel, the staff was helpful and friendly (especailly the person running the breakfast she was very frienly and helpful). The only thing that threw my girlfriend off was the underwear she uncovered behind the nightstand. This was over looked due to the many amenities available parking, breakfast, and the laundry service (this was excellent to use the last night of our trip). I would stay at this hotel on my next trip."
NEUTRAL,Like many of the reviews had previously mentioned the beds were extremely hard and not very comfortable. It was a good price and there was a nice breakfast. Pros: It was very close to where we needed to go. Cons: The beds were very hard except the pull out which had springs sticking out Location: We were going sky-diving near by so the location worked out great.
POSITIVE,"Booked this hotel because it was close to Disneyland, just needed a cheap one night stay and this was it."
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel, good location..the pool was not terribly cold, but it was cool and the hot tub (jaccuzzi) was not real warm. Someone did come in while we were in it and said it had been warmer the day before so maybe we should have asked if they could turn the temp up. Breakfast was good, waffles,cereal, etc. Not a lot of seating avail. but food can be taken to room. Hotel staff was very nice :-)) All in all a very nice stay! Pros: Cleanliness, location, friendly staff Cons: Cool jaccuzzi Location: About 2 min drive from Hot Springs Pool, restaurants, etc"
NEUTRAL,"room was large, clean and nice unitl night time... There are green super bright light sensors that flashe constantly, if you are a light sleeper, this will keep you up all night. Called the front desk about the flashing green light, the nice ladysaid they got complaints all the time, but the managment says the sensors save money, so they dont' want to change it???!!! Loud vehicle noises coming from the street/high way also was very distrubing, fire alarm sounded several times, did not get much sleep all night."
POSITIVE,Friendly staff...2.5 Stars closer to reality. Pros: Comfortable bed...clean...free WIFI and breakfast...convenient location. Cons: Older hotel...poor WIFI reception in room.
POSITIVE,Decent hotel to stay when you are in Santa Barbara. Pros: Close restaurants Quiet
POSITIVE,"Great hotel for the price, was extremely pleased with the friendly courteous staff, room was extremely spacious with modern accents. Will definitely stay at other best Westerns in the future. Pros: Surprisingly clean elegant spacious room for the price. Cons: Location was a little inadequate."
POSITIVE,"The desk clerks were very helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, since we wanted to stay near the center of the town. Breakfast was very good."
POSITIVE,"Every couple dream of having a perfect wedding day. That's exactly what the staff at the Garfield accomplished for us. From first going for a wedding brochure, you meet a friendly and professional staff. John Kelly, the manager and his team had everything running to perfection. The hotel chef's catered for 80 guests who appreciated a meal, which was presented and cooked to perfection. Most of our guests used the accommodation for two nights. Rooms were clean and well presented. There was nothing but praise from our guests regarding the service, room and the cuisine and would be more than happy to visit the Garfield Hotel again. Exceptional Hotel and Staff."
POSITIVE,"Gets a little overwhelming try to choose just the right place, but this was a great choice! Especially after the hair-raising but gorgeous trip down 89A from Flagstaff! Right in town, creek at the base of the property, and beautiful views of the red rocks from, I think, every room! I was absolutely delighted! Our room was in the North building with our own little patio. Very private and relaxing, but the rooms I saw in the main building also looked great with balconies and views. Landscaped beautifully, very charming. We enjoyed wandering the town on foot after dinner. Easy walking to all the shops and most restaurants. Right in the middle of everything. Room was wonderful. Big,spacious, fireplace, and the most amazing bathroom!! Jacuzzi tub AND walk in massaging shower! Great honeymoon or anniversary room! Will definitely stay again. Room Tip: All rooms in the main hotel have views of the rocks and I think balconies. North building has larger..."
NEUTRAL,Staff was great both at checkout and at breakfast...avg room ..good value
POSITIVE,"It was a comfortable room, & nice clean bathroom. Beds were comfortable. Great location close to lots of good eating places. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet"
POSITIVE,"When my husband's family began planning a mini family reunion for Memorial Day weekend in Edmond, I had visions of the luxurious room we booked when last we stayed in OKC, a concierge-level room high up in an upscale hotel. However, we knew that Edmond was some distance from OKC and my brother-in-law recommended the Best Western to us (for the nights of May 25 and 26) because it was in close proximity to his house. I checked Tripadvisor immediately and was delighted to find that though there were no hotels in Edmond, the Best Western Inn & Suites was rated No. 1 of the 15 motels there. Still, we didn't expect much. Therefore, we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Best Western. The staff was pleasant, friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and the king-size bed and (five) pillows were comfortable (with two soft peppermint candies laid out to celebrate our arrival). Our room number was 231, obviously located on the second floor, which was kind of a pain because there was no elevator, i.e., all of our stuff had to be lugged up a long flight of stairs. However, our room was very near the stairway at the end of the hall (first room past the storage closet on the west). Furthermore, the building was secure, with a card key required for entry, and parking, on the west side next to a red dirt cliff, was adequate. The room featured a sitting area with a love seat and comfortable chair, which was handy for late evening unwinding. My husband was awakened by slamming doors several times during the first night but slept well the second night. I slept like a rock both nights. The pillowtop mattress was a good combination of soft and firm. The water pressure in the shower was excellent and unaffected by the simultaneous showering of guests in other rooms. A bathroom fan would've been nice but other than that the bathroom was fine. Nothing fancy but fine. The complimentary continental breakfast was yummy. The first morning, we arrived with about half an hour to spare before the breakfast ended and the room was almost empty. Several containers were empty and were never restocked. There was no bacon and just one piece of sausage. However, my husband reported that the sausage was very good, as was the breakfast burrito and the scrambled eggs. I made a do-it-yourself waffle, which I think is so much fun to do with those flip-over Belgian waffle makers. The delicious ""malted"" mix came from a cold beverage-type machine where you press a button and the batter pours into a plastic cup. The orange juice was cold and very tasty. Other items offered included yogurt in several flavors, apples, oranges, donuts and pastries, French toast, bagels, cereal and toast. On our second morning, we went down earlier and the place was packed. The hot items and pastries were closely monitored and the bins kept full. As far as the location, the Best Western is close to I-35. The only problem we encountered was that left turns from the single entrance/exit are prohibited and the shortcut to my brother-in-law's house required a left turn. As we wanted to avoid the busy interstate, we were forced to turn right then reverse direction at the earliest possible opportunity. But it was all good. Overall, this place was great for the money!"
POSITIVE,"I visit NIST every year, and every year I stay at the Boulder Inn. Very clean, VERY large flat screen televisions, and a great breakfast."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel has a bed bug problem! I will avoid it like the plague from here on. My poor legs are covered in bites. The hotel owner said the he has had this problem before and has addressed it. But obviously, he has not addressed it correctly."
POSITIVE,"Great, friendly service in an extremely clean hotel. The hotel is directly across the street from the Mark Twain sites and has a good view of the river."
NEGATIVE,"Room smelled of mold, mold in bathroom. WIFI only works if you are on the first floor. side doors do not lock for safety until midnight and do'nt always require a card to get back in. soft drink machine did not work. carpets stained. guest services made the bed each monrning but that was it. did not take out trash the entire three nights we were there."
POSITIVE,"Inn at Face Rock is our favorite place to stay on the Oregon Coast. We just drove 4 1/2 hours each way to spend the weekend relaxing, swimming, walking on the beach and shopping in Bandon because we love this Inn so much. It is truly pet friendly, which is very high on my list of important points to consider. They even give you doggy treats when you check in. And, of course, Bandon Bill's food is just to die for! I had flat iron steak with a mushroom sauce and Emily had prime rib. For dessert there was hot (and homemade) apple pie with creme fraiche. And we had the best table in the house - the one on the lower level with the view of the ocean, beach and sunset out of the corner window. It was fabulous. Thank you, Inn at Face Rock for doing Groupon and making our fabulous weekend affordable, too!"
NEUTRAL,I stayed here for 1 night. Hotel staff courteous and helpful with requests. Room standard and clean. It's just a short walk to all of the sights of Old Quebec. The room I was in was on the main floor next to the main desk down a corridor lined with baggage carts. It felt a bit like walking to the servant's quarters and there was a bit of noise earlier in the night from people in the lobby (or bar perhaps) but was quiet by bedtime. Overall a good hotel and I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,"staing at this hotel was awsome plain and simple,pool,free breakfast,awsome staff."
NEUTRAL,Nice combo kitchen room for the money. Beds are not comfortable. Awake half the night.
POSITIVE,"Our stay in June of 2012 was the third visit to nyc and at this property. It is a super location and the hotel is clean and friendly, well priced and comfortable. Breakfast was a bit pricey! Would have liked a simple menu and lower price,"
NEGATIVE,This hotel needs serious updating for the price I was very dissappointed. The Hotel itself seems just as it is old and stuffy ..everything needs updating ..to be in this area I was very saddened by my stay..Would not recommend to anyone...
NEUTRAL,Breakfast included
POSITIVE,Nice cozy hotel nice in room hot tub room check with other hotel nobody has hot tub room like this hotel varity of selection on rooms
POSITIVE,"Very nice staff, well maintained and comfortable rooms. (Some of them have jacuzzi tubs!) Nice sports bar on premises with fun atmosphere!"
POSITIVE,"Friendly, helpful staff. Close to village. Nice place to stay."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Location off I-40 was excellent and it was nice having a hot breakfast to start our trip home. Cons: The smell of cigarette smoke in the lobby, in the hall and on the elevator was awful (not in the room though)."
POSITIVE,"Good. Got there late a night; had some trouble finding the hotel. Found sign off of Boston Rd. but did not realize that I had to travel way up the road. I first ended up at the Hampton Inn. The sign you had on the road needs to be lit, could not read what the sign said."
POSITIVE,I would sure go back. Many options for fast food close by. Cons: No elevator.
POSITIVE,Very friendly staff and the room had everything needed for a road warrior. I would highly recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,"Really nice staff throughout the stay. Â The motel is the old fashioned rooms that you park in front of your door. Â  Very clean and quiet. Â It is 10 minutes or so from downtown Bar Harbor, but still convenient. Â The breakfast lady is very friendly and remembers you each time. Â She keeps a clean area and is very interested in your stay, where you are going and if you need suggestions. The breakfast selections are great, especially the cheese omelet. Â Stayed 3 nights and had that omelet every time. Â We went for the cookies for a treat before we went back to our room and they were so fresh and wonderful. Â Knowing we are not ever going to return again, but will have great memories of this charming place. Â We did have a problem with our reservation. The staff fixed it so quickly! Â Again, if you are in the area, this is the place to go."
POSITIVE,"My wife loves the sound of waves and we've stayed here a few times and I've noticed from every water view balcony, you can hear the wonderful sound of just those waves. A clean view to a sandy beach I could literally throw a baseball to. Stay here, the menu has better food and the staff are so friendly. FYI while we regularly stay at fairmonts, this still didn't disappoint for a great Tofino vacation."
POSITIVE,"Pros: I really got more than I expected in my room, quite spacious and comfortable. Cons: Nothing I can think off."
POSITIVE,"You couldn't ask for a better location when visiting Ottawa. We were on the 9th floor with a balcony, water view (through a park) and a view of the Parliment buildings. I especially enjoyed lying in bed and looking out the window to see Parliment hill. It was a short cab ride to Byward Market. The only negative is that you are right at the bridge so the view of the Parliment building is obstructed and the bridge can get very noisy with the trucks and traffic. The hotel was nice but the room was a little dated. But it wouldn't stop me from returning. Keep in mind that it's a Best Western. Definately would recommend based on location. Room Tip: Definately ask for a room with a balcony, water view. But specify a top floor otherwise you're..."
POSITIVE,The free breakfast only had waffles that you had to wait in line to make as far as hot choices...there were no scrambled eggs no pancakes no french toast...very disappointed in that...otherwise the stay was very good...bed was very comfortable..possibly the most comfortable hotel bed ever..staff was helpful and free shuttle was a plus.. Pros: Free Internet Quiet comfortable bed complimentary airport shuttle Cons: Poor breakfast
POSITIVE,"The hotel was in a great location, right on Route 66! the staff was helpful in finding a nice Chinese Restaurant. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet friendly and helpful staff"
POSITIVE,"Folks were freindly, clean comfortable room although elevator was out when we arrived. It was repaired by the time we came back from our first outing."
POSITIVE,Lots of perks staying here. Gave us vouchers at the race track for $10 each. Best hot breakfast ever in a motel - was veryyyyy good. I was surprised how clean it was. Very nice. My travel companions decided I would book all our trips. Pros: Breakfast and friendliness of staff Cons: booking every inch of the parking to other horse track goers. Made it very tight. Location: Middle of Hot Springs. Good location
POSITIVE,"Close to everything - bars, restaurants. Great breakfast included."
NEGATIVE,"We had stayed here before and had no problems. But the last time we stayed, we had drunks running up and down the halls all night. When we complained the next day the staff were unsympathetic. Not even apologetic...won't be returning there again. Cons: Noisy"
POSITIVE,This hotel was a very nice place to stay. The room was a nice size and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was really good with a lot of variety. The breakfast room itself was absolutely huge. We ate in the hotel restaurant and had a buffet which was lovely. The staff were very friendly. I recommend this hotel highly.
POSITIVE,"Beautifully clean and nice room. Pool closed for shocking but I was given a pass for the YMCA next door. Great steakhouse and other restaurants, as well as a supermarket, within walking distance. Highly recommend."
NEGATIVE,"I cannot tell you how mislead I feel from this transaction. You need to look at what definition of a 3 star hotel is. As I mentioned above, I will never use your services in Sioux Fassl SD ever again! Pros: Absolutely nothing. Cons: Everything."
NEUTRAL,"Found smoking smell even in non-smoking room, exhaust fan in wash room too noisy, carpet has mites, TV quality not good - too old, micro wave difficult to use too old"
POSITIVE,Relaxing
POSITIVE,"The hotel was very clean. The room very neat - nearly remodelled bathrooms were gorgeous. We loved the vessel sink, although it was very high. The shower had excellent water pressure and lots of hot water. The pool was well kept up (although I don't think it's heated -- very chilly in mid-July). Parking was plentiful and FREE. The hotel is walking distance to several good restaurants, coffee, and a grocery store. However, the two queen room they put us in was too small for the beds they had in it. There was 5 inches of clearance on the side by the air conditioner and about a foot between the other bed and the wall of the bathroom/closet area. This caused an issue in that the a/c was blowing straight onto the bed and not into the room. So the person sleeping on that side of the bed froze and everyone else felt warm and stuffy. Our bad because we did not complain about it, but the a/c issue wasn't apparent until about midnight. In addition, we had a former smoking room. The issues with the a/c meant we could smell it. Go for it if you can get a good deal!"
NEGATIVE,"We've stayed at this property on several recent trips to Fairfield and I'm forced to concur in all the negative assessments. The facility is dated. The rooms are dingy, worn and frequently smell of smoke or stale air. The tattooed and poorly dressed staff are all too frequently outside catching a smoke by the abandoned grocery store next door. Despite the price point, don't expect the food at Kokomo's (the affiliated restaurant) to be anything other than what's available from the local Sysco distributor. This may not be rural Appalachia, but you can certainly see it from here. Room Tip: Be sure to request an exterior room. The interior rooms with a view of the pool are extremely dark."
POSITIVE,"On our way to Nashville we stopped in Memphis and stayed at the Best Western. The rooms were clean and there was free internet. The staff was nice and welcoming. Two tips that I can give about this hotel are: 1. the GPS doesn't always get the hotel's address. If so it's better to print the directions from Google Maps ahead of time. 2. If you need directions to Graceland or a map of Memphis you need to ask for them specifically, for some reason the person checking us in didn't ask us if we need this information though he gladly handed it to us once we asked."
POSITIVE,Excellent sejour
POSITIVE,"Great rooms. Spacious, big enough to handle all my gear. Great bed...best sleep in a hotel in a ling time. Pool area very peaceful and fresh. Enjoyed the quiet setting. Breakfast was well done with a very large selection. Very scenic location. Staff was very helpful in trip planning. Definitely recommend."
POSITIVE,Overall a nice motel. I was disappointed to find the internet service (WiFi) unavailable due to upgrades and the Hot Tub closed. It would have been fair for them to have credited some token discount for the lack of advertised amenities.
POSITIVE,"Bed was comfortable, breakfast was good."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable and convient. Harold, the manager, was very pleasent and went out of his way to accomodate our three families. Pros: The large room and very clean"
POSITIVE,"We were traveling from the Grand Canyon to Death Valley with our RV, and Pahrump seemed a great stop-over for the night. By late afternoon we reached Pahrumpand booked into the RV park of the Best Western in town, so I can't say anything about the actual hotelÃ¶ rooms. Our RV space was roomy and also had a picnic table, as well as full hookups. There was a really nice and clean shower / restroom building down the lane, and there would have been a pool, but we didn't use it. The space behind the actual motel was very green and shaded by luscious palm trees, and the pool looked absolutely great. We had dinner at the restaurant inside the Best Western, Wulfy's. Walt had pizza and it was absolutely delicious, and so was my chicken salad, and prices were very reasonable. The waitress was really friendly as well. However, this non-smoking section was next to the bowling lanes, and the kids playing it seemed to think that the decibels you could produce when you smashed the balls down on the lanes was what made you score high, the place gets a zero for atmosphere. We'd definitely stay there again if we ever need to spend the night in Pahrump - but we'd probably eat at a different place."
POSITIVE,"I needed a place to stay close to the airport that would provide shuttle to and from the airport. The staff was helpful, the room was good. My only complaint was that I had a pool-side room and had problems keeping the light from the pool areafrom bleeding around the drapes into my room. It made my room rather bright."
POSITIVE,Only there for less than 12hrs just to sleep and move on. good location and nice breakfast included. Pros: Nice breakfast.
POSITIVE,Good hotel clean room nice pool and hot tub friendly staff Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet
POSITIVE,"Some confusion at check in, but no big deal. Room comfortable and clean."
POSITIVE,"I just stayed at the Best Western Heritage Inn in Chattanooga Tennessee, the was the best value for the money. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and new rooms. I'm planing on staying there for all my business trips."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel. Clean, friendly and easy to find."
POSITIVE,"It was an okay hotel. Not quite like the big resorts in Palm Springs / Indio, but well worth the price."
POSITIVE,"Very clean, great service, great breakfast."
POSITIVE,"Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay, easy access to all of Historical Savannah. Breakfast was great! Smoke free environment throughout was a definite plus. With truck traffic noise on W Bay St,, I would probably book the back side of the hotel next time. There was no way to deflect the air from the AC, so it blew directly across the beds, a problemÂ at night."
POSITIVE,Better than expected for a rural location. Nice large clean rooms. Free wifi. Friendly and helpful staff. Did the job nicely. no complaints here.
POSITIVE,The staff was very friendly. The room was very clean...tv couldve been larger but I didn't stay there to watch tv..would stay at this hotel again if Im in the area..close to interstate and restaurants
POSITIVE,"Easy to locate, right off the interstate. We enjoyed our stay."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here due to their pet acceptance. Other than some possible old stains in the carpet, we found no real problems. Room was clean and we had everything we needed. No foul odors other than that ""old stale motel"" smell upon arrival. That odor went away shortly after turning the A/C on so I wouldn't call that a deal breaker by no means. Next time we go to Stone Mountain, we are likely to stay there again. Pros: Pet friendliness and proximity to Stone Mountain Park. Cons: none Location: Is close to an Outback Steakhouse and appeared to be in a relatively decent neighborhood."
POSITIVE,Best Fish Tacos and Happy Hour!
POSITIVE,Inviting!!!
NEGATIVE,The pictures didn't represent the facility.
POSITIVE,"The staff was courteous, professional, accommodating, and personable. It is perfectly located for my purposes, and I enjoyed the fact there was shopping nearby. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the decor. The hot tub was a bit over chlorinated - I believe they could use ozone or something else (maybe less chlorine) to keep the pool clean. My sink was slow draining, and although the refrigerator was a good size it was out in the open (no cabinet). There is only 1 luggage cart and when I checked out it was not available and the staff wasn't able to locate it. Perhaps they could get another so there are two on hand."
POSITIVE,"Spacious room, M/wave & refrigerator, good privacy in room, free parking, variety at breakfast buffet. Very friendly and helpful staff. Children running in room above quite irritating. Could hear every footstep."
POSITIVE,"The people here were very nice, and the room was a good value. Remodeled, new furniture, and clean. Also pet friendly for a very small fee. Would definitely stay here again when we return to Cairo!"
POSITIVE,You only have once to make a great first impression. First impression was impressive. Walking in the front door the hotel lobby was clean and had a pleasant odor. The staff behind the desk were friendly and engaging. The walk down the corridor was also pleasant and very clean. The room was a great size and was well appointed and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again.
POSITIVE,"Good people, good value! Large very clean rooms. Good continental breakfast."
NEUTRAL,"Wonderful staff. Rooms were OK - a little out dated. Bring your own shampoo. I don't know if it's a Best Western thing, but I'm finding lately, they don't provide any shampoo or conditioner. Breakfast was hot and good. It was raining so we didn't get to try out the pool. OK stay - little over priced I thought for what you got. Room Tip: Say they have smoking, but you be hard pressed to find a room...."
POSITIVE,"I had no real complaints, except that there was no hot tub/spa."
POSITIVE,"Great choice! Lovely hotel, away from hectic Bend. The staff and accommodations are very nice. Cookies available upon check-in. Newspaper with a hot cooked breakfast. Business center to check your email. All the amenities at a great value. Very quiet and restful sleep! Convenient launching point to explore Ft Rock, Crack-in-the-Ground and other nearby sights. Room Tip: Select room facing away from nearby highway."
NEUTRAL,"Tv didn't work, lots of road noise, uncomfortable bed. The staff was nice upon check in, but the room was below average and the road noise kept us up most of the night. We were located in a room in the middle of the hotel and were not very close to the road. Would not recommend for those who want a good nights sleep. Not sure why this hotel got a rating of 4."
POSITIVE,"We appreciated that the hotel staff had turned the a/c on prior to our arrival. This made our stay even cooler, lol. The room was nicely furnished and met our needs perfectly. There were a total of 4 rooms in our party (we came to join 2nd annual Chad ""Chubbs"" Lambert Memorial Ride to Remember.) The others also spoke well of the hotel. My brother stated he was a little unsure when he first drove up but pleasantly surprised when he went into his room. Staff were pleasant and helpful. We would definitely stay here again Pros: Comfortable room Cons: Wish it was closer to our event Location: Easy to find. Quiet location even though close to railroad and highway"
POSITIVE,"Check-in was a breeze. All interaction with staff was courteous and friendly.The hotel was clean and well kept, looks like they just completed some interior updates. The pool and jacuzzi were very clean. Did not use the fitness center but it looked like they had some nice equipment. Location: Good location, very convenient off the expressway. Several fast food and sit down casual restaurants nearby."
NEGATIVE,"In over 30 years of business travel, this was the absolute worst hotel I have been in. Parking was free though."
POSITIVE,Thank u for being available for family members. Just wish u had availability the other 2 nights requested.
POSITIVE,Hair in the shower. Wasn't cleaned well!
POSITIVE,The staff way great.
POSITIVE,Hotel is good and in a convenient location.There is a 7-eleven across the road to buy coffee and donuts in the morning.There are lot restaurants around and Taxis were available 24X7. Walkable to most parts of the downtown. City bus stop is close by. Pros: View from the hotel room and cleanliness is good. Cons: Felt room is little smaller.
NEGATIVE,"This hotel was not worth the money we had to pay. The restaurants food was terrible, we had to send back 2 of our orders and it was very pricey. The waterpark was very small compared to what they describe on the website. The workers were very rude, we did have 1 person that worked there and she was pleasant. She did apologize for any inconvenience. IÂ would not stay at this hotel again nor would we recommend it to anyone especially for the price."
POSITIVE,Remodeling efforts made this a quality stay. Very nice accommodations.
POSITIVE,"We just spent the week here and loved it! I have a 4 and 2 year old and it was perfect for them. Of course my kids favorite thing to do on vacation was swim, and the pools were perfect for them. I loved the 1 foot wading pool that kept my kidsentertained for hours and I didn't have to hold them in the pool! The breakfast and room were great, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again!"
NEGATIVE,"Stayed here for business, the country kitchen next door had a terrible breakfast. The rooms are old and out dated, although clean. Staff was average at best, would not stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Before I booked this hotel, I read your reviews. I agree with several other reviewers, that it is fine for what it is. You aren't paying to stay at the Ritz. When we arrived, the desk clerk was extremely friendly and welcoming. We got there around noon. Since checkout is usually 3 p.m., we thought we would have to come back later to check in, but she called housekeeping and found a clean room for us. She is a great representative for the hotel!From that experience, I would say the staff was outstanding, but the next morning, we passed the housekeeping staff in the hall and they were not friendly at all. Neither was the staff in the breakfast room. The breakfast was o.k., but really heavy on starches with no fruit, not even a banana.The first thing I notice in lower-priced hotels is the cheap carpet. This hotel was no different, but the room was clean. The bathtub was one of the shiniest I have seen, although the toilet was stained. The blankets on the bed were thin and it was a cold night so I was a little chilly.We play poker at Hollywood Casino and can usually get a room there at the poker rate. They were full last weekend so we looked for an inexpensive hotel nearby since we just need a place to sleep at night and shower the next morning. I would stay there again, but am not sure that I would recommend it to friends. Pros: The front desk staff Cons: Thin blankets Location: One of the first hotels off the highway in Tunica. Short drive to Sam's Town, Hollywood, and Resorts casinos."
POSITIVE,It will be our pick if we go back again.
POSITIVE,"Cons: Room smelled of mildew or mold, but they let us have another room and it was fine."
POSITIVE,Very good breakfast choices. I enjoyed the pool and the ping-pong table.
POSITIVE,We stopped here 1/2 between Atlanta and Orlando on the first night of our family vacation. Clean and comfortable hotel with a very friendly staff.
POSITIVE,"We needed a place along I-70 to stay for one night. 2 adults, with a large dog and a 7 month old baby. The property was very nice, the room / suite was large and very comfortable, everything was very clean, and the hotel check-in staff was friendly and helpful. Nice surprise to find a dog-friendly hotel that was so comfortable and clean. It was a welcome stopover for some weary travelers."
POSITIVE,"This was a great stay. Cleanliness is a number one priority for me and I would have given the room a 5, but the pull out sofa had some questionable stains on it. Our friends next door had the same issue. Not a big deal for us because we didn't need to use it. Otherwise, the room and bathroom was very clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would say the overall condition of the hotel was good, even though the ice machines weren't working very well. The breakfast was good with some cold and hot items on it. Definitely an easy way to start the day. The location was great just off of 55, so it was easy to get downtown and to other attractions. I would stay here again and would recommend it to someone who was looking for a clean,good value hotel. Pros: Cleanliness and size of the room, good breakfast Cons: Nothing else around the hotel (restaurants, shops, etc.) Location: Right off of the highway, about 15-20 minutes south of downtown, easy to get to"
POSITIVE,"Originally researched this place on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. It is small but friendly, not glamorous but comfortable, clean with a lovely small pool by the side, computer access if you need it with free WiFi if you have your own. Plus free lemonade, coffee etc all day and a very helpful info desk. Loved siting on my balcony late at night overlooking the stretch of water and the city at the back of the hotel."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was a short walk to French Quarter. Short drive to other areas. We drove to see areas affected by Katrina. Residents were happy to talk to us. They appreciated that people cared about their plight. So sad to see so many homes that were boarded-up, demolished."
POSITIVE,"Right on a long, sandy beach which was great for walking but the waves were too much for swimming. The room was simple but very clean - we couldn't have asked for anything more! Its just a few miles of cross town driving to the Aquarium (a must see!), as well as Fishermen's Wharf and Cannery Row. Definitely recommended!"
NEUTRAL,I expected more for the price. The bed was comfortable. Pros: Location & Bed Cons: Size and age of room Location: Close to shops & restaurants
POSITIVE,"I was very impressed with the spaciousness of the rooms as well as the decor. The room had a microwave, sink, fridges, cupboards, plenty of seating and smelled and looked clean. The bathrooms are boring and dated and they come with no toiletries, only tacky dispensers that are attached to the wall, and there was no conditioner. The pool area had plenty of loungers and towelsbut was in the parking lot. May have been nicer to have some type of tropical vegetation surrounding it. ... Pros: The rooms were spacious and clean. Lobby was very nice and they had laundry facilities. Cons: The hotel showers were dated and old looking, as well the only toiletries they had were dispensers attached to the wall and there was no conditioner."
POSITIVE,"We stayed only 1 night before heading to the airport. We decided to eat the restaurant on site and it was delicious but yes , it is very expensive but when it is that good , who cares ! The room was average size,very quiet and very clean. The business center is very convenient if you need to print your plane tickets and it is free. The internet is included in the price of the room. They also provide a breakfast that was was quite impressive : waffles , toast , yogourt , fruits , lots of different drinks including coffee, etc... They do have a free shuttle to go to the airport every 30 minutes if I remember. I was very happy with the experience and the front staff was very friendly. would I stay there again? YOU BET!"
NEUTRAL,"This was a disappointing stay of two nights. Wifi is advertised, but never worked. It was brought to the attention of the management, but as stated, it never worked. The first morning we where awoken at 9am to the fire alarm going off. After going outside, the local fire department arrived, walked in, turned around and left. No fire danger I assume. After returning to our room, I proceded to take a shower. About half way through, the water ceased to exisit. After calling the desk, we where informed the city had turned off the water. A little notice from the desk would have been very nice before having the water run out. All in all, there was a lot that happened in the two nights that we stayed, most not the fault of the establishment. But the wifi was a real setback. Thank goodness for smartphones . I don't know if I would stay here again. Pros: It was clean. Cons: Lack of wifi, front desks lack of notifying of problems. Location: Location was convient to freeway, airport and dining."
POSITIVE,"The going rate for this hotel was $69.00. Was a little afraid, but was pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and spacious, beds comfortable and the entire hotel was very quiet. I don't think there were many quest, but still very quiet. Arrived late, but front desk was helpful and pleasant. As for the breakfast, the best thing was the waffles. Not much fruit and only one flavor of yogurt, but bread and bagels appeared fresh. The usual breakfast offereings. For the price, would stay again."
NEGATIVE,"I was told there were no non-smoking rooms. The entire hotel smelled like cigarettes. My room was even worse. I opened the window but it didn't help. When I checked in they offered me a bottle of Febreze before I even went to the room. That should have been the first sign. My family refused to stay here and found other places to stay. The toilet paper wasn't even real paper, it fell apart when you tried to take some off the roll. It was a dirty room. There was gross stuff on the side of the bathtub and on the bathroom door. The caulking was cracked and moldy. The shower curtain wasn't installed right so the shower curtain wouldn't stay in place. This is not a 3 star hotel. Stay at the Holiday Inn or La Quinta in Jacksonville. Also...not that the hotel can control this...there was a guy walking around barefoot the entire time. There was also a crowd of people hanging out in the parking lot and around the pool all night which didn't make me feel safe. The pool isn't locked and was open to the street so there was no monitoring of the people using the pool since it is open 24 hours. The walls were paper thin. You could hear the people moving the blankets even in the next room. I couldn't turn the TV down low enough for them not to hear it. The remote control was gross and was taped together. Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet Cons: Noisy smells like an ashtray dirty"
NEUTRAL,"The Best Western Austrian Chalet was probably the nicest hotel in Campbell River, British Columbia, but is showing it's age. The room we had was small, and the bathroom smaller yet! The beds were average, but not the most comfortable we've had in our travels. The free continental breakfast was just like what many other hotels offer their guests. The room was clean, but definitely had that 1970's look going on. A plus was that it was close to town and located right across the street from the seaside walking path."
POSITIVE,"While we were staying at the hotel there was a storm that resulted in damage to our car. The hotel staff, in particular a young lady named Jennifer was so helpful. She made a situation which could have been very time consuming and quite bothersome run very smoothly. I really appreciate her and attention to detail. She is a real asset to the staff andÂ a treat to hotel guests."
POSITIVE,"This is usually our first stop when we're driving south . There are rooms with exterior corridors that make it easy to unload luggage. There is a restaurant on-site that has a creative menu and the food has always been delicious, as is the complimentary breakfast buffet. The staff is friendly and helpful. The furnishings are slightly dated and tired, but this hotel is comortable and with no surprises. We will stay here again."
POSITIVE,We had a lovely one night stay in Bournemouth. the weather was fantastic so we did not use any of the spa facilities. The room was clean and comfortable although a mini fridge would be useful. The staff were helpful and friendly. Service was a little slow in the bar areas and they could have done with more staff on this very busy weekend. The location was ideal for the beach and Bic. Pros: Friendly staff Cons: slow service in the bar areas. A little bit pricey Location: Ideal for the BIC and beach
POSITIVE,"Comfortable room, all non-smoking 2 room suites, lots of pillows, wet bar in room, breakfast was more than the sweets... Baccon, eggs, biscuits & gravy, waffles, muffins, cereals, bagels and more. The 2 rooms is a plus because I had a small meeting to host and did not have to rent a meeting room, the living room worked out just fine for us. And did I mention the room was central air."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel with family in spring '11 and '12 and will return again and again. Very close to attractions, clean and has a nice pool. During our recent stay, Stacey and Scott went out of their way to ensure we were happy."
POSITIVE,"For the same price of a room, this motel offers spacious, clean suites. Professional, courteous staff. Above average breakfast bar. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet"
POSITIVE,"This was our 3rd or 4th visit and generated our 1st complaint. It was the 1st time we stayed on the ""Walmart"" side of the building. It's only about 200 feet from the Walmart parking lot. Trucks park there overnite and it was quite noisy. When I complained at the front desk, I was told that there was nothing they could do about it. I will only stay there again if they can guarantee me a room on the other side of the building. Room Tip: Stay away from the Walmart parking lot!!"
POSITIVE,"Stay here often and I am usually very satisfied with the stay. Pros: Stay here often. Service, cleaning and restaurant are consistent . Cons: Nothing really. Rooms are outdated but clean."
POSITIVE,"This was a very pleasant experience. The room and bathroom were clean, all of the amenities funcitioned as they should. The breakfast was more/better than expected. A good value for the money."
POSITIVE,"Enjoyed our stay. Staff was friendly, room was clean, and this is the closest location to Legoland. No problems like other reviewers mention, we will definitely be returning again this summer."
POSITIVE,"Good location. Outside facing door rooms. Older hotel, but not bad for a reasonable price on a waterfront lot. Budget travelers will like it. Business travelers will find better. Pros: The outdoor spaces were very nice. Cons: The rooms were older and dated. Lots of wear and tear."
POSITIVE,@HotelQuebecCity This Best Western breakfast is delicious! homemademaplesyrupftw #quebeccity @StudentTrip
POSITIVE,THIS HOTEL IS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO STAY THE BREAKFAST COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
POSITIVE,Everything you do is amazing! Love your hotel!! :-)
POSITIVE,My friend and i stayed at the Best Western on last minutes notice for a trip to Long Beach. We weren't expected such a great comfy hotel. Everyone was really nice from the reception to the cleaning people. I highly recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,"Stayed here to attend event in Catskills. Hotel was clean and a good value for the price, nothing fancy. Convenient to Thruway, and rural 5-10 min drive to places to eat. Appreciated the standard amenities, continental bkfast & newspaper."
POSITIVE,Hotel was clean and sitting in a nice location. Can't really beat it for the price I paid.
POSITIVE,Stayed here for out of town work last month and came back.. great hotel.
NEUTRAL,The hotel worth the money that I pay. Personnel amiable and helpful
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,visted family was great.
POSITIVE,"I selected the Best Western hotel based on reviews I had read, the great price they gave me, the location, and the fact it had interior room access only for safety. The front desk staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. The hotel was nicely decorated, fresh and clean. My room was clean every day and they provided a nice expanded continental breakfast. I stayed 8 days and used the business center once to print off some documents. I used the Wi-Fi every evening and it worked great. The hotel was conveniently located close to numerous restaurants and close to the highway, but not close enough that you heard the road noise. In fact, I drove across the street to Cracker Barrell twice for a good evening meal. There were also a couple of grocery stores nearby that I visited to buy items for snacking and to make a packable lunch for during the day. There was a nice swimming pool and workout center but I didn't use them. My room had a king size bed, mini-refrigerator, microwave, desk with light, TV, dresser, a small table with 2 chairs, closet safe, ironing board with iron, and a blow dryer in the bathroom. The air conditioner is the only thing I think could have been improved upon. It cooled just fine, but didn't have a setting where you could have the fan run constantly along with compressor cutting on and off for cooling. (I like to have constant air movement in the room when I'm sleeping.) If you turned the fan on to run constantly, I believe the A/C part didn't work - it was just fan. I could be wrong. The bed was a little more firm than I care for, but I still slept very well on it. (I'm spoiled at home with a pillow top mattress.) Every morning, they delivered a newspaper in front of my door which was really nice. The breakfast they provided included fresh fruit, a selection of cereals, milk, juice, muffins, cinnamon raisin bread, bagels, biscuits, gravy, and egg patties. The coffee was actually very good and they provided 1/2 & 1/2 in a pitcher versus the dry creamer in packets. There was a rather loud gentleman in the room next to me and I could hear him talking from time to time. Not sure if the walls were a little thin or what. But when the A/C was running, I didn't hear him. My check-in and check-out were quick and efficient. I received exactly what I had reserved at the rate I was quoted. They had a nice comfortable lobby where I could wait for my coworkers each morning. Overall, my experience was great!"
POSITIVE,Finna jump fresh n go get a room at @BestWestern #BossYoLifeUp
POSITIVE,Nice clean spacious room. Poor location.
NEUTRAL,Nice clean room. Ours overlooked a wide flowing river so we had a great view. Breakfast is awesome. So much better than usual free motel breakfast. Made to order bacon eggs toast and juice delivered to your table on actual dishes by a nice waitress. Two disappointments; Â gym without a treadmill. And although only 4 miles to downtown Boston in morning rush hour it took 45 minutes.
POSITIVE,"It was a wonderfull night, the person are very nice on the Rezeption. And the Shuttle Bus to Douwntown are super service. All in won when you like to have a good Hotel with good Price you must Sleep in the Best Western!!"
POSITIVE,Very nice new hotel close to the casino in Thackerville. Would recommend and would stay there again.
POSITIVE,"Having been previously disappointed by best western hotels, especially those in the UK, i was reluctant to stay here. however after a mix up with work dates and meeting i found myself needing a Scottsdale hotel at short notice so gave it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised - they are obviously going for the boutique feel with the rooms, mine had a jacuzzi tub in the middle of the bedroom. great staff very helpful with good recommendation for place to eat nearby. lots of things within easy walking distance also. Only real complaint was that aircon unit was very noisy - upgrade this and it will be a 5 rating!"
NEGATIVE,"When we arrived at the hotel it took them 45 minutes just to find our reservation, which put us 45 minutes behind going to our destination. On our way back from our destination(heinz field) our ""complementary"" shuttle never showed up despite repeated phone calls to the hotel. Overall, the service was terrible and I then had to pay a taxi since no oneÂ ever showed up in the shuttle."
POSITIVE,Very clean comfy rooms and the staff was so friendly and helpful!
NEGATIVE,"The room wasn't ready when I came to check in even though it was after check in time. There is construction everywhere that is loud and dirty. However, the worst part was how filthy the room was. It was non smoking but had obviously been a smoking room in the past because it was yellowed and dingy with smoke. There were crumbs between the beds, someone else's pill box was poking out from underneath the bed, the notepad they left had coffee rings on it, the Customer survey dried coffee spilt all over it! The decorative pillows had grime and stains on them. One bed felt damp, the other had black hairs all in the sheets when I pulled back the covers. The bathroom tile was covered in mildew/mold. The water was only scalding hot, the cold did not work at all. I could not even take a shower. The room had a smell. There were fruit flies milling around (I have no idea where they came from). There is a 1/4"" gap around the door so you can hear everyone outside as if they were in your room. The free internet didn't work, and I was told to call a helpline who said they would call me back and never did. I was barely able to sleep. I was hesitant to eat somewhere where the rooms were so disgusting but I did want juice so I went to the breakfast. They were out of OJ and the apple juice was disgustingly watered down. There was just a vat of scrambled eggs, with the scooper in an ice bucket and a vat of sausage I think. Maybe the ""good"" breakfast is only on the weekends? The pool is tiny. The hallways are dark. The man at the front desk in the morning was very pleasant but I didn't even have the energy to tell him how horrible the experience was. I cannot believe they actually rented that room to me. I doubt the cleaning person even changed the sheets. I am disgusted The only positive: I did not see signs of bedbugs (fingers crossed I did not pick any up)"
POSITIVE,"My only real adverse comment is the price of the room. At $300 per night accepting it's in an expensive area, I felt over the top.There are rooms cheaper at about $200 I understand.However, if price is not a great factor in your descisions then this is a great place to stay for a few days. The room I had was on the front of the property overlooking the Ocean. There was also a small patio to take in the sunset.The service was excellent, however the building was quite old and sound proofing was not great. The room was of a good size with a fireplace. There is a good restaurant within walking distance where you can eat outside if you wish. Accross the road are walkways along the cliff top although no access to the beach at that point. Hearst Castle is only 6 miles away.Breakfast is included and is average continental.Nice pool heated and good furniture."
NEUTRAL,"Although this hotel was in a convenient location for seeing Jacksonville, we were not impressed with the general cleanliness of the rooms. The original room was so musty smelling that they had placed a humidifier, running full-blast, in the room. Even after requesting a change and being moved to a new room, we were not overly impressed with the 'clean' feel of the carpets, etc. I guess we got what we paid for..."
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed my stay, and I liked having my Dog with Me"
POSITIVE,"We stayed there on a chance during family travels to pick up a puppy in Kentucky. We stopped there @ 12:30am and surprisingly someone was at the front desk and anxiously awaiting to help us. We stopped at 2 hotels before this one, i had to ring bell and yell for someone to tell me they didn't have the room i needed. I stayed in room 312 and checked out on July 8th after a waffle for breakfast and a quick swim for the kids and the hot tub for the wife and I. Definitely recommend!!!! Thank you from the Brown Family!!!"
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is at best a 2 star hotel. Not bad for a 2 star but far from a 3 star. Staff was pleasant and the room was in fair condition, and met basic needs. I didn't try the pool but it looked fine. My room had double beds, I found these to be uncomfortable and a bit small for a 6 foot guy. Furniture in the rooms was a bit worn but functional. I did dislike the serious lack of outlets and was wishing I'd brought a power bar (lamps and alarm clock, etc, use up most outlets). My son got bug bites and it would appear to be from his bed ( he didn't say anything til after we left). I slept terribly on the bed, perhaps me not the bed but double is too small for 6'1"" man. Internet wireless worked OK, but a little slow and would drop occassionally. The breakfast was a real disappointment, as I said the staff was nice but the breakfast was crowded, had only dry goods, no eggs, bacon, sausage, just toast, cereal, waffles, coffee. Personally I'll never stay at a best western again ( I'd previous had better experiences, not great but ok, than this, but I won't risk quality again), but that is just me. Hopeful this helps you decide if this hotel will meet your needs."
POSITIVE,"Good food at restaurant The heating?cooling components were very filthy, thus causing a bad smell of burning dirt when heat was on. The unites need cleaning badly...not good."
POSITIVE,"Clean, recently updated, and convenient. Great restaurant next door offers traditional NY deli lunches but also great breakfasts and terrific service. Pros: Spotless. Location: Easy on and off 101. Just 15 minutes to the Marina in SFO."
POSITIVE,"Despite the slightly faded exterior, this hotel came up trumps. We are a family of 4 (5 if you include the dog). I have nothing to complain about. The rroom was large and clean.The staff friendly and helpful. We had room service and the food was delicious. Similarly in the morning, the breakfast was just perfect. Thanks to all the staff for a very pleasant stay. ."
NEUTRAL,"We were staying here to be near Disney. Shuttles were okay, but very crowded during busy times and did not always arrive at the scheduled time. The pool at the hotel was okay...nothing fancy. The food at the restaurant was mediocre bar-typefood. But, it served its purpose for us, since we were out most of the time at the Disney Parks. Good location overall, easy walk to Downtown Disney."
POSITIVE,Free Parking
NEGATIVE,"Gross, dirty, rooms had bugs and service was terrible! Charged our debit card 3 times. I could go on forever about how terrible our stay was!"
NEGATIVE,"It was late when we checked in, ready to crash. The first thing we noticed was a heavy chlorine pool smell at 12:30am in the lobby. We checked into Room 219A, the room was filled with chlorine fumes. We turned on the AC, hoping the smell would disappear. During the night I woke up to the smell of chlorine several times. The next morning after taking a shower we noticed the tile floor was dirty. We had planned on staying an additional day.. but decided to transfer to a different hotel. We told the desk clerk the next morning, she said someone must have left the pool door open. Oh, also the next morning we noticed our room was over the indoor pool area! Advise, don't stay in room 219A!"
POSITIVE,"The Best Western Inn at The Buffalo Airport is conveniently located to the thruway and is literally a 2 minute ride to the airport. I had several minor complaints...face towels were not replaced when room was cleaned. I did ask the laundry person directly for the towels and was told he would deliver them when they were done drying. I never got them.Â Also, the bath tub stopper was broken. I prefer a bath, but the shower did suffice. Breakfast could have included a few more items. On the Pro side, I got into town early and the front desk was kind enough to let me check in 3 hours early. Really appreciated that!"
POSITIVE,"I liked it as well as my wife and kids.We would stay again right there on beachfront,nice view. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location"
POSITIVE,"I stayed in this hotel over the Labor Day weekend. The room was a King suite. It was very large and nicely appointed. There was a 42 inch flat screen TV, and a sitting area. It included a pillow top bed. The hotel breakfast was awesome. Room Tip: Reserve a King suite. Very spacious."
POSITIVE,"There are some pretty bad reviews of this place online, but honestly its a great hotel. Its DATED not Dirty. Brown is not an attractive, en vouge, colour, but my room was clean and comfortable. Great Location. I thought it was a great value."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel advertises a pool and fitness room. The Fitness room was barred, the men's changeroom was off-limits and the temperature in the pool room was below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The rest of the hotel was over-heated. The handles were coming off the dresser in the room. If we had to stay in Albany any longer than just the one night we would have changed hotels."
POSITIVE,"Clean, affordable and perfectly located in Napa. It had high end furnishings and the staff was warm and welcoming. Pros: Furnishings"
NEUTRAL,Room was fine. Can not believe how small the toilet was. Very uncomfortable and short. Hard for a bigger person to get up from. Must change to a standard size. No newspaper on the weekends or on Memorial Monday. Bed was nice. TV channels- Showtime andHBO and Show2 were avery weak signal with lines and distortions
POSITIVE,"My family and I stayed one night on a layover and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and helpful -- they even made arrangements to get us back to the airport in the morning. The location was fantastic -- only two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and a block from the Cable Car. We were able to pack in a meal at the wharf, a boat ride to the Golden Gate Bridge, a ride on a cable car and a visit to China Town topped off with Dim Sum before walking back (downhill all the way - yay) to the hotel. Even squeezed in a 4.0 earthquake in the morning. The room was clean, quiet and reasonably priced. What else could one ask for? If I had to make a tiny complaint -- they could improve the signage in the halls as there was some construction going on in the lobby that made some exits unpassable and made it a bit of a challenge to find our way out the first time. Otherwise, great hotel! Room Tip: Our room had an interior view of a small courtyard and likely contributed to the quietness of our st..."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here with my husband and 3 teenaged sons in July on our way to Yellowstone. It was a pleasant stay all around. The hotel is fairly new or else newly renovated. We were treated well by the staff. The rooms were nice, clean and had plenty of space for the 5 of us (two queen beds in the bedroom and a fold-out sofa in the living room of the suite). We enjoyed the indoor pool and ate at the Restaurant next door (pizza and pasta, etc - very good but a little crowded). I would recommend this to anyone passing through Missoula and for a longer stay as well Pros: Close restaurants Free Internet"
NEUTRAL,"Maybe because it was off season, but this Best Western did not impress me. It is a property in need of investment and upgrades. To start there where no warm cookies at check in - as many other Best Western's offer...sure it's a little thing, but it makes for a warm welcome. The pool in this hotel is very nice, however, it results in a subtle smell of chlorine throughout the lobby and halls. The hot tub could have been better tended, there was grit (sand?) in it and the water levels low. The pool towels they give out at the front desk were not pool sized and very coarse. The towels in the bathroom where also a disappointment, no soft or fluffy to be found. The in room coffee maker has not been upgraded, it is still a make a pot model. There are precious few power outlets, again a simple upgrade to bring power plugs up to the nightstand and desk. The wireless internet was reliable and strong. There was no blanket on the bed, just a comforter over the sheet...odd. The heating system was annoying at best, I ended up shutting it off, with better results than the loud fan that left me roasting or chilly. Overall this property is just not up to the chains standard. The location is awesome and would be the only reason I'd consider staying here again. Room Tip: Away from the ice maker!!"
POSITIVE,Sitting room plus sleeping area. Seemed to be a recent remodel. Good staff. Breakfast was fine. We were happy to be off of 95 and on quieter Hwy 1. Only negative was the lack of elevators.
POSITIVE,"The motel was as expected, neat, clean, and attractive. It was within walking distance to eating and entertainment locations."
POSITIVE,"Spent a weekend in San Diego wanting to experience something other than Zoo and Sea World. Found the Best Western Seven Seas to be a nice central location to the different sites we planned on visiting. Checking in was smooth, being as I had already paid in advance. However, without asking I was upgraded to one of their suite rooms with no additional cost - this was much appreciated. The room was nice, clean and spacious with two rooms and two bathrooms. Inside the ""bedroom"" was the smallest ""Queen"" sized bed I'd seen, but it was still big enough for me (6 ft. tall) and my wife. The bed was pretty hard ... after the second night our bodies were beginning to feel pretty soar. Overall we felt pretty comfortable in the room and would definitely stay there again. Room Tip: Become a member of their Rewards program."
POSITIVE,"This Best Western was awesome! Do not let the exterior fool you. Yes, it looks like they are in the middle of a ship yard (well, they sort of are) but inside is all renovated, attractive, warm and cozy! Our room was on the 4th floor facing the bay. It was very quiet and the view is beautiful. The shipyard is off to the right and at sunset, I walked along the path walkway behind the hotel that runs along the bay. The staff is very nice and the breakfast was one of the best. My husband teaches workshops around the country so we stay at economical medium-rated hotels and this one is the best. Breakfast had waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, yogurt, cereals, muffins, juices, hot chocolate, coffee... etc. It was great. Wish I had room to eat all. I just had the waffle and a yogurt. Room was super clean including the bathroom which was sparkling... not kidding. We had no problems with the air conditioner unit like other reviewer. But we like 'white noise' when we sleep."
POSITIVE,"I was very surprised with this hotel. I didn't expect it to be nearly as nice as it was. Great breakfast buffet. The only bad thing I found was our room smelled strange, but everywhere else was fine. The odor wasn't so bad that you couldn't stay in there, you got used to it after a short time. Very convenient to everywhere we wanted to go. We orderedÂ a pizza from Parma Pizza just down the road, and it was SO good! Would recommend the hotel to anyone and while you're there, you should try a pizza!"
NEGATIVE,"The morning lady at the front dest was great Yhe room had stains ond covers and curtains,,,Not a clean room at all."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was very friendly, house keeping personnel were very helpful, as well as front desk. Breakfast was good, room was clean, a few ants, nothing to be scared about. Pros: Very friendly, conveniently located between two major malls, safe surroundings. Cons: The room was not ready, couldÂ´t find confirmation done thru internet, had to call by phone."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was one of the cleanest and most comfortable I have ever been in. I went with myself and my 3 kids and we all had a blast. The kids loved the pool and I loved the amazingly comfortable beds!! The complimentary breakfast in the morning was unlike anything I had ever seen before...amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone...single, couples or families!"
POSITIVE,"This is not the Ritz Carlton, nor is it the Beverly Wilshire - it's a Best Western, but I give it four stars because my two room King suite was spacious, well appointed, tastefully decorated, clean and quiet. I've paid quite a bit more for quite abit less at many a hotel and found this place to be an excellent value, especially considering the free parking and breakfast. Also, the towels were pretty fluffy and thick. I had a third floor room facing the courtyard | pool, near the center. Two elevators, one in the lobby and one at the back. I gave the location three stars only because it's in a business park and most of the restaurants are a short drive (instead of walking distance). All in all - a pleasant stay. I'd come back."
POSITIVE,Stayed at the Tuscan Inn 9/17-9/19/2011 because it allowed us to explore the Fisherman's Wharf area while we were in SF for a couple of days. Room was bright and we were able to open the windows to enjoy the breezes from the Bay. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean and adequately appointed. Only snag was that we promised robes but none were in the room when we checked in. A quick call to the front desk had the robes delivered within 20 minutes. The attached restaurant was more than adequate for breakfast and even dinner if you so desired. Room Tip: We took a suite because we like to spread out and if one wakes up early there is another 'space...
POSITIVE,"The room was very clean, the first thing we did was inspect the room for bedbugs & did not find a trace of them. The bed was comfortable for me, but my husband thought it was too soft for him. The only small complaint was the coffee in the room was more like colored water. We just went over to the breakfast room & the coffee was great there. Our familyÂ members stayed at another hotel in the area. When they saw our rooms, they were a little disappointed that they didn't book with us."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I had a wonderful 4 nights at the Best Western in Alton, Illinois. As we were departing, I summed it up by telling the front desk people that our stay was ""comfortable, clean, and quiet."" The ladies who clean and prepare rooms also appreciated being complimented. They were very kind and helpful. Location: Add another C - convenient"
NEGATIVE,"The room was vary cramped and a whole lot shoved into a small room. Room was dark also. The a/c would either be stuck on freezing or hot. I am a big guy over 6 foot 6 tall, and it was hard to move around in the room or bathroom. Also there was not a whole lot of good parking by the hotel. The good thing was it is really close to the waterfront and couldÂ walk up and down the waterfront."
NEUTRAL,"Can't beat the location to the Albermarle airport. Wi fi is iffy in the rooms, but you can sit in the lobby to access. rooms are fine, didn't take advantage of much else. Great mexican restaurant just down the road where a lot of locals were eating dinner."
POSITIVE,"OK for our purpose. Hockey tournament in the area. Clean, comfortable. Passable continental breakfast. Pros: Convenient to shopping and ice arena. Cons: Confrontational female hotel greeter. Refused to help until owner intervened."
POSITIVE,"This motel has great location, friendly and helpful staff, easy access off main HW . Would definitely recommend it to fellow travellers."
POSITIVE,Bon petit dÃ©jeuner
POSITIVE,good quality hotel
POSITIVE,"This is a very nice hotel/motel. Booking was easy. It was easy to locate...just off the hwy. The grounds were nicely maintained. You can pull in under a covered walkway to enter the lobby for checking in. Nice, it was raining a little when I arrived. Check-in was quick and the clerk was polite and welcoming. I had no problem finding my room or parkingÂ due to the helpful assistance of the clerk. The room was clean and nicely appointed with a chair and ottoman, large flat screen television that swiveled, A desk, multiple lamps, comfortable bed with several pillows. It also had a microwave and a nice sized refrigerator that you could actually put larger items in! I was pleasantly surprised that I found the shower and curtain clean. I'm sure I'm not the only person who checks the shower curtain! I was only there for 1 night but because I hardly ever use a motel...I prefer the indoor rooms...this was a very nice surprise. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this one again."
POSITIVE,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel, and were very pleased with it. We had my 94 year old mother in the room next door and she was also very pleased, except with her stringent breakfast requirements. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The bed was exceptional. The staff were very friendly and attentive. As far as we were concerned there were only 2 negatives. Each room has a coffee maker, which is not good for making tea. They took about 50 minutes to get the water hot enough to make coffee or tea, and did not get it hot enough to add milk. I enquired about a kettle or jug, but they did not have one, so it meant making the tea, adding milk, and putting it back into the pot and wait another 15 minutes, so having a cup of anything took at least an hour. At least they did have refrigerators in the room. The second was the onsite Restaurant. We travel a lot, and this was our 20th World trip, each over a month, so are well used to hotels. It is an Italian Restaurant , and the food seemed fine, but not everyone wants to eat Italian all the time, and there was nothing else on the menu. The breakfast was served there, and it was a la cart, with a fairly limited range, but the pricing was good for what they had. This made getting breakfast a slow process, not getting what you actually wanted. On the last day, we found the Restaurant at the Marriot, about 150m down the road, this was a full buffet and was excellent, but a bit more expensive, so we were annoyed that we only noticed in time to have one dinner and the breakfast there the next morning. Both were excellent, the breakfast was a bit more expensive, but a lot more varied. As far as the hotel went, we were very pleased, except the minor problem of making tea. They were happy to bring a jug of hot water on request, but that was out of their coffee maker, so not exceptionally hot, and the San Francisco water is very chlorinated, where pure water was $3/gallon at the nearby 7-11. The free Wi Fi was very appreciated."
POSITIVE,I rented the oversize two queen beds room and it was very spacious and clean.It also had a refrigerator and microwave. The distance to Cannery Raw was about 15 to 20 minutes walking. The hotel also has a computer in the lobby that has access to internet. There is plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. It is about 5 minutes from Downtown Monterey. It was a little bit prizey but cheaper than a 5 star hotel. The staff is friendly. Parking is in the basement and it has two levels. Access is by elevator so if there is a handicapped traveler you will have no problems. I rated it 4/5 overall. .
NEGATIVE,"Accidentally booked for a Sunday night instead of Saturday night. Asked front desk if they could change my reservation, they said no. Then I asked if I could cancel it, and they said no."
POSITIVE,"Room was clean, staff was nice, breakfast was okay. Beautiful harbor view. Some strange noises at night (traffic, pipes??)."
NEUTRAL,"just an Ok motel I wouldn't stay there longer than one night. There is Hampton Suites across the street where we stayed for 2 nights and it is much-much better quality. Pros: noth much to highlight Cons: noisy Location: San Jose, CA"
NEUTRAL,"This is a recently acquired hotel for Best Western, so it is going through a bit of transition to include new beds, remodeled bathrooms and new sheets & towels. Unfortunately, the colors of the carpet, drapes and bedspread are not appealing-mostly reds and browns. The furniture is old and tired. I am hopeful they will do a total remodel of the rooms in the near future. The best part of my stay was the breakfast. Typically, a BW breakfast is self service and just average, but this hotel offers a full service breakfast from the hotel's restaurant with excellent service. You receive a $5 voucher that can be used towards a a free continental breakfast or full hot breakfast that compares to some of the best I have ever had. I paid a difference of $2.50 for this upgrade. I know BW typically includes a breakfast with your stay, but this was much better in my opinion. I hope they keep this restaurant open and continue to offer this perk for my next stay. Room Tip: Ask for a quiet room away from the 101 freeway"
NEUTRAL,"The hotel was very nice. I booked a king room but when we went into the room it was set up as a conference room. We ended up in a queen handicap room because there were no other king rooms available. The room was nice and we did get a discount for being put in a different room. I was not impressed with the information that the hotel offered. There wasÂ no ""binder"" with local resturants, attractions, movie channels etc. Also, there was only one small sign in the breakfast area that said when breakfast was and we ended up missing it almost every morning. The last morning we were there my boyfriend went down to see what they had while I packed and he said that it was some packaged donuts and other cold breakfast stuff nothing that great. The pool area was nice and the hot tub was very nice. My only complaint was that the tile on the wall of the hot tub was falling off and there was sand in the bottom of the hot tub. Overall, the hotel was honestly very nice and was about half an hour from Cedar Point. I would definately stay there again!!!!"
POSITIVE,Very close to Stone Mountain...great location...nice and clean.
POSITIVE,"Good value and well located. Associated with Kimpton Hotels, which attracted our attention."
POSITIVE,"We just spent two nights with our friends (who have a daughter at Gettysburg College) at the Best Western in Gettysburg and it was a great location for touring this historic city. It's located right on Lincoln Square which is in the center of everything. It was within easy walking distance of lots of interesting little shops and there were plenty of great places to stop and grab a bite to eat. The hotel and rooms were clean and very comfortable and the staff was friendly and professional. We had a problem with our shower our first day but we told them at the front desk and it was fixed within an hour. I read in some of the reviews that people were complaining about paying to park downtown. If you're a guest at the hotel you have unlimited access to the city parking garage located directly behind the hotel included in your stay, all you have to do is have the front desk validate your parking ticket before getting your car. All-in-all, this is a great place to stay when you visit Gettysburg and we'll be staying there again the next time we visit this piece of American history. Room Tip: Ask for a room on the fifth or sixth floor to get away from the traffic noise below."
NEUTRAL,the staff was rude and they did not seem to care if the guests were happy or not--- will not stay there again.
POSITIVE,good location on hotel circle near the fashion valley mall. The rooms are SMALL and will fit TWO PEOPLE MAYBE THREE. Overall it was ok but the bathroom was small and not as clean as I had hoped but I still had a great time
POSITIVE,"I had an overall enjoyable experience at the Rockville Best Western. I needed a bowl and spoon, but because it was not the morning there were only spoons available. I think it would be nice to have the basic food service pieces (bowls, spoons, forks, plates, knives) available."
NEUTRAL,"I took a solo trip to pick up my daughter at college in Irvine, and decided to stay near Disneyland, since we were planning to spend some time there before heading home to Northern CA. This was one of the few area hotels we hadn't tried yet, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to give it a whirl. Especially with prices like $78/night! I've decided I like staying on this end of the parks more than across the street on Harbor, because a walk through the Grand Californian and Downtown Disney is much more pleasant and magical than a trek through the Harbor mess. It's a bit farther to walk, but I'll take the distance for the nice atmosphere. This hotel has recently been upgraded and the rooms are stylish, comfortable and well-equipped. My room had a stale-smoke smell that seemed leftover from years of people having smoked in it, but it wasn't awful. The air conditioning/heating units are in a very strange place (above the bathroom vanity area) but have a remote control so you can operate them from your bed. Mine, however, didn't work. Wireless internet service was free, but a bit slow. I had to call the front desk to get the password. They hadn't told me when I checked in. There was a microwave and a fridge and a coffee pot, as well as a blow dryer and iron and ironing board. Tons of storage space was available and there were plenty of hangers in the wardrobe. The windows were all operational, but when opened, the noise was a bit much. I was on the third floor with a view of Paradise Pier at California Adventure. Parking was $8/night, and you had to have a ticket with you at all times to get your car in and out of the lot. Breakfast was free, but pretty bad. Juice, coffee, stale danish, cereal, donuts and hot items (like rubbery french toast sticks and biscuits and gravy). I don't need a lot in the morning, but I would've liked some muffins or bagels or yogurt, perhaps. I felt fairly safe being there myself, but the neighborhood could feel a little dicey if you walked the wrong direction. I thought I'd like the kitschy topiary garden and pool area (a leftover from the 60s) but looking at it from my window was just a tiny bit creepy, I must admit. I've never seen so MANY topiaries in such a small space before! There were two hot tubs, which is nice, but having to run outside a ways to use them and then sit in them alone in that creepy topiary area in the parking lot on a cold night didn't appeal to me. I also noticed there was a nice toddler pool available and a weird ""space age"" bathroom in a bubble-shaped building by the pools. All in all, I'd say it was a nice place for the money and a VERY good alternative for a budget-conscious family who doesn't mind a 15-minute stroll to the parks."
POSITIVE,This hotel was a fantastic value for the dollar. A great stop over while on the way south of the border. You can always rely on Best Western.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was perfect, very close to lake front and Soldier Field! Pros: Quiet"
NEUTRAL,"Yes, I believe this hotel is a good price for their amentities, free wi-fi, large clean rooms with refrig. etc. but the drawback for me, was that it was a little outdated, the overall room was in need of some upkeep especially in the bathroom area, which had a very old jacuzzi tub. The television was old also. The room was comfortable and the bed was also. We could park right in front of our door which was a plus. As for the shuttle they say that goes to the casinos, well we asked twice and they seemed as though it was an inconvience to go over to them so we never asked again and drove to the downtown area ourselves. Also, I had 2 gift cards and when I went to use them at checkout the staff did not know how to apply them. They had to leave for manager to do at another time as this was a Sunday and he was not on premise. It was applied at a later date. All in all it was an average stay."
NEGATIVE,"My sister reserved two rooms at the McComb, MS location in April, for one night. At checkout, I decided to pay for one of the rooms, but wanted to pay cash. The hotel clerk (possibly a family member of the owner) asked for my credit card. I asked why he needed my credit card for a cash transaction at check-out, but didn't get a satisfactory answer. It made no sense to me, but I provided it anyway and asked for assurance that my card would be credited back for any charges. He said yes, then gave me the receipt for the cash transaction which showed a zero balance. My sister paid for the other room. The problem is, he gave her a duplicate of the receipt he'd given me for the room I'd paid for. Later, when the amount was charged to my card, and after I'd provided my card provider a copy of the cash receipt, the hotel owner claimed that my sister had not paid for the other room, and that the charge to my card covered it. Even after I faxed a copy of her bank statement showing the debit from her account, proving that the hotel had been paid three times for two rooms, they claimed that the debit to her account wasn't their transaction. The owner, Andy Patel, has been combative with me, my sister, and even my bank's representatives when we've spoken to him. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. I will tell everyone who listens, about my bad experience with this hotel and it's owner. Their accomodations don't justify what they charge, anyway."
POSITIVE,The overall stay was great. The cleaning staff was awesome. The only thing I would I didn't care for was the mattress and the pillows. But nothing you can't handle. Just bring your own pillow. The Denny's is next door as well as a liquor store and other restaurants. I would recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,Good place for the price
NEGATIVE,"The ONLY reason to stay here is if you're overnighting it in HNL prior to heading out to another island. It's not a dump, it's just dated. Â I had a corner room on Â the top floor so it was probably as good as you could get in this hotel... the room was a good size with a king bed. Â Not much street noise since we were at the back, but definitely plane noise. Â The bathrooms are ugly and the rooms have older mattresses and TVs. The price is steep for what you get - it's $120/night and wired internet in the rooms is free. Â Complimentary hotel shuttle to/from HNL and it runs every 30 mins all day/night. Â Shuttle drivers were nice. Â Basic service at check-in/out. FYI - the info on some of the brochures is outdated... there is NO free breakfast anymore! Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant... very greasy spoon-ish with Hawaiian features like portugese sausages and white rice as sides. Â Items are about $9-12 each. Totally overpriced for what you get, but it's the price you pay for convenience to HNL."
NEGATIVE,"We booked this because of shuttle from airport and called from the airport kiosk of hotels upon arrival. We got another Best Western but told them of our reservation and they said ""Oh, the shuttle stops at 10:00p.m."" (it was 11:00 p.m.). So, we paid for a taxi only to discover that the shuttle didn't stop until midnight! But our hotels.com reservationÂ did not have a phone number on the printout! When we got to the hotel, there was a huge crowd of people checking in for several rooms and the second man on the front desk up and left in the middle of it saying his shift was over!! The kicker though, was the $12 charge for the hot breakfast buffet EACH PERSON when both the website and in-room book about the hotel said it was complementary!! There was no sign in the breakfast area about the charge, nor did the girl signing us in for breakfast say anything about any charges! Some guests were irate -- we just paid and left and would not stay there again!"
POSITIVE,It was a fantastic hotel room with amazing views during the day and night. The top floor was awesome and loved its location in the city. The free breakfast was also a great perk! I would try and stay here next time I visit San Diego. Loved it all!
POSITIVE,The bike rentals were really close. Just to keep towels better stocked and longer shower curtains. other wise it was a pleasant stay
POSITIVE,"We stayed here on the way to Seattle. Excellent check in and breakfast. Rooms were large and clean. Bathroom fan was very noisy. Overall, a little too far from the town, which is a quaint town with an excellent pub."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is close to the airport but also easy access to surrounding malls and restaurants. the staff were extremely helpful however, the breakfast menu and the choice of food in the restaurant was not up to the other high standard. All in all I would stay there again."
POSITIVE,The staff
POSITIVE,"Location, reasonable rates."
POSITIVE,"I love this hotel! This is the second time I've stayed there and the staff are excellent, the beds are super comfy, and the location is perfect! The location is great, it is a good walking distance from the bay and also gaslamp area! There is a convenient store right around the corner which is great and the train station is just a short walk from the hotel! I love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed here as a post cruise night before out next day flight. The room was outstanding. Large, modern, large flat screen TV (w/HBO), free wifi, decent gym, and a great breakfast (included - though I wasn't expecting it). You stay here for the proximity to the airport (very handy with 1/2 hour shuttle trips). The employees are very friendly and helpful.Â Thumbs up to Best Western on this one ~"
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at many hotels in the Disneyland resort area and was very impressed by the Stovall's Inn. My room was very clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. I had a flat screen TV, fridge and microwave, nice bedding, and a nice shower with a strong spray. The pool and jacuzzi at the Inn is really nice, though close to the road. They have beautifulÂ animal topiaries around the pool area as well. There is a decent work out room and laundry room on premises. They have a continental breakfast every day that is much better than I expected. The hotel is in a great location - an easy walk to Downtown Disney and the Disney hotels. The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this Inn to anyone visiting the Disneyland resort area."
POSITIVE,"This is a relatively new hotel and great alternative in a town with few satisfactory sleeping facilities. Almost everything was very satisfactory, including the breakfast. The room was apparently very clean, but one trash can was not emptied, and there was a straw cover on the upholstered ottoman. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was great,Â with an excellent shower head and with construction that was not cheap, flexible plastic. Taken as a whole, the experience was very good."
POSITIVE,I stayed at the BEST WESTERN PLUS St. Charles Inn Hotel last week and the customer service was outstanding! If you are looking to save some cash than book it here HotelDealNow.Info I saved like $50 by using that site!
POSITIVE,"The hotel was nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. We rented 2 rooms and brought along our small kids. We enjoyed the pool, warm breakfast and free WiFi. We would definitely come back again. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet"
NEUTRAL,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights in mid-July. The staff was very accomodating. Our second night we could not sleep due to a persistent beeping noise in the hallway. We phoned the front desk around 11 and someone had come up within minutes to figure out the problem. The room was clean and the beds were good, but the air conditioner did not run continuously and the constant shut off/on made the room stuffy at times. The breakfast was packed in the morning and not worth the time or trouble. Others have complained about the thin walls, but we did not have a problem and the place was sold out both nights. No elevator did make things a bit inconvenient as we were traveling with a baby and had several bags to lug in and out."
NEUTRAL,"The location is very good and the room was comfortable. My only issue is that the gym has two treadmills. Neither worked and in the course of a week's stay, nothing was done to fix them."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel for the money, great breakfast. Would recommend and would stay again."
POSITIVE,"I stayed here with my 2 children while in Anaheim for a week. It was a little further from Disneyland than I thought - a good 20 minute walk. Other than that, the hotel was pretty much what I expected and offered good value. The pools were nice, and there was always enough at continental breakfast - though a little more variety from day to day mightÂ have been nice. The air conditioner in the room was a little old and quite loud, but we got used to that. Everything was clean and the staff were friendly."
NEUTRAL,"Bring ear plugs and you'll be fine. It's clean, convenient and includes parking, wifi and happy hour BUT the walls are VERY thin and I heard every bump, thump and footstep."
NEUTRAL,"Before the Best Western was built a few years ago, the only places to stay in Yucca were really yucky (pun intended). This property can be good sometimes, and not so good other times. One time when I experienced a horrible stay, the owner helped to get things resolved to my satisfaction. There are two buildings: the main building, which is hotel style, and the back building, which is suites-style. To get to a room in the main building, one goes past the check in area to get to the elevator. In the back building, there is no one there to watch the comings and goings. As a solo female traveler, I prefer the front building. The back building is great for people who will be staying a longer time, perhaps have a family, want a full refrigerator and some ability to cook. The kitchen supplies are sparse (e.g., one spoon, one fork), etc. The pool is closer to the back building. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the highway."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is in a really good location. Carmel by the Sea is a beautiful place and this was just a short walk to the shops etc. It is about a 20-30 minute walk to the beach and as we were only staying for one night we got up early and walked down there and it was beautiful. The room was spacious and really clean, there was plenty of parking. Breakfast is limited but it was fine and as there are only two tables you can take it back up to your room."
POSITIVE,My experience each night we stayed out the Best Western was absolutely outstanding!! I have no complaints. Everyone was on point. The staff was friendly. I could tell that the owner takes a lot of pride in the hotel because I saw him constantly working on the premises while we were there. Everyone smiled and made my children and I feel at welcomed andÂ at home. I will be going back in the future and would highly recommend The Best Western to anyone who's looking for a home away from home.
POSITIVE,The Best Western was great. The only problem I had was the breakfast area. I'm handcappied & there were stairs & no ramp so I could get down to the eating area. Wish they would fix that problem. Room Tip: Rms. were large & very clean. Very friendly staff.
POSITIVE,"I chose this hotel after arriving in Detroit Lakes midweek, and stayed for three nights. The front desk gave me a very nice deal, considerably cheaper than on-line services were reporting. This is a lake front hotel with all rooms facing Detroit Lake. The rooms are clean and large, the beds comfortable. There is also a nice day spa in the building, at which I enjoyed a nice 60 minutes sports massage. Service was good all around. My only complaint is that the wireless internet was too slow to allow me to watch Netflix on my tablet."
POSITIVE,wonder.roomy.CLEAN>CLEAN>CLEAN highly recommend
POSITIVE,"I used this hotel when in LA on business and stayed 3 nights due to its close proximity to LAX and the fact that our usual accomodation had doubled in price. The most important thing is that it's great value - rooms are spacious and clean, hotel is quiet and as mentioned, only 20 minutes from LAX. Drawbacks are service is very limited with no concierge or luggage assistance availble or offered. Reception staff could do with being a little more informed as they all appeared to be ""whoever was avaialble"" No bar to speak of but you can buy wine and beer at reception or nip round the corner to the drug store for beers and bring back. Will definitely use this hotel again and would live for the service to be more like the standard you get at the Crowne Plaza up the road... Room Tip: 3rd floor at rear of hotel - spacious trooms and very quiet."
POSITIVE,We found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. We unexpectedly arrived a day early and the staff was able to accommadate us even though our reservation wasn't until the next day. Loved Branson and the shows are reasonable and very entertaining.
POSITIVE,Excellent hotel with one of the best breakfast spreads that I have seen. Will definitely be back to this place.
POSITIVE,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this fine establishment. The breakfast was wonderful and the employees were very helpful and kind. Even with the construction you hardly noticed anything. We even made another reservation.
POSITIVE,Quality of hotel was great. Clean and comfortable room with plenty of pillows. Lots of AC outlets which was very convenient. Hot breakfast was welcoming with good varieties. The master bedroom suite had 2 LCD TV which was nice. Surrounding the hotel were lots of restaurants including an Albertson store. My only gripe was the slow internet connection.Â Eventhough they had a 2 separate SSID's but it seemed they limited the transfer speed to around 200Kbps and dropped down quickly. Staff was friendly and helpful. Good enough for business stay.
NEGATIVE,"Service sucks. Point blank, period. The guy up front is beyond rude. I'd stay somewhere else. Liked: Location Disliked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,"Pros: The Lobby is very nice, and convenient to pizza shop. Cons: The location was a little bit scary. I was hoping to get closer to the prime outlet area"
POSITIVE,"I can say this hotel was awesome, this hotel provided all the amenities that another five star hotel will provide, including continental breakfast for free. You can't beat that, not only that the price was reasonable and competitive with surrounding hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody."
NEUTRAL,Hotel and room were clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast worked and the price was affordable no problem staying there again
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very close to the airport, but yet quiet. The free shuttle to the airport was great. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The breakfast area was great, as was the breakfast itself. The room was beautiful--better than I had expected! I would definitely stay at this hotel again should the need arise! Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet Quiet convenient"
NEUTRAL,Very funky place with lots of old English and doggie (dogs) decor. I heard a 10-year-old girl exclaim how beautiful the hotel was. Pros: Great for children because of the Bucaneer Bay aquatic center attached. Cons: The room we had faced the freeway and it was very very noisy.
POSITIVE,"My friend and I booked this hotel having never stayed here before and did not really know what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised. Rooms were very clean. the service and entire staff were very friendly and helpful answering all our questions.. The hotel is right at the trolly stop which worked well for us. We arrived;, parked the car, and never had to move the car until ready for departure which is really nice. We will definitely stay here again when in San Antonio."
POSITIVE,Second stay - would go back -convenient to free tram service to downtown so minimizing need to use our car
POSITIVE,The only complaint I have is we needed to be someplace @ 3:00 p.m. and were not able to check in until about 2:30 p.m. There should be allowances made for those who need a little earlier check-in time. Otherwise - nice experience.
POSITIVE,"Firstly Thank you, Thank you Thank you to the staff. We arrived stressed with our pets after having to evacuated the Monument fire. We had stayed here before at various times over the past four years and this hotel is the best ! This time they bent over backwards to help us out with our elderly pets and breakfast the next moring rocked. Having a fridge and microwave is so great for late night snacking and refreshments. Love this hotel and they rose to the emergency that is ongoing in this area. Good Job Quail Hollow!!!"
POSITIVE,"We got here very late at night, but I'm glad we took an hour in the morning to check out the pool area. It is fabulous! The rooms seemed to be in the process of being updated, but are your standard Best Western rooms. The man at the front desk was very courteous."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I and our two teenagers stayed at this hotel for a weekend. It was our first time at this hotel and believe me it will not be our last. Our room was large with two double beds that were really comfortable. The bathroom was quite large. Everything in our room and the hotel in general was very clean, neat and tidy. It has a main restaurant, a bar and a small cafe. It has valet parking with a rate comparable to local public parking sites. It is within easy walking distance of many good restaurants and shopping. Front desk and other staff that we met were very professional, friendly and helpful. When we checked out Sunday, there was a restuarant charge on the room invoice that we felt was not ours. Front desk staff took down my home phone number and promised to look into it on Monday. On Tuesday, I received a call from Remi at the hotel confirming the additional charge was not ours and that it had since been removed from credit card account. On our next visit to Montreal we will definitely return to this hotel."
POSITIVE,"From the time we arrived we felt that ""Southern Charm"" the hotel was clean&the; staff friendly.Once we were directed to our room I was not sure three adult Women could coexist in a room with two full beds? But we made the best of it, we'er sistersand spent years in tight spaces in our youth. We especially enjoyed the bar/lounge area. Todd&Johnny; were friendly and mixed great drinks. Adding some music ie.Zydeco would be a plus and would encourage other guest to spend time&money; there instead of Burbon St."
POSITIVE,"I had no problems with the room. It was very large with a comfortable king size bed. There was a large bathroom with a very slippery tub. (We bring our own bathmat for just such an emergency.) There was no view but there was lost of foilage to give you something pleasing to look out at from the window. Lots of storage for your things with a refrigerator & microwave. Very easy access to & from I-5. My only thing about this Best Western is that they say they offer a ""full breakfast"". I checked it out & it was only the usual fair of self-serve waffles, cereal, pastries (& not good ones), eggs. Really it was the same as most other places would call a ""continental breakfast"". I know this is petty, but it really bugged me. There also did not seem to be an attendant to re-stock items as needed, but maybe I just missed them. Overall, I would stay here again. The room was excellent & very quiet. After all, that is the most important thing when staying away from home."
NEUTRAL,"Walls were so thin I could not only hear phone conversation of person next door, I could hear the person on the other end!!! Would recommend if primary task is visiting CSU, otherwise, shop around."
POSITIVE,"Great find in San Antonio. We have passed by this hotel many times not knowing it was there. Upon arrival very nice check in experience. Front desk staff very helpful and friendly. The decor and atmosphere of the lobby was very inviting. When we got to our room, very happy that we had selected this hotel. Room and bathroom very clean. King size bed and sitting area comfortable and nicely decorated. The dim lighting added to the ""rustic"" atmosphere of the property. Free parking is a big plus in this area. Most hotels charge extra for parking. Nominal charge for breakfast not a big deal and the breakfast was good. It was about a 2-3 block walk to the Riverwalk. It was a comfortable walk and felt safe even after dark. The only drawback about this hotel is no swimming pool. We like to relax in pool on hot afternoons. The overall appearance and atmosphere of this property truly make it a great hotel. Next time we are looking to stay in downtown San Antonio, this hotel will be on the top of our list of places to stay."
POSITIVE,I stayed this past weekend and no regret.Room given to us was large and very clean.I`ve seen other hotel and by far whatever bad rap they say I donot believe it.Just unhappy people... Room Tip: corner rooms nice and sunny
NEUTRAL,"My husband and I stayed in the king jacuzzi suite the end of July through the beginning of August. The hotel was not too bad, but not great either. Our room looked exactly as it had in the photographs on the hotel website. My complaint was that the water in the jacuzzi looked brown. We always bring Lysol or Chlorox wipes with us to clean everything a second time, but no amount of cleaning the tub changed the color of the water-- there must be some rust in the pipes. So, we did not get to take advantage of the jacuzzi after we paid for it. We enjoyed swimming in the pool. Although it was always extremely crowded in the breakfast room, the breakfast was good. You can make your own bear shaped waffles. Aside from the problem with the jacuzzi, the room was very clean. We enjoyed our stay. However, with that being said, we are staying somewhere else for our upcoming trip to the Smokies. Room Tip: I wouldn't recommend the king jacuzzi suite, as ours had brown water-- the pipes must be rusty."
POSITIVE,"The room was clean and tidy and even though it was very small, it had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Bed, table & chairs, refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, shampoo & body soap, and hairdryer. For the price, I can't complain. Very good overall rating on the continental breakfast as well."
POSITIVE,"My daughter and I stayed at the Blue Sea Lodge for a week in late December 2010. The front desk staff were very friendly and helped us with anything we needed. We asked them about bus routes, directions and we asked them for recommendations for places to eat. Their recommendations were fantastic, they really knew the area! It was also very nice to have warm cookies every evening in the lobby to greet us after a long fun-filled day. I would also like to mention their personnal transportation services, we were driven to our whale excursion and to the airport by the transportation service and it was a nice ride. The driver talked with us and told us about the area; he even took us on a scenic route so we could see some of the city scenery. The area that the hotel is in is a great place with manly affordable resturants and a lot of souvenior shops on the board walk. The boardwalk and beach is literally right outside the hotel and the Crystal Pier is a short walking distance. We watched the sunset everynight from the pool area or from just outside the hotel. We booked a partial ocean view room and the view from our hotel room was fantastic, it exceeded our expectations greatly. My daughter and I enjoyed our trip a lot and with the hotel staff`s help, we have memories that will last forever! We have recommended the hotel to all of our friends and family. If/when we are able to come back, we will definetly stay with them again."
POSITIVE,This hotel is a little bit out of the way but was exceptionally clean and the staff was very friendly and professional. It was well worth going out of the way to stay here. The items offered at the continental breakfast were fresh and plentiful. We hope to return to this hotel and the beautiful area.
POSITIVE,"Nothing exceptional about the room, even with 2 dogs. The breakfast was exceptional. the pool shallow end was 3Ft, so not ideal for our 2 and 3 yr olds."
POSITIVE,Pros: Only a few blocks from Broadway where a lot of the bars and other attractions are downtown. Cons: The parking...you had to valet your car.
POSITIVE,"To be near the beach economically, this is about as good as it gets. Pros: I loved the location near the beach & dunes. Cons: Breakfast area gets very crowded by 8:30. All tables may be taken."
NEGATIVE,"As a woman traveling alone I was uncomfortable staying there. Not a real good part of town, I arrived late in the evening & the only room left available even with reservations was the end ground floor room.Hotel needs to be updated, the room was clean enough for the age but in my opinion not worth what I spent or expected. The desk clerk was reallyÂ nice. I was warned about the trains, you're right by the tracks so be aware."
NEUTRAL,"Parking was expensive, location couldn't have been better. Easy access to all bus lines, and cable cars. Close walk to all piers! They did not clean our room for two days, we had to ask them to replace coffee, and for fresh towels. The concierge was very helpful, as we're all other employees there."
POSITIVE,"These folks were the best. They knew the area and where we could go to see the Marfa Lights. It was clean and quiet. The breakfast was just great. Cindy, the cook, made your eggs, omelet, or pancakes to order. I will stay there if I'm ever in Alpine again."
POSITIVE,"My girlfriend and I stayed here, but were given a room with two double beds. Not to mention we could hear everything through the walls at this place, we had two very loud occupants on either side of us and could hear everything they were saying."
POSITIVE,"Christopher at the front desk was both very friendly and helpful in all the questions I threw at him! I am glad he recommmended the Salt and Pepper restaurant next door as the meal was fabulous. The waiter who served me (I think he said he was part owner) was also very friendly and courteous!! When I got there, all the shopping was closed for the evening (too early for Vancouver!!) but I did do a little walking around. I was only there for the one night!!! Because I couldn't open the window (too much noise from the street) I had to use the air conditioner which I always find are way to noisey to get a comfortable sleep!!"
POSITIVE,"Great stay, central location,very clean, friendly staff, great rates!!"
POSITIVE,Staff was awesome and the room was very nice. It was great being so close to the Fisherman's Wharf
POSITIVE,It was just in the middle from the Pavillion at Queen Elisabeth Park und the ubc Golfcourse were we had to be for my sons wedding.I Also liked the little smokergarden since I am a smoker .
POSITIVE,We chose to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary in San Francisco and the Tuscan Inn was very kind in sending up a bottle of bubbly to help us celebrate. They were also very helpful in booking us reservations and tickets on the vast amount of activites to partake in. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to San Francisco and can not wait to come back. TheÂ room was quaint but spacious and very comfortable. The hotel's location was perfect for us. We will be back.
POSITIVE,Nice place to stay for the value. Hotel appears to be fairly new and well maintained.
NEUTRAL,"Lobby, Hallways, & Elevator all were warm to hot.... No air conditioning or not working. My room after 2 hours was not getting cool... air not working properly. Called front desk, very fast and helpful, switch me to a different room, and the air worked fine in that room. First room had broken head board, TV remote missing battery cover... replacement room only some of the channels on the TV worked.The staff all seemed friendly and helpful ! But I think this place is owned/managed by someone very cheap... because they claimed the place has be remodeled... But it looks like it still is need of lots more because either the remodeling was very cheaply done, or was not done.NOT impressed with the facility at all, Staff was great."
POSITIVE,I Stayed here for business on the west side of LA this is a nice clean establishment. It can be very loud outside but the room had triple windows and when closed it was very quiet. Very nice staff and very clean and convenient self park. You can get anywhere from here but have to drive a bit to eat and shop - really no problem. Would recommend.
POSITIVE,"Our stay was excellent from beginning to end, especially the staff, very curtious and helpful in all ways. Rooms were great and clean. Would recommend this hotel to family and anyone else. We plan on staying here whenever we come to the city."
NEUTRAL,"Hotel was older. No breakfast but had an IHOP next door. Far from the beach but the price was right for this area. Had a loud exhaust fan, should have complained and asked for a new room."
NEUTRAL,Convenient to outlet mall and a variety of restaurants. Motel is older and in need of updating. Second floor had musty smell and bed was very firm.
POSITIVE,"We had a great time, the location of this hotel was awesome! Within walking distance from Wharf in San Fran. I would stay at this hotel again, and would recommend the hotel to anyone stay in San Fran. Thank you so much"
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable, clean and quiet. The breakfast was perfect! Clean, well kept, attended, and choices."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here for 4 nights in June while visiting Yellowstone. We had a king room which was large, clean, but aged. Being on the ground floor I found it noisy - but of course that depended greatly upon the people living above and beside you. We were also across from the pool which added to the noise factor. My major complaint about the hotel would be the ridiculous hour that breakfast was served - 07:00. I found this an incredibly late time of the day, especially if you wanted to venture out early into the park. If they started serving an hour earlier then the smaller breakfast area might not be so much of a problem. And if you say why not eat at McD - well we tried that too unsuccessfully - don't get me started on the problems with the McDonalds in town! As for the hotel, I am not sure whether or not I would return for another stay. Room Tip: Make sure you ask for the top floor."
POSITIVE,"Staff friendly, helpful. Hotel clean. Perfect location. Room was ready and we were able to check in when we arrived at 9 am. Pros: Early check-in. Very friendly staff. Room clean and quiet. Cons: I was traveling with 9 yr. old granddaughter - It was PERFECT. Nothing negative."
POSITIVE,"This was a terrific place to stay. The room was small, but well appointed. Wine at 5:00 - 6:00, and the staff could not have been more helpful. Definitely a great place to stay!!!! Will stay here again. And the restaurant is terrific!"
NEUTRAL,"Hotel room as nice and clean. Wood floor was a nice change, since we have 2 small service dogs we travel with. Had a coffee maker, Refrigerator, Sink, but no Microwave (strange). My complaint was the 'Hot' Breakfast in the morning. Came down at 8:30, hardly any other lodgers in the breakfast room, and hardly any food, just hard boiled eggs, some slices of bread, no coffee. In fact when we inquired about the coffee, they bought out a fresh pot, that turned out to be broken and got tired of waiting for a new pot to be brought in. Went back to our room and make coffee in the coffee servers in the room. Will think twice before using this hotel for our frequent trips to Portland. To say the least we decided to go out to breakfast."
NEGATIVE,"I rated the room comfort a 1. Not because it wasn't comfortable, it was. It was the traffic noise I couldn't deal with.Stayed three nights starting on Sunday. First night my room was right next to the 101 freeway. I kid you not, sometimes it felt like the trucks were coming right through my room. Extremely difficult time getting to sleep and staying asleep due to traffic noise.In the morning, I was awakened by someone pressure washing the outside of the building. No notice was given that this would occur. The front desk person had no idea that the washing was even going on.When leaving on Monday, asked if my room could be changed. They said they didn't have anything right then but would after 3:00. No problem for me since I wouldn't be back until after that anyway.When I returned and went to my ""new"" room, I discovered it was on the opposite end of the building from the freeway, but was right next to its on and off ramps. Not much better for noise. It was also a smaller room.This hotel has couryard rooms which must be quieter than the perimeter rooms. I would have thought that after I asked to move to a quieter room that they would have moved me to one of these. It was midweek, in a beach town, in winter. I seriously doubt if all the courtyard rooms were booked. Lack of cars in parking lot indicated that they were not full.It's a shame because the hotel itself is quite nice. It's clean and well maintained. It would be perfect if it were moved elsewhere. Pros: Courtyard looked nice Cons: Freeway noise Location: Carpinteria is a nice laid-back beach town. Short drive to Santa Barbara, Montecito and Summerland."
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed there for four nights. The king bed was extremely comfortable! My husband would like to buy one! The room was also very clean and roomy. The entire place was clean and tidy. The free breakfast was very good. Large breakfast area with lots of room. The price was very good and we would definitely stay there again. My only complaint would be that there are only two washing machines and two dryers--very limited for such a large facility. As it is close to I-5, we asked for a room facing Cedar Street. It was a very quiet stay."
POSITIVE,"All of the front desk people & other staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Located in a busy area with plenty of restaurants, etc. nearby. Hotel was clean; beds comfortable; everything worked. Pool looked fine but did not use it (wasn't warm enough)."
POSITIVE,"We were in Schererville for a wedding and needed a reasonably priced room. We were not diasppointed with this Hotel. There is no elevator, which could be a problem for some people, but it was okay for us. The room was spacious with a king sizedbed, a sofa and a flat screen tv. The bed was comfortable, my husband loved the pillows! It took a while to get the room cooled down, but it finally got there. I think if they knew they would have guests in that room they would have set the a/c on low cool. The room was quiet, we heard very little noise from other rooms or the hallway. Breakfast was very good. All in all we were pleased. There could be a larger sign to help you find this hotel, a small sign behind a Long John Silver sign was barely noticable."
POSITIVE,"The property was clean, well maintained and the staff at the front desk could not be more helpful. The breakfast room was valiantly operated by only one staff member who was constantly overwhelmed. Thus the room was frequently out of essential items, Plates, coffee, eggs, plastic utnesils etc. The waffle making area was LITTERED with used batter cups. Too messy to be appealing! Part of the blame obviously on uncaring guests but the finger must point to understaffed personnel. Room Tip: Don't get a room on the 2nd floor. A child directly above us was trying out his new logging boot..."
NEUTRAL,basic hotel stay. But I was hoping for a better breakfast and a door to separate the extra room that made it a suite.
POSITIVE,"This hotel is in the perfect location with all kinds of stores at a walking distance. You got McDonalds, Ross, PetsMart, Home Depot, Sports Cuts (hair cuting place), Payless, Pizza place, etc...to name a few ALL right across the street. Hotel is very quite with a cool workout place and excellent HOT breakfast buffet. I was surprised at what great priceÂ we paid. The rooms even have a microwave and fridge. The beds were comfy too. I guess its reasonable. Its not a five star and ofcourse, the building is a bit run down with some remodeling done over. If you are wanting to save some bucks its definitely worth your monies! Pet area is not so great though. I would stay there again. Hope that helps."
POSITIVE,"Husband and I stayed here one night to meet up with friends that live in Derby, KS which is only 10 mins aways. It was a perfect for us, we were close to downtown and there was a ton of places to eat, drink and play super close! The hotel was very clean, bed was comfortable but BRING YOUR OWN PILLOWS! that was my only complaint! bathroom was large!Â they served breakfast and parking was free! I would definitely stay here or recommend this hotel!"
NEUTRAL,the staff was very friendly and helpful. room was good could have had better pillows. we had an exit into the arburitium which was great. we were disappointed there was no fitness room and no breakfast included. we have come used to that at best westerns Room Tip: walk out into arburitium is great
POSITIVE,"We love staying at Best Westerns and this one did not disappoint. Rooms were comfy and clean, hotel staff was courteous and helpful, and the continental breakfast offered anything you could possibly want. The only complaint we had was that it is a little tricky to get to because of the one way frontage street."
NEGATIVE,We left because it was disgusting & creepy!!! Who could sleep with hair in the beds & holes in the walls at the head of the bed?!? I do not recommend it in any way to anyone!!!!
NEGATIVE,"The bed was comfortable and linens were soft. Other than that, there is lots of room for improvement. I would suggest crossing the street to the Wild Sage Cafe for amazing empanadas for $3 and great coffee rather tahn eating breakfast at the hotel! There is lots of room for improvement. For $199/night, I would expect better. The place seems run down- our carpet was stained, old school TV's, internet was shaky, and sink leaked (which we called maintenance to come fix).If you can find a price less than $100, you may feel like it's a better value. The check-in and front desk staff seemed uninterested or overwhelmed. Breakfast was generic. I would suggest crossing the street to the Wild Sage Cafe for amazing empanadas for $3 and great coffee."
NEUTRAL,"The staff were very friendly & helpful , even when the breakfast manager & reception never had the same timings for breakfast. Plenty of hot water. Breakfast was lovely , plenty of choice We booked as they had a large car park as parking in York is a problem. But they had 3 weddings on which made the car park full to overflowing. The carpets are worn & room dated (needs revamping) creaking floor boards,"
POSITIVE,"Rooms were clean, staff helpful and friendly, great location. Definitely worth it."
POSITIVE,Good hotel and easy walking distance to downtown Toronto (for those who like to walk).
POSITIVE,"This is one of two Best Westerns at Bryce Canyon City. This one appears to be newer, and quieter. We had a single King room, which was large and comfortable with all the standard amenities. The bathroom was sparkling clean. The hotel has a large public area just off the lobby, which doubles as the breakfast area. It has a large functioning fireplace. Breakfast was a cut above normal motel/hotel fare, with all food fresh and well prepared. We had one minor problem in our room, a circuit breaker had tripped, and within minutes of reporting it to staff, it was reset. Mr recommendation, if quiet lodgings are important to you, this would be the better choice."
POSITIVE,We stayed at the Carolina Bed and Breakfast during our vacation trip to Asheville and it was wonderful. Susan and James were great hosts. My wife has a special diet and Susan was very accommodating with the breakfasts as well as the evening wine and snack time. We stayed in the Hummingbird room and thoroughly enjoyed our time in the house. The front porch swing was our favorite place to relax. When we return to the Asheville area the Carolina Bed and Breakfast will be our choice location to stay.
POSITIVE,"Good value, good location. Be prepared for the shock of the small size of the room. Good to have updated equipment: ipod docking station, flat screen TV (about 1/2 the size of our double bed),free Internet use and fitness room. Creative use of the lobby and the adjoining restaurant, as it turned into a lounge in the evening, as well as a breakfast buffet in the am. Pros: Location, upscale lobby, good restaurants next door, and their attempt to update the hotel. Cons: Very musty smell emitting from A/C in the room..Doormen were a little snobby."
POSITIVE,"Didn't blow me away or anything, but a totally acceptable way to spend the night in Chico should your travels bring you there. No complaints. Pros: Close restaurants Quiet"
POSITIVE,"Very friendly service. We arrived late after a long five-hour drive, and were greeted very warmly; the front desk manager was very helpful. Check-in was quick and we were in our room within minutes. The fan in the bathroom needed to be fixed, it sounded like a helicopter taking off. The Continental breakfast had a good variety of food. Would stay again. Room Tip: Lower level rooms were quiet, although the bed was not super comfortable. Walking distance to rest..."
POSITIVE,"The staff was attentive to our needs. The location of the hotel was great! Easy to get to by car and the parking garage was a block away. The price of the garage was reasonable for New York. Pros: The location was convenient to Times Square, Broadway and bus tours. Cons: The hotel room had one bed as compared to the two beds to a room. This can be a draw back if you are traveling with a friend."
POSITIVE,This is a great place to stay. Mairim was so helpful. I hope to see you soon!
NEUTRAL,"I have stayed at different best westerns in north america that were in a ""fresher"" and more updated condition for the same price or less. I stayed at same hotel 10years ago and not much has changed maybe some paint. Overall everything just felt old and not very appealing Hope some changes can be made until then I won't return or recommend it"
POSITIVE,Pros: Had rooms available on the first floor. Cons: Need more TV channels.
POSITIVE,"Excellent and would come back again. Pros: The rooms were big, quite, clean, new and comfortable and dark for sleeping. Staff pleasant and very helpful! Cons: Could have had more items for breakfast like boiled eggs and the juices were not natural tasted manufactured."
NEGATIVE,"As with everything in California, the cost way exceeds the comforts. For the most part, nothing really worked like it should. The showers were way to hot and cold - back and forth, back and forth. Room service goofed the order regularly. Room service forgot to service our room one day and left beds unmade and wet towels on the floor. The internet went down every single day, several times a day. The TV didn't work another day. The front desk said they didn't have a treadmill or even a fitness center, but they did - go figure. They charged $14.00 per day for parking but failed to tell you that if you had anything larger than a mini cooper, good luck parking it - we stopped that and parked on the street for free! Overall, I'm pretty disappointed. The location was good for what we needed, but the quality of all services were inadequate. Just my two cents, use it as you see fit. Pros: Free Internet Cons: overall service lacking"
POSITIVE,We have stayed here many times before flying out of Seattle. There is little airport noise and it is just south of the rental return areas so dropping the car off is easy and rental car shuttles get you to the airport with ease. Staff is alwaysfriendly and helpful with directions in the area. Breakfast starts at 6 am and the paper arrives under your door for the flight home. We will be back again since we have family in the Northwest.
POSITIVE,"I stayed at this Best Western on a recent shopping trip to Denver and was very pleased with the king pet friendly room I had. The room was clean; the bedding comfortable; the mini-frig and microwave a nice touch and the jucuzzi tub much appreciately at the end of two days of power shopping. The flat screen TV is HUGE and with adequate channel choices and access to a wide variety of movies. The breakfast is very similiar to that found at most Best Westerns and is definately adequate to start the day. The only draw back was the elevator; it was very noisy and jerky (maybe it just needed a tune-up). The grounds around the hotel are very well maintained and a nice grassy area is suggested for pet walking. Although there is a per night pet fee, I found it more than reasonable compared to what other hotels have charged for much less quality. The staff appears to have a real sense of pride about the property and I would certainly recommend it to others."
POSITIVE,It was the eve of my birthday and I decided to change hotels while in Astoria and chose this hotel as it was near the Columbia River. I asked for a room with a view on a higher level floor. I received one and the desk clerk even looked up my name and noted I was already enrolled in their Rewards Program that justified an upgrade and a later check out time. I had not recalled that I had previously enrolled in this program! The staff were incredible and the room had two large windows facing the Columbia River and was beatifully upgraded. Room Tip: Rooms on the southwest side corner have the best view!
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for two nights, Newport Folk Festival Weekend, and it was a great location for our needs - easy ride to Fort Adams Park, easy access to highway to go home. Our room was pleasant and very clean. We enjoyed two hours at the pool. Had dinner both nights at the restaurant (way too busy to venture into Newport proper) - good food, reasonable, and friendly dining staff (especially Omar!) We would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"We found the room clean and spacious. The bathroom was also clean and adequate with a great shower. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
NEUTRAL,The hotel was nice the person behind the counter was very nice and help full. The room was nice could have had bigger pillows but other than that it was nice.
NEUTRAL,"Older property but well maintained okay room, older bed but all clean breakfast choices quite average Seems high for in the middle of nowhere but maybe that's why"
NEGATIVE,"Room was next to a main road and could be loud at times and the hotel could use some updating. Otherwise, Whitefish is a beautiful community."
POSITIVE,"I can't say enough nice things about our stay at this hotel. It was fantastic. The room was great and totally clean every day. The king size bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was great and without a doubt the staff were the friendliest and most helpful that you could ever hope to meet. Oh and last but not least we can't forget to mention aboutÂ the warm home baked cookies that were put out each day at the front desk.. If you are ever in Knoxville TN, do yourself a favor and stay at the Best Western Plus Cedar Bluff Inn. The price can't be beat."
POSITIVE,"The location was very convenient. We walked to stores and restaurants. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms were clean. The breakfast was nice. The hotel staff were very pleasant, courtesy, and quick to check us in. We would stay there again."
POSITIVE,"I found this location thru BW's 1-800 number. It's a little out of the way for us truck drivers, but not bad. The staff was very nice, smooth check-in, and large and comfortable rooms. I was on the second floor, (yes, I smoke). Very comfortable pillows, and great water pressure. Good breakfast. Wifi was very strong. I would stay here again. Room Tip: The room I had (216) was very quiet."
NEGATIVE,When I arrived they gave me a key to a room that was occupied. They then had rooms available on the first floor that they would not give me - I have bad knees and did not want to climb the stairs with my luggage. The handicap room they assigned was very noisy and was not comfortable. Overall bad service and no follow up by their staff.
NEGATIVE,"After traveling for over 24 hours, we were exhausted. We stopped in to get a good night sleep at the Best Western in Cloverdale, CA. Their fire alarm system failed at 3:45 AM and an ear splitting siren went off in all the rooms, sending guests outside to see what was going on. The fire department showed up and no one could figure out how to turn the loud alarms off. It took about 20 minutes for them to succeed. By that time, we were up, dressed and out the door to escape the noise. We stopped by the reception desk to ask for a refund. We were told by the attendant that she would have to talk to someone else. We called later in the day. No luck. We called again today and the manager said we should be happy that our lives could have been saved had there been a real fire. There was no fire. There was a malfunction that prevented us from getting the sleep we so badly needed. I would expect an immediate apology and refund. No such thing and I'm not only disappointed, but shocked!"
POSITIVE,The room was very nice for the price. It was very clean and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Loved the fact that it is attached to Maggie's Diner. Great place for breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.
POSITIVE,"Friendly front desk staff, nice and very clean room and bathroom, very comfortable beds and pillows, and efficient restaurant wait service. If you have a car, there is ample free parking. VÃ©ronique was wonderful to communicate with and responded in a timely manner. The hotel is directly across the Tourist Information which has a friendly staff; and, right outside you can catch the Desjardins Shuttle bus #400 (3$/adult/day; 1.50$/child 6-12 yrs. old - exact change) to and from the Terminus Beauport. This franchise deserves their great rating. Book it!"
POSITIVE,I was attending a workshop and the hotel was less than a mile away from the workshop. We were able to check in early and drop off luggage and foods in the mini-fridge. Staff was very helpful with finding grocery store and fastfood. Room wasquite comfortable!
POSITIVE,Pretty good for the price. In a low coverage zone for AT&T.; Restaurant not bad.
POSITIVE,"I stayed here on two weekend occasions because it was close to the airport and kayak.com had a good price for it. The first stay wasn't very good. I had specifically asked for non-smoking and was given a room on the 3rd floor that I was told would be quiet and away from the travelers that weekend. In fact the smell of stale cigs overwhelmed. Then they put a family with small kids and a dog in the room across from me. There was some sort of event and the shouting and loud voices kept me awake all night. I did enjoy the Yard restaurant next door though. It was convenient and the service was very good, as was the food. It wasn't until I'd checked out and left the city that I realized I'd left my new, expensive camera behind somewhere. I was determined not to stay at this hotel again but things sort of worked out such that I did stay there the following weekend. The experience was entirely different. I was given a smoke-free, quiet room on the first floor and my stay was comfortable and enjoyable; no night noises either. Then as I checked out I asked if a camera had been found in my room from the previous weekend, not expecting any luck, but to my great joy they had found it and kept it in their lost and found. It shows a wonderful integrity and I would recommend this hotel to travelers who wish to be near the airport and well cared for. Room Tip: Stay on the first floor"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was better than expected. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. The hotel room was large and clean. The amenities in the room were excellent. On the first night the room smelt of smoke. After requesting a room change the staff were very accommodating, apologising for the inconvenience and ensured the room we moved from was deodorised within minutes of leaving the room. Overall a fantastic experience and great value for money. Forgot to mention the location Is excellent. Perfectly located on the quieter Universal Boulevard so you are away from the manic International Drive, but get all the convenience of it's shops and restaurants and it's only minutes away from all of the parks!"
POSITIVE,"My stay here has been wonderful. The front desk staff have been so nice to us. The housekeeping has really done an amazing job on keeping the room clean and everything we need, supplied. The breakfast is great and we love the pool!"
POSITIVE,Really enjoyed our stay her. great staff and facilities. Massive rooms. Breakfast was great in a lovely room. Hotel feels brand new and much more high-end than you expect with a chain - especially at the price. Opposite Ruby's inn - which although fun I'd prefer to be away from. 5 mins from Bryce.
POSITIVE,"I travel allot for pleasure and business in many different countries and vary allot my travelyng style depending on my expectations and if I'm traveling with my wife and with our kids or for business. When you pay for a 3 star and get the expectedservice and amenities, the rating for the place should be great. So, this hotel delivers exactly what it should. Clean, nice and courteous service, conveniently located and a nice indoor pool, spa and sauna. It's not a 5 star and not priced that way either. I haven't read other comments but like in most cases, there most likely someone complaining about everything wanting a 5 star service for the price of 1 star and if they don't get it, they complain. I was satisfied with the BestWestern Cambridge, I have no complaint and will book again. In fact, I'm traveling in 2 weeks and will book the same place."
POSITIVE,The hotel was very helpful. They arranged our travel to the cruiseship and everything went as planned.
POSITIVE,"I experienced no problems during my stay. Location (less than a block away from the Hershey Lodge) was convenient for our conference located at the lodge. Walking distance away! Free parking all day in the Best Western lot. My room was pleasant. I was pleasantly surprised at the selection for breakfast. Hot selections as well as the cold standards, cereal, pastries, breads, but also yogurt and bananas. That really helped start my morning off well, and allowed me to focus on the rest of the day. Thanks! I disliked children noisily running in the hall around 10:00pm, but that was not the hotel's fault. I would stay here again and would recommend it to a friend or family member. The only other thing I disliked was the poor wireless internet connection in the area of my room. Signal was so low that I could not easily use the internet. Next time, I would request a room nearer to the wireless router."
POSITIVE,"satisfied with the services, clean room, good breakfast. But no service to your room. :("
NEGATIVE,"The hotel's location is great but the hotel itself is in a rather dilapated condition, with worn-out, funny-smelling hallway carpets and a bathroom with no ventilation. Also, couldn't open the window to air out the room, which was too warm even in the middle of winter, which meant we had to run the airconditioner! Staff was friendly, breakfast was basic. Size of room was good. Pros: Location Cons: Room temperature, condition of hotel Location: Right off the highway and next to a ski shop and Safeway."
NEUTRAL,The breakfast buffet was beyond our expectations. There was a good variety of food. No house keeping at night.
NEGATIVE,"The Hotel was not what we expected. We asked for an ocean view with balcony. The rooms were outdated and not at all what we asked for. Ten minutes after entering our room we were at the desk letting them know how disappointed we were. Unfortunately, there were no vacancies in the other two buildings.. we were put in the barracks and had to drag our luggage in the street to get there from the front desk lobby. We had to walk in the street every morning to go to breakfast.......there were no sidewalks !!!! The deck of the small pool was being painted while we were there. If you wanted to sit on the beach..........you had to rent a chair.....I do not consider this a resort as the name implies. This trip did not compare to any of the other trips we have taken in the past........We would not go back there if it was half price. If it weren't for the entertainment we found on our own.....the trip would have been a disaster....The air conditioner in one room was a window air conditioner and was not easy to control the temperature........the shower was very bad and the tubs looked like they needed to be refinished....I wouldn't sit it any of them. I could go on and on but I think by now you can get the picture.....we were not happy at all. If you wanted to go to a restaurant or any entertainment.......you had to have a car or take a cab ...........nothing to speak of withing walking distance......we spent a small fortune in cab fare."
NEUTRAL,"okay. Pros: Heated pool was nice. Cons: The small pillows, breakfast not as described."
POSITIVE,"Toilet in rm 103 was wobbly. It appeared to have been caulked, but with use it has loosened. Front desk said they'd look at it in the morning which was fine. Card key got stuck and I couldn't open the door without the maintenance man using his key. Standard breakfast. Large flat screen t.v. Computer desk with ports was very usable and comfortable to use.Street noise and people opening and closing doors and walking around upstairs was noisy, but by bedtime it all quieted down and I got a good night's sleep."
POSITIVE,Room was comfortable with good facilities. Location to Disneyland and Downtown Disney was great! Being Within walking distance was great.
POSITIVE,"With th its proximity to Bellis Fair Mall, yet somewhat tucked away next to a picturesque little creek this hotel is ideal for the busy traveller. We spent one night there and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's overall impression, the very friendly and courteous staff and the nicely appointed rooms. We truly loved the walk-in shower!"
POSITIVE,This Best Western is significantly better than your average Best Western for the price. Rooms are tastefully decorated with an old world charm and are in excellent repair. The staff is very pleasant and the restaurant does an excellent job.
POSITIVE,"I always stay in the same Best Western Hotel in Jacx Beach. I have NEVER gone there and was NOT very pleasantly greeted..Thanks Suzanne! I had one bad experience, but they immediately made it right and even that was not enough for me to go to another hotel.... I Love you guys ! Thanks for having such an awesome staff! see you soon ! time for another ""Calgon moment"""
POSITIVE,This is a lovely clean hotel. Breakfast is better then most. I would stay here again.
POSITIVE,Nicely updated room Had a hard time adjusting heating system
NEGATIVE,"We used the free shuttle to the zoo and there was a major mix up in our pick up. After 45 minutes of waiting, the shuttle arrives and no welcome nor was the door opened. Never an apology for the mix up. Then we get back to the room and none of our keys worked!"
POSITIVE,Really nice new hotel which is close to the airport. Gym and pool worth visiting. Free parking and breakfast are a bonus in MIA area. The breakfast was surprisingly excellent. There are a few restaurants in the area for evening dining. I'd happily stay here again.
POSITIVE,Great location. Friendly staff. Nice to have a weight room with a treadmill and bike. Lots of eats and coffee places nearby along with some nice little stores. The rooms are a little bit grubby. The comforter and carpeting both need replacing. The cleanliness was fine but not stellar. Expensive for what you get in the room itself. I would consider staying there again though mostly for location and friendliness though.
NEUTRAL,The view from our suite overlooking the mountain was very nice. The hotel was being renovated during our stay so I assume it will be nicer in the future. Our room was finished inside but the balcony extended in front of the rooms on either side of us with no divider which made us uncomfortable leaving the curtains open to the view.
NEUTRAL,"It was convenient to lax. We stayed for just one night, and after arriving from overseas at 7am, they got us into a room hours before check in. The free shuttle to the airport the next day at 5am was also great... And the driver was super friendly. It is a bit run down... Seems to be a block or two past the nicer part of the airport hotel strip."
POSITIVE,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it to others. The restaurant's menu was limited. There are many restaurants to choose from just a short distance from the hotel. The noon check-out is a bonus. Pros: We very much enjoyed the view from our room and the hotel's proximity to all that Chicago has to offer. Cons: The windows did not block out sound very well.
NEGATIVE,"Very disappointed in this hotel for some of the reasons. Staff or another guest was robbed. Safety was major concern. Pool was cold, whirlpool smelled horribly of dog(not chlorine either). Called for extra towels twice and no one would bring us towels, we called the next morning for extra towels and we were told we needed to come down and get them which is what we had to do sowe could shower. Pool area had no towels either. Unfortunately, one of the beds in our room had food in the sheets and it was obvious, the sheets on the one bed had not been changed before the bed was made, very unsanitary. ... Pros: Location. Cons: No towels in pool area, when asked staff for towels, none were sent."
POSITIVE,"Free transport to Airport, and town and good price. Clean and functional. Noisy on the street side and breakfast just adequate though included. Paper plates and plastic utensils!"
POSITIVE,"Stayed for 2 nights. This hotel is easy to find and the check-in was efficient. The complimentary breakfast was excellent (lots of selection) and they have a very nice pool. Quiet, good stay."
POSITIVE,The room size. The incompetence of the front desk personnel.
POSITIVE,I had requestee an early chek-in and waskindlyaccommodated which was ver good as I had arrived early inhe mornin from a long flight. The breakfast area is quite small and it is hard to move around when a lot of people are in the room having breakfast.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was perfectly situated on Meeting Street, midway along ""Museum Mile"". It was in easy walking distance of King Street, the city Market, the battery and some historic houses up Meeting Street. Once we parked our car in the hotel's own parking lot, we were able to just leave it there. The room was smallish, but contained everything needed. My dh was glad to see a Keurig coffeemaker in the room."
POSITIVE,Great location - right by Earl's Court tube station so easy access to Picadilly line (get to Heathrow / Leicester Sq / Covent Garden) and District line. Nice decor in the room. Breakfast had a nice variety. WiFi would only work for max 2 minutes at a time - quite stressful when trying to do flight check-in for example. Bathroom and shower quite small.
POSITIVE,"This is a nice Best Western. There is a wide range of hotel rooms within the Best Western chain and this one was one of the better ones. The location was good for us, located right on Camino Real. The room was very comfortable and clean. The bedsand linens were good. The room had a nice sized flat screen TV. Although we did a few problems with the remote. The breakfast (located in a separate dining area) that was included with the room was good but did not vary. Cereal-hot or cold, waffles, scrambled eggs and sausages, whole fruit and choice of breads. (No peanut butter available) Pool is located outside and is very small and kind of cold - we felt it and chose not to go in. The hot tub is also small but we did use it and it was perfectly acceptable."
NEGATIVE,The hotel was convenient to Disneyland as we had hoped but that is about it. They advertised queen sized beds in kids suite and we in fact got full sized beds. They also advertised two bathrooms per kids suite and we got one small bathroom. Not at all what we thought we were getting. Very close to disneyland which was a plus. Parking situation couldÂ be better at the hotel as well. Overall it's a two (2) star hotel not much more. Breakfast is a joke. Better off walking two and q half blocks to IHOP to get a quality meal. Staff was indifferent to us our whole three(3) day stay. Maybe would stay again if Portofino kids suites are sold out. Get what you pay for!
NEUTRAL,The staff was very friendly. However the rooms were a bit dirty and dingy. Pros: The staff was very friendly for the brief time we encountered. Cons: The beds were uncomfortable and the washrooms were not very clean.
POSITIVE,"We stayed in the Casa Marina building on the 2nd floor for three nights with a fantastic view of the marina, just wonderful, it has a Hawaiian feel. Pros: The room was fresh and well furnished, comfy bed and pillows, good coffee machine. Housekeeping was meticulous, reception staff were friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast with charming staff at the restaurant, good fitness centre, perfect location to go for a run in the morning. Good parking. Cons: We ended up buying earplugs because of an invasive hum all night, we did not need to use our airconditioner, the fridge had some noise, but this noise sounded like a compressor. The TV reverted to closed captioning at each start up, we had maintenance up to sort it out but it continued! It took several steps to get to get to regular TV stations, scrolling through pay movie channels etc. Bathroom seemed to lack any ventilation. Having said all of this it is a great place to stay, the pros outweigh the cons :-) Room Tip: make sure you are not near the mysterious compressor noise, ask for 2nd floor Casa Marina bldg on th..."
POSITIVE,Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean.
POSITIVE,"recently renovated, perfect for shopping getaway"
POSITIVE,"Had everything we needed...wi-fi, bed,shower, clean towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Liked the eco-conciousness of dispensers, liked shuttle service to airport, liked coffee in room, availability of coffee and snacks and fresh bananas in A.M. Remoteness from interests (restaurants, theaters, etc. since we had no rental car at point of check-in) didn't care for attached restaurant."
POSITIVE,"My wife, two children and I enjoyed the pool an the hot tub. We liked the pillows a lot. The full breakfast was very good. The only thing that was less than perfect is the thin feeling (not comfy) blankets on the beds.. None of us (except the 6 year old) got much sleep due to this. If we stay there again we will be bringing our comforters from home. Pros: Pool, Hot tub, Breakfast, pillows Cons: Thin blankets Location: Reedsport Oregon (coast)"
NEGATIVE,"Beds were awful- stupid stuff like room keys did not work properly, phone did not work properly, old TV that didn't work well. However it did serve our needs in the sense that we could park for free, could cab it into Boston easily and the price was inexpensive and we weren't there for the hotel. AC worked well and when I had a moldy shower mat they replaced it."
NEUTRAL,This hotel is an older hotel that is in good shape. The front desk staff was outstanding during my stay. This hotel offered a shuttle service to local venues that was a GREAT amenity. The only negative comment I have is the condition of the bathroom. I noticed mold on the ceiling and found a comment on the suggestion card (in the room) that identifiedÂ this same complaint from a previous guest. All in all a decent place to stay.
POSITIVE,"nicely decorated room with lots of space and all the necessities that I need in a room refrigerator, microwave and even a ceiling fan for my hot flashes in the middle of the night."
POSITIVE,This was a good choice for me since I was only there for one night and taking an early flight the next day. Free parking and shuttle were the main reasons why I picked this location. Reasonably priced and satified my needs.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was everything I wanted it to be! First thing to know is there are actually 3 different buildings with different features on this property so call ahead to get a better feel of which building would suit your preferences. We stayed in the Casa del mar which is in the middle and has views of the marina or the bay. I had coffee on my own patio each morning facing the marina. Perfect. Everything was pleasant: the spacious room, the view, the patio, the pools, the free bike rentals, the service, and the price! The ONLY thing I can think of as a drawback for this hotel is having wheels- its not far from downtown/airport but I could see not having a car as a hardship from this location. So get a rental car already and drive to this awesome hotel!"
POSITIVE,"The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I was a little earlier for check-in and still received a very nice room. The room temp was great, nice work space, great bed, close to food and shopping. Nice full hot breakfast with options.Would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,it was a really nice little room. very clean and they had a great breakfast in the morning
NEGATIVE,"We stayed for a family gathering over the first weekend in December. All went well, no major problems, alarm clock was missing and foot cover on bed was missing. The rooms could have been cleaner. Breakfast was good. We checked out and paid for our rooms...everything seemed fine. The following Thursday after we came home they charged my credit card for $100. When I called the hotel to inquire about it, they said they were charging me for a ""no show"". I said, how could it be a no show when we came and stayed and paid for our rooms? The manager, Ken, was very rude said I had one room that no one showed up for. I told him there must be some mistake and he kept rudely replying that it was a no show and we were going to be charged for it. I can't believe that they could just charge my card like that four days later after we left. I guess their customer service motto is: ""The Customer is always a liar""."
POSITIVE,"The staff was very polite and quick to respond to our questions. The suites offered a lot a space for the family to enjoy and sleep in a comfortable setting. The breakfast was very good, a nice variety was offered everyday. only negative item would be the restaurant next door. I'd go someplace else; we tried it for dinner and lunch, will not do it again. Room Tip: The bigger the better"
POSITIVE,Annual trip to Saratoga to the races. Stayed 3 nights. Rate was good and hotel was running more smoothly this year. Think this is the 5th year we have stayed here. This year was a good year. Convenient location. They are putting an outdoor swimming pool in. Hope prices do not escalate because of this.
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this Best Western on our trip between Michigan and Tennessee. This was a great half-way point for us. We arrived pretty late and everything was pretty quiet. The lady at the front desk was very friendly. The hotel room was pretty good, decent matteress, and we liked that there was a refridgerator. We had a room with a king bed. The bathroom was just o.k. Some of the grout around the outside of the tub, in the corners was a bit yuck! But I get creeped out easily by that stuff. But other then that the bathroom seemed clean. The breakfast was good, biscuits and gravey, scrambled egg patties and make your own waffles. I also used the computer in the lobby before we left to browse the internet before we left."
POSITIVE,"We took a quick trip to San Diego and stayed here for only one night. What a great hotel! We booked online and were upgraded to a room with a beautiful view (a great view of Marina!) upon arrival. The hotel room was clean and updated, bathroom had no tub, but very spacious and modern, sparkling pool and a restaurant with decent food and reasonable price. We ordered room service for breakfast and it came right on time. We're definitely going back!"
POSITIVE,"Liked: AccÃ¨s Ã  la plage trÃ¨s facile., Wifi"
NEGATIVE,"I reserved this hotel based on reviews that I read and yes, the rooms were clean, but that is about the only nice thing I can say about the place. It is in a scary run down part of town, and there is a very loud and frequent train near by. When we checked into our room, there was no luggage cart and we had to make several trips around the pool to our room with luggage, two four year olds and the dog in tow. The room was very warm and so we turned on the ac which didn't seem to be working. I went to the front desk and told her our ac wasn't working. She said there is no ac. I said that's right. She said no, there IS no ac. Apparently, all of air conditioners had been ""switched over"" to heat. I was, of course, shocked and asked her how this was possible in Tucson where the temperatures are frequently 80 degrees, even in the winter. I was answered with a blank look and a shrug. She then told me that some of their rooms have heat AND ac and I told her I would very much like to be moved to one of those rooms. She moved us to a room that she said ""according to the map"" had both ac and heat. We moved all of our stuff, again, and guess what... Still no ac. As I write this, at 9 pm, I am sitting in a sweltering hotel room with two very restless little sleepers listening to the people talking outside and the train that sounds like it is barreling towards the room. I'm not expecting to get much sleep tonight."
NEGATIVE,"never go to the best western airport inn because a motel 6 is just as good: so they suck bad. If you need some were to sleep i would try the one across from them that's were i will go next time. Liked: Location Disliked: Rooms, Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"This venue is in the middle of a ""neighborhood.+ Despite the location it is VERY clean, the staff couldn't be more helpful, check in was a breeze. Although we didn't use the amenities, the pool was clean, as was everything else. I/we would recommend this hotel to anyone; one night or a week. The bar was small, but the service was outstanding as was the cleanliness!!!!!!!!!!!!1 I'd do it again!!!!!!!!! Room Tip: Stay away from the low 100/200 rooms"
POSITIVE,"Its a great hotel if planning to stay a couple nights. Staff was friendly, room clean, near freeway and 5mins from newport beach."
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this particular hotel since 2009 for at least a 100 + days a year while working a U S Forest Service Exclusive Use Helicopter Fire Contract. (Along with my fellow 6 crew members) The reason we keep staying here is because of the helpful and friendly staff, the clean rooms, the location is awesome, and we're treated like family. Did I mention the clean rooms and being treated like family? Means a lot when your away from home for long periods of time. As for the photos, I was staying there during that time. They are the real thing!"
POSITIVE,A very nice hotel and location! We love coming to Shelter Island and walking in the park along the water's edge. When we can stay there too it's even better! Trip Advisor offered a special lower price on Memorial Day weekend here and we took it. The check in staff were friendly. The room was listed as a non view but we looked out over the parking lot to the park and water so we thought it was great! The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The maid forgot to clean out the coffee pot the first day but did it the next day. The breakfast at the restaurant was good and it has windows looking out at the marina. The hostess and wait staff were very good. It was a very enjoyable stay!
POSITIVE,"Stayed at Best Western Annapolis to be conviently located to a wedding at The Chesapeake Bay Beach Club. Location was ideal, an easy and close drive to the Bay Bridge. Liked that we were able to check in early. Staff was friendly. We enjoyed the shopping and restaurants in the complex across from the hotel. Room was clean & spacious, bed was comfortable,Â Toiletries were good. Continental breakfast was great. Loved the waffle station and biscuits w/ sausage gravy. Would definetly stay overnight again at Best Western Annapolis."
NEUTRAL,"The hotel caters for large parties and events and is set up accordingly. This means the restaurant is rather impersonal in appearance and the overall internal decor is rather dated (80s). Food is heavy on quantity and ragged in appearance, but wholesome, homely and adequate. Rooms are located at different levels due to the nature of the hotel - I recommend a sea view is essential not optional. My room was ok, but with tiny TV and pokey bathroom and dangerously hot water! However the hotel has wonderfully helpful staff, which made the stay especially pleasant."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here 2 nights. While the hotel is adequate and the room are fine, I would not consider this to be a ""resort"" as advertised. The small lobby bar was nice and very convenient, and the seating areas around the fireplace in the lobby are cozy. However, the service in the restaurant is slow, and the coffee bar that was advertised was not there. While the location right on the beach is excellent, there is nothing within walking distance as far as restaurants go. The building is a little shabby looking, and the rooms could stand an update. The grounds and all the flowers are beautiful, and extremely well-maintained. The location on the beach is wonderful, and the sound of the surf was great, even on the 4th floor. The staff was pleasant, and the service was good. I would stay here again. Room Tip: 3rd or 4th floor oceanfront rooms have great views"
POSITIVE,"Room was nice, clean, quiet, and updated with new furnishings and decorator fabrics. The style was an upgrade from many Hotels I've stayed in this past year. My bed was very comfy, I slept great. I did not get to eat breakfast, but I wish I would've had the time. I would highly recommend staying at the Saddleback Inn it was a ""Great Stay""! Room Tip: Rooms in the middle were across from the pool"
NEGATIVE,"My rating should say it all. I have stayed at this hotel mutiple times a year for the last 4 years and I have seen this place get worse over time. The rates are a joke for what you get. They say they have breakfast...........they used to have breakfast now they have some stail pastries and a pitcher of milk or Sunny Delight ( artificial OJ). The rooms are clean but keep an eye on the amenities because they dont get refilled. I have found it easier to go accross the street at he grocery store and purchase my own shampoos and soaps to make sure i have the stuff when i need it. Â I recently checked into to 2 different roms that were not cleaned from the previous guest. Â The rates are much higher than others in town that are pretty compareable now that Best Western doesnt offer anything. The only thing they have going for them is the fact that they allow Pets. I have tried to be nice and make comments to staff but they dont change anything. The other hotels I will be staying at from here on are Antlers hotel, and the Bridwell house. Good luck!"
POSITIVE,"Just returned from a 3 night stay on a business trip. All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful, especially the bar and restaurant staff. My room was plain but comfortable - everything worked and I didn't want for anything - even the kettle boiled super fast, a welcome surprise for a hotel room! Compliments must go to the chef - ate in the bar twice (both superb meals) and in the main restaurant for breakfast each morning (fresh, well cooked buffet). My reduction in stars really relates to the inadequate parking at the hotel. There are nowhere near enough parking spaces, and the space that there is is poorly shaped making for quite a headache getting in and out - they also have locals visiting the health spa which puts added strain on guest parking. All in all a nice hotel that I would return to, with just that slight reservation."
POSITIVE,"I chose this hotel because it was close to my son's apartment. We were able to walk everywhere in the neighborhood. It was a lovely hotel. The employees were very kind and helpful. The room was wonderful, beds comfy, quiet halls. I would definitely recommend it and will absolutely stay here again."
POSITIVE,I was traveling with 2 grandchildren. The stay was wonderful. They really enjoyed the pool. And the breakfast was much more than I expected. The staff was helpful and very friendly. I will definitely stay at thie hotel again.
POSITIVE,This hotel was soooo nice and beautiful location. ...We had a friend stay here and recommended and it was awesome. We had 7 of us (2 rooms) so we got the Casa Del Mar JR suite and we got the Marina bay and it was GORGEOUS !!!! The staff were super nice and the restaurant there inside the lobby was really nice and had excellent food.... the beds were really comfortable.....You will NOT be disappointed staying at this hotel :) Room Tip: I would highly recommend the 2nd floor so you don't hear them below if your on the 1st floor...
POSITIVE,"We stayed a week over the 4th and had great time. The resort is a wonderful place to stay (our 2nd time) and we have visited Ft Myers Beach yearly for 5 years. Rooms are always clean and updated. Grounds are immaculate, cleaned every day. A great plus is the shaded green space with grill, trees for shade and covered areas. After 90 plus degree days, its nice to relax in the shade. The continental breakfast is very good, really just enough to start the day off. The staff is great, they provide first class service. On one of the busiest weekends of the year, they handled several extraordinary requests in an outstanding manner. Only wish I had was that the pool was open perhaps one hour earlier and stayed open a few hours later in the evening. Room Tip: Try for rooms on upper floors on south end above the"
NEGATIVE,"Hotel is old, worn, and tired. It is a bit frightening. The staff was pleasant but the location is not good if you are planning to do anything in Richmond itself. It was not up to the standards I had experienced in the past. Things would have beena bit better if more than one elevator had been working and there had been less noise."
POSITIVE,I'm staying here off & on over the next couple of weeks & the front desk could not have been nicer ! Clean room & clean shower. Fridge & Microwave in room. Free Wi-Fi that actually works. Worth the stay.
NEGATIVE,rooms were unkempt. Dust in every corner. rude staff. ran out of juice in the morning. stale muffins. poorly lit rooms. overall poor excuse for lodging. did i mention rude staff....
POSITIVE,"This hotel worked out just great for my needs. It was close to the baseball fields where I was watching games. The room was clean and the air conditioning worked very well (which was great, given the weather while I was in Toronto). It was close enough to walk to a subway station and it was convenient for most activities that I did. Pros: It was a great deal for the price. Cons: The extra $12 per day to park."
POSITIVE,"Excellent recent stay at this property. Clean, quiet rooms. Friendly, efficient staff. Good Pool and great location. Very well-run property! They hit all the right marks, with affordable rates."
NEGATIVE,"We saw the same cigarette butt on the stairs for the 3 days we stayed. Never mind sweeping or vacuuming regularly, they don't even pick up the obvious litter. Carpeting in the room dirty. Staff could be more friendlier. Breakfast was great."
NEGATIVE,"Very disappointed in this Best Western. Overall I have had a good experience with Best Western hotels, but this one is the bottom of the barrel. We were told one thing on the checkout policy when we made the reservation and something different when we arrived. Management was non-responsive when trying to resolve the discrepancy. They simply did not care. We make an annual trip to this area for a softball tournament and I will never stay in this hotel again. Room Tip: Stay in a different hotel"
POSITIVE,"Room was large, clean, well-maintained every day by housekeeping staff. Front desk people very efficient, check-in and check-out done very quickly. Computers in a room next to the lobby very handy. Wi-fi available but not used. Complimentary breakfast room was extremely roomy, well-maintained and the breakfast food selection was excellent. Complimentary shuttle bus service to the metro was very useful every day of our stay. Room Tip: Ground-level rooms provide easiest access to free parking and for loading/unloading car, especially..."
POSITIVE,"good value, a bit worn and outdated, having a restaurant (free breakfast) and a bar was convenient and rich with stories! - good place to relax and central to sites and restaurants in Tucson."
POSITIVE,"Outstanding clean excellent staff Liked: Rooms, Service"
NEUTRAL,At around 3:45 am we wakeup to a big bang and then the loud noice of talking and screaming began. Then the sex act started and we could hear almost everything. Other than that everything was OK.
POSITIVE,"Clean rooms, comfortable beds, friendly staff. Enjoyed our weekend. We were pretty much only here to sleep. Will definately be back!"
POSITIVE,Very nice breakfast; perfect location for visiting family; comfortable room; already have recommended the facility to family
POSITIVE,we were looking at retirement homes
POSITIVE,"Bottom line - they were great - We used their shuttle twice to and from the airport, very nice and accomodating. Also, we were scheduled to arrive in Whitefish on the Empire Builder (train, unfortunately cancelled), and the motel even called this spring to inquire the exact time we were arriving so their shuttle could be there. We recommend this motel very highly for their level of service."
POSITIVE,"I had reserved and paid for a suite with whirlpool tub, but when we checked in, we were given a regular room. When I called the front desk to ask, the clerk told me, ""those rooms are extra."" I explained I understood that and had paid extra for the suite. When she doublechecked, she found I was correct, and they relocated us to the other room. ThereÂ was no apology for the confusion. The overall layout and size of the suite were great, however the carpet needed cleaning, and the walls were scuffed and had wallpaper peeling in several locations. I was disappointed in the shabbiness given the price, but I would consider staying there again if the room was updated and carpet was cleaner, or I would pay less for a regular room for a one night stay. It is very convenient to the airport and dining options."
NEGATIVE,"The Hotel its self was not the cleanest. Staff was very helpful and nice. Convenience to get to airport was very good, they made sure we had shuttle to and from."
POSITIVE,"I was very impressed with the room I booked. It was spacious and updated with a nice bath. Also had a microwave, fridge, couch and desk. Crandall Small was very helpful at the front desk. I'm glad I didn't pay more for the Sheraton up the road. This property is in a busy commercial area, so there are plenty of restaurants around. Also has easy access to I-40."
POSITIVE,"The beds were not the most comfortable, but for the price and location, it was a very good deal. We used the hotel as our home base for our skiing adventure. It is very convenient to Keystone and other area ski areas. The only problem with the hotel is the breakfast nook, as this seems to be about the size of it. It can get very crowded in a morning. The staff attempted to keep all the items stocked and did a very good job of it. My family walked away full, but as I mentioned, it can get very crowded. Pros: The view and location. It is located by a lake and the view was fantastic. Cons: The bed. Location: It is in the town center and during the winter, it has a very nice feel."
POSITIVE,"Needing a place to overnight before touring the Olympic Peninsula, we opted for the Best Western Tumwater Inn. We have quite a history of staying at Best Western's and usually are pleased with our hotels. We were not disappointed with this one. The night front desk staff the night of our stay were exceptional in their greeting when we arrived. Check in was quick and we were on our way to our second floor room. However, this property does not have an elevator. But, the clerk asked that was a problem, which it wasn't. Room was very roomy and had recently been up dated. When turning on the tv, it would not come on, a call to the front desk, and the clerk was right there to assist. The only complaint that we had was the lack of signage indicating the entrance. We could see the sign and the building, but the only sign we saw was for the Mexican restuarant nearby. We overshot the turn in and nearly had an accident trying to get back."
NEUTRAL,Great overnighter while enroute somewhere else. The location next to the beach and habour is a plus however. 10 minutes from FLL is very handy.
POSITIVE,The Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful as was the driver from and to the airport who delivered our bags and picked them up next morning. The rooms were well maintained and clean and the linen was not tired. I appreciated the convenience of free WIFI. The menu choice and dinner itself was as good as we have had in more expensive establishments and the complimentary breakfast was very welcome
POSITIVE,"I have stayed in top hotels and dives, this is neither, but the beds are comfortable, room clean, and every member of staf wonderful. I rated this hotel and my stay five out of five, because they deserve it. Great free in room wifi, a lot of posh posh hotels charge or its only in the lobby, here you can be in your room with your own laptop or if you dont have one you can go on the pc and get online in the hotels reception area and print out stuff if you need to. A great warm pool and hot spa too. No gym, but who the hell needs to pump iron before they fly bleurgghhhhh Seriously if you want to stay near airport, you want to be able to sleep well, you want a free breakfast and coffee on tap, and you want a great on the hour every hour FREE SHUTTLE service, you gotta stay here... Special thanks to DEE in reception -whos welcoming smile and sunny disposition could brighten any weary travellers day."
NEGATIVE,"I stayed here for the Death Race Weekend - the biggest annual event in the region each year. Despite having jacked up their rates, the hotel was completely focussed on having allegedly lost some towels and bedding during the previous year so were not willing to provide our family with a pillow or blanket for my four year old to sleep on the camp cot we brought for him (the hotel would only provide one rollout cot for our room ample despite space in our room, I have two small children). The staff feigned an apologetic attitude but made zero effort to accommodate any requests. The owners had clearly directed all staff to be rude and dismissive of guest issues on the weekend they make the most money in any year. Other issues were intermittent internet connection and not all TV channels were available on my TV. The Security doors on the second building were unsecured for the entire weekend we stayed with no effort to remedy the situation. While it is the newest and cleanest hotel in Grande Cache, they do not deserve any of your business unless you absolutely positively have no other choice. Good beds and a promise of free internet do not make up for such an unprofessional and discourteous attitude. TO stiff guests on basic extra amenities on the 3 days of the year they are booked full and getting to charge extra occupancy on most rooms is just plain wrong."
NEUTRAL,"Location, and it was quite clean Breakfast could improve"
POSITIVE,We were delighted with the quality and situation of this hotel. Would recommend diner at Zak's just round corner.
POSITIVE,"clean, good location, value for money. the breakfast area was toooo small/crowded."
POSITIVE,"The incredible night- time view of downtown San Diego across the sound greeted my family as we entered Shelter Island shortly after midnight on our way to The Palm Resort Best Western. The trip from the airport couldn't have been more than ten minutes, and the hotel (Motel would be the more appropriate moniker as all of the rooms I saw had exterior entrances.) proved to be in a convenient location for trips to many of the city's attractions, such as The Zoo and Balboa Park. Check-in was gratefully quick; and the room, though a little on the small side, was spotless and looked to be recently renovated as witnessed by the new carpet, large flat-screen TV, plug in internet port, and large tiled walk-in shower. The grounds, like the room, were clean and well maintained. My only complaints regard a lack of hot water on more than one occasion and a very slow drain in the shower--so slow that the water was at least an inch deep after a very short shower and.your average germaphobe would have had a heart attack. Despite the problems with the shower, the view and well-maintained room and grounds made our stay a pleasant one, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this property again or recommend the hotel to friends."
NEUTRAL,This is a fairly old hotel in the center of Moab. Room was decent and clean. Nothing spectacular. The fitness center and pool was isolated across the parking lot...Didn't seem to safe to go to in the night and it was just too cold to walk to.
NEUTRAL,"Room was of 4-star comfort and definitely above the usual BW standards. However the breakfast arrangement was awful. The breakfast area resembled a works canteen and was overcrowded with guests jostling for space and grabbing what they could find from a choice of very mediocre dishes/food. In all my global travels I have never experienced such a shoddy breakfast service. On two occasions I couldn't find anywhere to sit and when tables did become free, the few catering staff that made an appearance had insufficient time to clear the mess away. A total disgrace. The breakfast arrangement needs serious re-management. It spoilt totally the ambience of this hotel and was not inkeeping with the standards of the rooms. Front desk staff were unwelcoming and inconsiderate to the point of rudeness. The person who attended to me had no inkling of customer service or interraction. My requests were rudely dismissed and I was left with the impression that these staff had absolutely no interest in my welfare. Best Western organisation/Management needs to urgently address these issues and train their reception staff on basic courtesy when dealing with customers. Had it not been for the attitude of the front office staff and the dreadful breakfast, I would have considered awarding a higher grade. At the excessive rate I paid, I think more should have been done to provide an attractive atmosphere for breakfast (no other meals provided here). The hotel would improve if they reconfigured the breakfast room and raised the quality of the food."
POSITIVE,It was local to the event we attended and was a reasonable rate. The hotel has no on site restaurants or bars.
POSITIVE,"Conveniently close to everything. Beach, shopping and restaurants."
NEUTRAL,"Shower was hot ,cold ,hot , cold, hot, cold, hot, cold worst I have ever been in!!! Shower users beware! No temperature control. Last time ever I will ever stay in a Best Western. Room Tip: Very poor climate control. Hotel is right on Freeway. Beware of road niose on that side."
NEGATIVE,"The area the Hotel was in seemed sketchy. I was scared to let my niece who is 16 years old, walk around with out me or my husband"
NEGATIVE,Where to begin...over $300 a night and does not even have air conditioning? This place is the most over priced hotel I have ever stayed at. This hotel needs to either lower its rates or invest some capital into the property.
POSITIVE,This is a comfortable stay for the money. We used the pool even though it was cool water. We had absolutely no noise to disturb us and we would definitely stay again!
POSITIVE,"Stay here! A good choice if you are in Pendleton. Liked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,"I stay at this hotel (sometimes weeks at a time) when I am in town for work and it is a great place to stay. At first I was a little hesitant because I had never stayed at a Best Western, but since it was close to the office I thought I would try it and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED! The staff is friendly, the rooms are very nice (with a refridgerator in eachÂ room), it has a hot tub, a sauna and small fitness center. This is the place to stay if you want something affordable, but clean and comfortable!"
POSITIVE,"Location was great to visit Peach Drop, and surprisingly quiet. I had forgot my IPod charger, and it was a pleasant surprise to find a docking station in the room, bath and body lotion, and loved the shower head! Would like biscuits n gravy for breakfast."
POSITIVE,"Spend three nights for a training class near by, the Hotel is a family run bussines - Was one on the cleanest out side entry hotels I have ever stayed at - Not all will have the same experience as I did. My room (303) was at the front of hotel and appeared to have been remodeled and the carpet was just cleaned. James at the front desk is everything you read in the comments. The day clerk (I think one of the owners) was very nice and helpful, he let us use the fax and scanner for some documents we forgot. The free breakfast is the standard Best Western deal and was excellent - The whole property is well kept and within walking to places to eat. - You got to go to the Jelly Jar for their Bean Buffet....Will stay again when in area"
POSITIVE,"Room was very clean and well maintained. Rug was even clean. Great place, I'll stay there again."
POSITIVE,Good clean hotel for a very affordable price that is one exit away from Sea World.
POSITIVE,"Excellent staff-very attentive and kind! Cean, nice size room. Very nice having the shuttle service. Appreciated that the breakfast had something besides the usual unhealthy heavy carb junk, for instance omelet and sausage, apples, boiled eggs.Really hated the hours of the workout room-doesn't open till 10AM and closed at 10PM! i didn't end up getting to use it because of that. Microwave might have been nice, but appreciated the refrigerator. All in all, seems to be well run."
POSITIVE,The room was nice and spacious. We had a little terrace that opens onto the pool. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast was good but basic. The location was perfect. Not far from Hwy 101 and close to everything. The ocean view was outstanding !
POSITIVE,"Location and price. Description of how to use the TV remote, the key for the elevator, and how to use the phone when it is not operating need to be clear and written in the handbook/guide."
NEUTRAL,good value clean room easy access
NEUTRAL,It was a great room and clean It was hard to find and not very good english was spoken by staff
POSITIVE,This motel has beautiful landscaping and an excellent restaurant next door. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet
POSITIVE,Good location. Can walk to hot springs. Pool open later for adults only. Nice restaurant across the street. Big deer come to feeder to watch
POSITIVE,"I decided to stop here at the Pecos Inn on my way during a long road trip with 2 young kids (5 and 9). Location was good and was easy to find (my cell phone, with navigation, died before I got into town-- I appreciated the billboard advertising that gave directions!) Rooms were larger than I expected-- I had two queen beds and there was still plenty of room for the recliner, small table with two chairs, a desk and chair, the two dressers. Nice touch having the sink, microwave and mini fridge in a separate area outside of the bathroom. The room was quite-- didn't hear neighbors in either room to the side, from upstairs (we were on 1st floor), from the halls or the parking lot.) Beds were comfortable-- sheets were ok-- not the softest, but clean at at least as good as one would expect from a hotel in this class. I liked the 4 pillows per bed. No need to fight over the pillows. Rooms were clean and I didn't notice any lingering stench from smoke (I am quite sensitive). The breakfast, which was free, was a nice change from the buffets that other hotels offer. It was enjoyable. My kids and I enjoyed the indoor pool. It was a nice way to unwind (and spend energy) after driving all day in a bumpy and loud jeep. Hot tub was hot-- not lukewarm like other hotels. Staff was nice. Other guest were respectful and friendly. Didn't hear (or see) kids running in the halls or any parties (it was a Saturday night stay). Perhaps having the indoor pool let the kids burn energy. Overall-- nice place to stop. We rested nicely. Isn't this what you are looking for??"
POSITIVE,"I made a request for microwave and refrigerator, and they were not in the room nor could the be provided. The door to the room did not work well, looked like it had been broken into before. One of the bed lamps did not work. The hotel was not as close to downtown Chicago as I would have liked to have been. Other than that, the staff was great and itÂ was a nice area to stay in. If the train ran later going back to the hotel it would have been better for going to downtown and having fun."
POSITIVE,"Cherae and Cynthia at the front desk were so helpful during our 1 week stay. They should be commended for a courteous, friendly and job well done. They showed true compassion while we were there attending a family funeral. Angel in the resturant is awsome also!! Can't wait till the next stay. Herb Wayne Weatherington"
NEUTRAL,"The room was great. The staff were all friendly. The wi-fi could not be used. The Business computer was out of order. And, all three cardiovascular machines were out of order."
POSITIVE,"The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was large, well maintained, and clean. The free breakfast was great. And the neighborhood is perfect for exploring on foot. Also, much less car traffic than in midtown."
POSITIVE,"The hotel has a great staff and the room was better than we had expected. We will return and recommend to other's,"
POSITIVE,"I only stayed one night but my room was very comfortable, clean and quiet and some good choices for breakfast. I will definitely stay again if I need to stay in Madison again."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here again for 2 days with some friends. We got adjoining poolside rooms and kids were more than satisfied. The entire hotel is very clean! I love that! Love that the rooms are well looked after and always being tended to. Beds are comfortable and rooms are well appointed. We didn't notice it being loud between rooms either. And we left our doors open slightly at night. Our friends didn't even know that I had got up and showered in the morning. We were a little disappointed in the breakfast this time though. Maybe it was because we got there later than normal and they were wrapping up the breakfast, but it wasn't what we have had before! We only ate there the first morning and found somewhere else to eat the second. All in all though, it didn't turn me off of the hotel. I will definitely return to this hotel! And recommend it to anyone! Room Tip: Pool side is awesome!!"
POSITIVE,Great value and convenient to our travel destination Noisy kids in room next door past midnight. Beer bottles and a couple kissing on the ground in parking lot upon our departure.
POSITIVE,"It seems there was a flood on the ground floor so the corridor smelled a bit musty, other than that a good experience. Pros: Convenient, friendly staff and very accommodating."
POSITIVE,"We stopped here, driving from the coast toward the Sierra's. We basically picked it out of our AAA travel guide, put it in the GPS and arrived on their doorstep, tired and ready to rest. The desk clerk was friendly and offered us a nice room upstairs, away from the road. It was a lovely room, quite large for a BW in the middle of town. Freshly decorated, the king bed was very comfortable, we had granite countertops in the sink area, which is in a separate dressing area. Nice to have a place to spread out the suitcases and hang up clothes. The bathroom was rather stark, but spacious. It was surprisingly quiet here and we slept well. We had breakfast in the Garden Cafe, located in the center of their parking lot. Breakfast is not included in the room fee, but the prices there are reasonable. Limited choices, but cooked to order and good. Room Tip: No elevators to the second floor rooms"
NEUTRAL,"Our room was nice and appeared newly upgraded. The service was great. Make sure you stay away from the street as it gets noisy. The only complaint was that there was occasional noise from guests walking to their rooms. There was free parking eventhough it was a busy weekend. There are great restaurants nearby and the hotel is close to Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney and Marina Del Rey. It is a good value for the price. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from the streets and the pool."
POSITIVE,"It was a beautiful hotel with exceptional service. Room was always cleaned perfectly. Great location to restaurants, downtown, and the spectacular Grand Tetons! Would recommend this to anyone."
POSITIVE,"Booked this hotel for two nights as a stop off between Houston and New Orleans, thought we would have a look at the surrounding area including Lake Charles and a couple of Casinos. It was well situated and easy to find, with Lake Charles and casinos about 10-15 minutes away. The hotel was nice and clean, our room was also clean, large, quiet and comfortable, the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was fine. We only have one minus which was when we came to checkout they couldn't get the safety deposit box open, they tried to get a locksmith to come as quick as possible without success, but in the end it was found that our valuables were in a different numbered box that was in the log and on the key which wasted over an hour of our time, the staff were very apologetic and I would still go back to this hotel at any time."
POSITIVE,"I loved the suite we were in. One room contained 2 queen beds and a t.v.and the other roome had the hide-a-bed couch, sink, chair, coffee table and fridge and t.v. The kids took over the hide-a- bed and my husband and I got to sleep in our own beds. I loved the pillows! So comfy. Also the room was a the end of the hall so less distraction from the kids for others visitors. Breakfast was awesome. They had a lot to choose from. Pros: pool, breakfast, exercise room Location: It was right off the interstate and easy to find."
POSITIVE,"close to everything ,nice people ,clean room."
NEUTRAL,"It was OK, it's on the Beach... Liked: Service, Location Disliked: Rooms, Value"
NEGATIVE,"I suppose this hotel gets lots of guests who are in Madison for UW hospital or for a convention or football game. I am from Madison and my husband and I have stayed at many hotels as we return almost every year for our anniversary. This hotel by far the worst we have stayed at. The only reason it is a 3 star hotel in my opinion is that they have a restaurant. We didn't eat anything at the hotel so I can't comment on that. Service was rude...we waited nearly 15 minutes to check in. Mind you, there were THREE people at the front desk and only one party ahead of us. Our room was mediocre at best. The beds are flimsy, the tub drain was clogged. It also smelled like an ashtray. Apparently they keep the nicer rooms for the Highland club...if you buy a standard room, it will NOT be one of those. Those are the rooms with pillowtop matresses and updated bathrooms. Interesting as those are standard in all rooms in the other 3 and 3.5 star hotels we have stayed at! This is one of the oldest and most poorly maintained 3 star properties I have stayed at in the area and I have no idea why the rates are so high and why it has gotten such good reviews."
POSITIVE,"In my party of 7 people, we stayed 1 night for our 7 night cruise in Hawaii to other Islands. The staff were very friendly. A special thanks to Crystal, James, Rickey and Robert. As a student, I was able to use the computer in the dining area and complete my studies, very early in the morning. The staff was very accomodating with coffee to assist me in waking up. They went out their way to assist us in the location of shops, mapping the route to tourist events and restaurants. All my group slept very well, rooms were very clean and we all enjoyed the continental breakfast before we left to go on our cruise. Everyone thank me for the selection of this hotel. When I go back, I will stay there again. TLT"
POSITIVE,"It was a pleasant stay, the accommodations were pleasant enough, and the staff, especially the concierge, was very friendly. Downtown and within easy walking distance of many places. I had no trouble sleeping, although we were on the ground floor. We had a refrigerator and microwave in the room."
POSITIVE,"I travel a great deal for work and was incredibly pleased when I checked in and learned the prices (affordable). I was even more pleased when I opened the door to the room and saw what I was getting for the money I spent. Exceptional. I have paid a great deal more at other places and would have preferred staying in my car (dirty and nasty). This hotel was modern, clean and that view! Wow. Too bad I was there for work and not pleasure. I will stay there everytime I am in Grand Marais and suggest you give it a try too."
POSITIVE,This is a great hotel and right on the highway. Great for overnight stay while traveling. First hotel I have seen having biscuits and gravy in their breakfast. Very friendly and helpful. Beds were great for a good night's sleep.
POSITIVE,"Everything with the stay was fine with the exception of the breakfast. The area was way to small, the selection of food was disapointing, the area was very unkept and at 10:05 ( the breakfast ended at 10:00) I had to battle with the attendant to get a cup of hot tea. She insisted on putting the tea bags away as well as the cups. I had to get anotherÂ employee to allow me the cup of tea."
POSITIVE,"We have never be in New Orleans before and booked this online. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms were very clean, nice, and well decorated. We requested a room overlooking the courtyard and it was peaceful and had a beautiful view. The hot continental breakfast was one of the best we've ever had at a hotel.Â The desk staff was very helpful and told us what streets to stay on after dark and arranged a bus tour for us on our 2nd day. The hotel is about 6 blocks from the French Market and 3 blocks from Bourbon Street, well within walking distance. We will definitely stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"This is a rather new hotel and and still has that new smell of new carpet and if that bothers you, be advised. The rooms are large and the interior design, although not may taste, is in good taste. There is a nice ref and microwave. The TV is excellent, however, more HDTV channels would be nice. The beds are just okay, maybe a bit on low price quality; however, that being said the sheets are the roughest I have ever encounted in a US hotel. I do not know what fabric they are but they were covered with little hard fuzz balls, not like sleeping on sandpaper, but getting there. We ended up sleeping on top fo the duvet cover as it was smoother. Frankly my partner and i both had a bad night's sleep and we both had a sore back all the next day. No matter how nice the rest of hotel or room is without a good nights sleep I cannot give hotel a higher rating. Free breakfast was just fair; however lady tending the buffet was very nice and helpful. The Holiday Inn Express next door (same price range) is a better bet. Room Tip: Ground floor rooms have high ceilings."
POSITIVE,"My wife and I took a weekend break in the Cumberland Valley and found this hotel to be a good location for exploring Hagerstown and the surrounding area. The room was clean and comfortable. The free WiFi was fast. Every item was in good order. It would have been nice to have an LCD TV rather than the old style CRT set but it was serviceable. The hotel foyer is large and attractive. The breakfast room is clean and well stocked with the usual simple breakfast items: cereals, pastries, and do it yourself waffle maker."
NEUTRAL,"The room was clean, the free breakfast was good, fast access on and off the highway was a plus. Just not much around the hotel and not in a great area. The building was older although they have tried to update the lobby and rooms."
POSITIVE,"this has to be the best most comfortable, and incredible deal in the portland vancouver area. extremely comfortable bed, close to everything, the staff is just wonderful. I can't believe it took me so long to find this place. so much better than any of the over priced hotels in the area."
POSITIVE,"I loved the view from my room and the convenience of a microwave & fridge. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Special thanks to Alanna and Mike, at the front desk, who exemplify great customer service! It would be great if there was an on-site restaurant or cafeteria style kitchen."
POSITIVE,great breakfast
POSITIVE,Comfortable and clean. Staff was helpful and quickly responded to my needs. Conveniently located near highway and restaurants. Great continental breakfast!
NEUTRAL,"The environment was extremely friendly, staff was great. My problem was restaurants were not in walking distance from the hotel. The store inside the hotel lack sufficient items (razor soap tooth paste in a tube. Pros: The staff was very friendly. Cons: The only food that was available was breakfast and vending machines."
POSITIVE,"We had to book last minute, and decided on the Best Western. Room was clean, good air system ( quiet) Balcony , nice to open the door in the morning for fresh air. Well stocked breakfast goodies. Just wish we had more time to enjoy the pool."
POSITIVE,Excellent location and priced more reasonable than neighboring hotels. Very clean but a little noise from traffic in room on union street side.
POSITIVE,"For the price, it was a great value. Clean and near everything, I'd stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"Pros: It was very clean, and had beautiful artwork. Cons: They did not have our reservations."
POSITIVE,"Pros: Convenient, spacious. Cons: Could use modernized TV with additional inputs."
POSITIVE,"Hotel was clean, breakfast buffet was good, staff were helpful, friendly and attentive, close to all attractions. Lift very slow, they must replace it. Breakfast room a little small so got overfull on weekend. Noise from horns sounded from trains passing."
NEGATIVE,"Pros: The wings were OK in restaurant, shuttle service was great, bartender very nice. Cons: Hallways dingy carpet worn, place had bad odor bed terrible and toilet paper was bad."
POSITIVE,"I had a really nice experience with this hotel. However, it was under constructions that's why I could not enjoy my stay as much as I'd love to. The construction work was not noticeable when you were in your room, but we couldn't use the pool/spa area at all, that's why I would wait until construction is done. Apart from that, I would recommend the hotel. Nice and friendly staff, good room conditions."
NEUTRAL,"My wife and I drove down from Central PA just to eat a t Volt and we needed a place to stay that wasn't going to break the bank. This place was it! Friendly staff, accessible, good (FREE) breakfast and nice location to downtown area. The rooms could be looked after better, dusty, poor vacuuming, small things. Overall it was a great experience and weÂ would come back. Thanks!"
POSITIVE,Pros: Best french toast I ever had and I had them all! A+. Cons: No elevator.
POSITIVE,right in the airport and convenient. back not a particularly nice or upscale hotel. very basic. small rooms. But when you wake up in the morning you can just go downstairs and check your bags without even going outside.
NEUTRAL,"We had ridden several hours on motorcycles for a bike rally in Prineville. When we walked in to register we must have looked a bit windswept because the lady at the front desk took 2 steps back like we frightened her, she quickly gave us our room key and never mentioned they served breakfast each morning. The breakfast has muffins, fruit, cereal, eggs and bisquits w/gravy. There was no bacon, sausage available. We found out about breakfast when we went downstairs later and we asked the gentleman behind the desk for the evening shift about it. The man who works the desk on the evening shift wasn't properly dressed all 3 days we were there, wore the same shirt and it was not ironed, very wrinkled so I'm surprised he wasn't sent home and asked to change into proper attire. As the evening progressed I came downstairs several times to find him smoking cigarettes out in the front of the hotel, not real professional for a Best Western in my opinion. We stayed for 3 nights, hotel was full but very quiet. The room is a bit dated, decor doesn't match well but is comfortable. Another thing that stood out regarding this hotel not being up to BW standards is the front of the hotel hasn't been maintained well. There are 2 bowed benches in front for customers to sit on and they are about to fall apart, the trash can wasn't emptied the whole time we stayed there and it was filled to the top, garbage overflowing and was attracting bees and flies. The hotel keeps the front door wide open and I noticed a bee flying around the lobby. There were some flowers in several pots but they hadn't been manicured or watered for a very long time, the dirt was cracked it was so dry. When we returned to the hotel each day I noticed the bath tub had not been washed out nor had an empty bottle of shampoo been removed from the tub caddy. We also found a empty tampon wrapper in the bathroom trash can on the day we checked in. I think they can do much better than this, we stay at BW a lot and this one is below standard. Room Tip: We stayed in the King Executive Suite, has a room divider between bed and living area. Stay on top..."
NEGATIVE,Pros: Good free breakfast. Nice staff. Comfy beds. Cons: Hallways were dirty and smelled like a dorm room.
POSITIVE,My 2 small children and I were in town visiting family. The Best western had a nice continental breakfast that included a do it yourself waffle bar. The beds were very comfortable and the room was clean. The hotel did have a nice pool and spa but we didn't use it due to the weather. our room was located on the first floor we had a glass sliding door that lead out into the courtyard. I would stay at this hotel again.
POSITIVE,"The staff at the Best Western Blue Ridge Plaza are super friendly and very sweet. Rooms are clean and spacious, ours came with a microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. The continental breakfast is wonderful, serving waffles, cereal, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, and many more side items. Their coffee was excellent also. You will not be disappointed with this hotel. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!! Room Tip: If you only need 1 bed and they have you booked for 2, tell them you only need 1 bed and they may up..."
POSITIVE,This hotel was located in the historic district of St. George. It was within walking distance to shopping and restaurants. It had a small but pretty pool with a fountain and hot tub. We visited nearby Zion and Bryce National Parks from this location.
NEGATIVE,"Where do I begin, the parking is ridiculous. The parking lot does not have enough spaces for all the guests to park. The heater was incredibly noisy. The front desk called our room at midnight, while we were sleeping to inform us that there had been complaints that we were being too loud, when in fact it was the apartments across the way that were causing all the noise. When I brought it to the attention of the staff the next morning how unacceptable it was to call us with out checking it out themselves first, they insisted that they did check it out and "" oh we must gave made a mistake"" After the phone call it took my mom ad I at least an hour to fall back asleep after being startled out of a sound sleep. Absolutely ridiculous , I would never say there again,"
POSITIVE,"We stayed one night at the Best Western, on the way back up North from Florida. The staff were friendly, the room was immaculate and well equipped, and they greet you with warm chocolate cookies! We were dead tired from the road, but it seemed quiet, and no one bothered us. There's free parking, high speed wireless Internet, and we had a microwave and refrigerator in our room. Breakfast was good, if a bit crowded with all the NYers who wanted to hit the road early on Easter Sunday. For $75 plus tax, this was a better experience than most $200 hotels. I'll be back, I hope!"
POSITIVE,"In room 120 and 121 the phone has alarm that goes off at 0300. When we spoke to the hotel receptionist about the alarm going off she said, ""Oh there is a problem with the phone system. We can't fix it but I can give you a discounted rate.""Something doesn't sound right."
NEGATIVE,"The location I was familiar with, the hotel foyer and room was clean and as expected. The beds were the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on. One would squeak every time you moved and the second was so hard it felt like I was sleeping on the floor, kept waking up every hour. A couple of guests were a bit noisy at 3:30am as they came from the casino... Won't be staying there again."
POSITIVE,"We got detoured to this town and found this place by accident. I was unsure about staying at any Best Westerns since my last experience wasn't so pleasant. This place was a little gem and partially restored my faith in BW. The only thing I would add was you may prefer to stay on the top floor if the choice is there. We could hear the people in the suite above us making every move (thankfully they weren't an amourous young couple!! LOL!!), since the floors are wood. Right down to the restaurant they recommended, we ended up bring back most of it since the portions were soo big!! Thanks for the pleasant stay!!"
POSITIVE,"BW Chocoalte lake works well for us, as it's close to Halifax shopping, access to highway to get to Hammonds Plains, and easy to get into downtown/Spring Garden. Price is a bit high for overall condition, but Halifax hotels are expensive in general."
POSITIVE,The Staff was wonderful and made my visit and stay relaxing. I felt at home and could have stayed longer if time permitted!! Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet
NEUTRAL,In a pinch when visiting Coronado Island I will stay here but it is far from my favorite place to stay. Perhaps a business traveler with no vacation plans in mind would be better suited for this property as it is on the main street that comes off the bridge and not convenient for walking to the beach or shopping. They keep the property clean and have donuts and coffee in the morning. If the bay end of the island is what attracts you this hotel would be of closer proximity. Room Tip: Ask for a room away from 3rd Street so you don't hear the noise of the traffic coming off the br...
POSITIVE,The rooms were quite OK for the price of an oceanfront hotel. Pros: Oceanfront Cons: A bit smaller room than expected. Location: Great location to everything.
POSITIVE,"My client insisted I stay at this hotel when I usually stay at the Holiday Inn Express or the Hampton Inn in Woodland. I was reluctant, but I tried it for one night. I was delighted with how clean and sparkling my room was! The room looked freshly remodeled, the bathroom was really, really clean, and the carpet was nice. I liked having a microwave and refrigerator in the room. I did miss the fluffy towels I was used to, and I missed having a real desk to work at, but other than that, this room was ok. I will even stay here again on my next visit to Woodland. The location can be a bit noisy early in the morning as the trucks rev up to get back on the interstate nearby, but I was on a business trip, so I had to rise early anyway. And for those who care, there are TWO hot tubs by the pool."
POSITIVE,We were well pleased with this property. The staff was helpful and friendly. Our room was very nice and clean. It took us at the most 5 mintues to get to the RiverWalk and it was a pleasant walk. We we stay here again. Pros: Location; free parking is a BIG deal! Cons: Nothing Location: Five minutes from Riverwalk
NEUTRAL,"My one night stay was pleasant at this Best Western Plus Hotel. The beddings and pillows were clean and comfortable. It was convenient with the microwave and refrigerator in the room. The buffet breakfast was okay. Overall, we'd recommend this Best Western Plus Hotel to any finicky travelers who would be pleased about it."
POSITIVE,Located at the intersection of 20 and 520. Fairly easy to find. Easy access to different HWY. Front desk is friendly. The room condition is good. The breakfast is very simple.
POSITIVE,"The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, jacuzzi, and pool. It was a great deal!"
POSITIVE,"Clean, convenient, and my room was quiet. Room was stuffy and smelled like animals had been there, but it wasn't terrible. Pipes were not insulated so the shower noise from other rooms was horrendous for short bursts of time. Generally very good experience. Rates were commensurate with quality relative to other area properties."
POSITIVE,"I've stayed at this hotel before and it is an excellent value. Beautiful location, friendly & accomidating staff and clean, nice rooms. But at this last stay we received a poor room location and it made a big difference in our ability to relax, enjoy and . . . sleep! We were located next to the delivery ramp! Starting at 6:00 a.m. every morning we were awakened to the sound of large truck engines, beeping, unpacking and conversation. I would stay here again, but I would have a say in my location upon check in."
POSITIVE,"We are a family of 4 adults and we stayed here from the 11th-16th Jan. We booked a 2 bedroom apartment and when we walked in we were delighted at how spacious it was. Our king bedroom was large and the living area also provided plenty of space. The apartment was clean and nthe furnishings looked new and were so very comfortable. The location was great...only a 10 minute walk to Times Square and 5 to the Rockefeller Centre and around the corner from a subway. All the staff were very friendly, helpful and fantastic! They made you feel so welcome. The breakfast was very good and even thought he breakfast room is small, we always got a table without any trouble. It was an excellent rate for the location and I would highly recommend it to you! Would definately stay here again...it is EXCELLENT! It really is a home away from home!"
NEUTRAL,It was a bit noisy and the carpet was old. Hotel needs updating but was comfortable and in a nice location.
POSITIVE,"The hotel is in a decent position, close to Fallowfield town centre which has quite a few bars and restaurants. The staff here were absolutely top class. The rooms however were a little tired, as is the back of house, corridoors, etc. Front of house, reception, bar areas, etc. are all of a good standard. The room was large and comfortable enough. Bathroom was small and a little awkward due to the cramped layout. TV reception seemed poor, even though it was digital, perhaps it just need tuning properly. By and large, fine for the price. We stayed for their New Years Eve event, which by the way was excellent. Access to reception is awkward as it's on the first floor and I didn't see a lift anywhere. Walking from reception to rooms, bar and restaurant areas also involved lots of stairs. Free WiFi throughout. The hotel has a limited number of free parking spaces(about 20), the rest, in a secure area, are Â£5 a night."
POSITIVE,"Great location, great service, easy check -in, easy check-out, took care of our needs, Crabby Bills next door was fun, on the ocean was nice, close to all our attractions and airport"
POSITIVE,"The airport shuttle ran regularly--you didn't have to call or sign up for it. The room was extremely comfortable and well appointed (mini frig, microwave; adequate drawer and closet space). Delaine's Restaurant, in front of the hotel, was reasonably priced and the food was excellent. The hotel is located in an industrial area. There is little within walking distance."
NEUTRAL,"We stayed in this hotel the night before a cruise. The price was decent and the room was clean. No serious complaints. The check-in process was a bit chaotic, and the hotel could not let us have our room even though we arrived only 45 minutes before their (late) check in time of 3pm. Front desk staff were quite rude. Did not take advantage of the free breakfast because it ends too early in the morning to be really useful to anyone that likes to sleep in just a bit. Breakfast ends at 9am. Very close (walking distance) to good pre-cruise shopping at Oakwood Plaza (this is not a great plaza, but it has a decent selection if you forgot to pack anything). Stores include BJs (liquor store), an Old Navy and a K Mart. Again, not stellar shopping, but okay if you need a couple of T-Shirts, some sun block, and a couple bottles of booze to smuggle onto your cruise. :)"
POSITIVE,"Overall: Excellent value, nice hotel. Nice pool and area. Great location."
POSITIVE,"This review is long coming as we spent spring break in NYC. We chose the Hospitality House based on having 5 members in our family and needing a bigger room. Because we have school aged children (3) we did not feel comfortable in an adjoining room. The hospitatity House of Best Western offered a 2 bedroom unit with a full kitchen and dining room. When we arrived the room (more like apartment) was clean and spacious. The kitchen had a full size fridge, coffee maker, pizza wheel, etc. The bathroom was big and clean as well as were the bedrooms. Also, having the dining room/living room with a big screen TV made spreading out easy. Downstairs, we asked the front desk manager-Sam for some info and he was extremely helpful and gave us some great tips. The breakfast was cereals,yogurt, waffles, coffee and juice that was refreshed all the time. We were pleasantly surprised that we ended up with a great hotel in a great location--just around the corner from the InterContinental. I would highly recommend this hotel for families with kids or it would be great for a girls weekend. I dont think you would be disappointed! Very impressed with this Best Western."
POSITIVE,THE HOTEL ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN THE BED AND LINES WERE ALSOME AND DONT FORGET THE PILLOWS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THE PILLOWS CAM FROM THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST WAS GREAT THE STAFF WERE FRIENDLY THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE YOU A SCORE OF 4 ON TWO WAS BECAUSE OF CONSTRUCTION OTHER THAN THAT OUR STAY WAS ALSOME
POSITIVE,"We traveled to the area for a graduation party. The rooms were large and spacious! The breakfast was great, staff was friendly, and the kids had fun at the indoor pool while I worked out in the fitness room. The location was perfect, and I would definitely stay again! Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants"
NEGATIVE,"I've stayed at quite a few BW hotels and have been very satisfied.This one was somewhat disappointing. The hotel staff was great and very accomadating,which made a big impact on our stay. We had to switch rooms the second night because the first room was loud because of the trucks that were pulling into the cafe outside of our room.Alot of noise inÂ general.The toliet kept running and the bathroom and sheets smelled exceptionally strong of bleach!! The heater also smelled when we turned it on. The second room was much better and a better stay! Overall,i would not stay there again."
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, right on an Executive type golf course! Clean, modern, terrific firm bed; room appointments very nice (including an in-room refrigerator), clean, modern. No pool, but sauna and jacuzzi were nice. A bit off the beaten path, but if you have wheels anyway a very nice place off the beaten track!"
POSITIVE,"The inn was nice well appointed, kinda close to where we were going, it was clean the rooms were updated besides the hard wire wifi. No hot tub but there was a semi heated pool a work out room spa and sauna. The t.v was super large so it was great to catch the 49er game on sunday. There is a resturant on site although we only ate the breakfast wich was great for a Best Western! i should know I am a employee thrugh the chain. Alfie was at the front desk and answered all of my tons of questions, he was super friendly and helpful. The only downside was there was no towels in our room and when we checked in the door was propped open as if it was not yet finished. However that would not effect my descion to stay again."
NEUTRAL,One elevator that was slow made the stairs a preferred option. No balcony was a disappointment leaving little space to dry beach towels or relax away from the kids. The location was close to all necessary amenities which was a plus. Parking was covered but the lot was tight. A decent experience but I would try another hotel next time we are in theÂ area.
POSITIVE,"Stayed for biketoberfest. They provided security for the few hundred bikes on the property which was greatly appreciated. Pool was clean, room pleasant. bed comfortable. Staff pleasant. convenient IHOP and 7 eleven across the street with grocery and liquor store also nearby. Appeared very quiet in the rooms even with that many bikers staying. We would definitely return."
POSITIVE,We had a great stay. The staff was incredible. The only thing I would change is the breakfast area which does not have enough seats and the pool was at a different hotel. Other than those two miner things the hotel was great. I would stay again.
POSITIVE,"We have stayed here numerous times. The location, condition of the rooms, friendly staff breakfast keep us coming back."
POSITIVE,I was very pleased with the quality for the price. The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean and the continental breakfast was much better than most other places I have stayed. I would definitely stay there again if I were in the area.
NEGATIVE,"I saw the same stuff on the floor for my entire stay, which tells me the carpet was not vaccumed even once during our stay of 6 days in September, 2011. Room was overpriced and breakfast was a joke that we went to a restaurant every morning. Staff tried to be friendly but when asked a question they could not help. As long as you don't mind where you stay then it is probably satisfactory but on my next trip to this area I will stay at a different hotel where they appreciate my business and money. Some days our dirty towels where taken for laundry and others they were left in the room. Will be glad when the LaQuinta is ready for guests, that is a first class hotel and that is where I will stay in the future. I suffered a fall and injuried my knee; staff and manager gave the impression they didn't care."
POSITIVE,"Beautiful grounds, Tuscan motif abounds; 2 pools and 3 jacuzzi's, sauna & steam room. Rooms have 2 entrances, sliding door opens onto either balcony or patio with exceptional center court area. Definitely ask for room in newer part of hotel. Ample cont. brkfst with make yer own waffles(coffee was way weak though!) Lots of wine tasting nearby, all weÂ visited comp. because of our hotel choice, passes. Can't recommend it enough, very comfy king size bed plus whirlpool bath in spacious room with gas fireplace. In a word, we were blown away!"
POSITIVE,"I was very pleased with this hotel. Convenient to every thing you would want. Nice rooms, good breakfast, nice pool area. All the staff was very pleasant and the cleaning staff ladies were very very nice. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Branson, MO."
NEGATIVE,"As an earlier review noted, looks like they changed the sign from M6 to BW. Should have followed earlier reviewers suggestion not to stay, due to noise, but given the amount of time that lapsed, figured maybe they got their act together - WRONG. Room was clean, but that is the only positive. The rating is based upon the noise at this property. We had planned on staying two nights, but only stayed one (Wed, March 21). The first night, there were 5-6 males in the parking lot outside their room(s) from about 10:30pm to approximately 1am. They were drinking, yelling and whooping it up, and making racial comments about hispanics and caucasians. As there were several work-type trucks in the parking lot, we figured they must have been staying together at this property. Can only surmise they got a good corporate rate. We called about 10:45 to complain about the noise, and the night clerk said the manager spoke with them. Well, the party went on and on, so either the manager spoke and the ""guests"" chose to ignore, or the manager didn't do anything about it. Needless to say, my DW, DD and I did not feel comfortable or safe here. The next morning, I asked the manager why they allowed the noise to continue for nearly 3 hours. He claimed they took care of it and they quieted down - Huh???? The manager didn't seem to care and was unapolgetic. Needless to say, we checked out and stayed at a HI Express which was much nicer and actually cheaper. This experience was nothing short of pathetic the way it was handled. Our experience has been when there are unruly guests at any hotel, management is usually quick to get the noise makers quiet or have them escorted from the property. Not this one, apparently they condone this type of activity. BW should be ashamed this is allowed to occur. We had a previous experience at another BW last summer in another location, and nothing was done, although the ruccus was nothing like what we experienced at this property. Combined with this experience, I am having serious doubts about continuing to use the BW brand in the future."
POSITIVE,"Great place to stay. Easy to get to, and easy to enjoy. Pros: Great place. Cons: We liked everything. No complaints."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is a bit old and it shows but the rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful. If you want good conversation sit in the bar and talk with the bartender Ish, he is great. I would stay here again. Pros: The staff was beyond friendly. Cons: They missed my wake up call and I was late for a meeting."
POSITIVE,Great room...good breakfast but you should advertise your waffles!! It is very close to the strip and very easy to drive to other locations in and around Vegas. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was also helpful to be able to use the computer area and pick up a snack in the lobby any time of the day. the room was nice and included a microwave and fridge. There was also a nice sitting area which was very comfortable. I am a very light sleeper but had a great nights sleep even though the airport is very close. The daytime noise is noticeable but it was not disturbing during the night.
NEGATIVE,The pool is quite large but part of it is always in the shade. The sunny side gets busy and it's noisy because of some machinery. Here and there around the pool area it smells slightly of urine. The maids trolleys are very noisy.
POSITIVE,"Beautiful, beautiful spot on the beach! We love the whole place - the staff is beyond wonderful. It's a favorite vacation location for our family for years and years. It is a relaxing, refreshing stay every time. Liked: Rooms, Location, Service, Food, Value"
POSITIVE,"Wonderful stay at the Best Western Plus in Ft. Myers Beach, FL! My husband and I were there for a week in September 2011. Our room directly overooked the Gulf, pool and garden with its palm trees, grassy area and flowers. The exterior and interior areas were spotless, well groomed and nicely decorated. We loved having the kitchen in a standard room, which was perfect for the two of us. The staff were really friendly and very responsive. We loved having Wi-Fi over all of the hotel grounds and in our room. The warm, clear Gulf was just steps away from the edge of the garden and the end of the tiled pathway. We loved having the option to sit under the palm trees in the shade and enjoy the breeze from our adirondack chairs. No other property in this area provides a shaded garden to enjoy. Because the white sand, beach chairs and the Gulf were so close to the hotel back entrance, it was very easy to come inside for the restroom or to go to/from our room for lunch. What a lovely, quiet experience at the perfect time of the year. We will return! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,Spent four days at this hotel ( 24rth - 27th) Extremely happy. would definately stay here again. when we arrived my partner needed a dentist urgently. Carina on front desk was fantastic and spent a lot of time trying to find us a dentist after hours. The room was very clean and well appointed. Only wish we had arranged to spend more time here. Beds very comfortable and the transport to the city was a bonus. Hotel not situated in the best part of Vancouver but this was not a problem to us at all. we tried the restaurant on site and this was fine.
POSITIVE,"If you like the ocean, even just a little, this is the place. Hearing the waves crashing just beyond our door was very relaxing. We loved the big screen TV, too. The pillows were the best! So close to Cannery Row and all other tourist spots. Why stay anywhere else?"
POSITIVE,"Nice place for the price. Near restaurants and outdoor activities as well as movies and a huge outlet mall. It is close to five different ski resorts. Pros: Excellent location on Lake Dillion. Comfortable, clean and everything that I expected. Cons: No Air Conditioning. This could be a problem in the summer."
POSITIVE,"AC is not so good, noisy, general very good, service is good and people are nice"
POSITIVE,Your hotel in Fairbanks is always clean and the staff friendly. I did have some allergy problems with the carpet cleaning product used in the lobby and a little adhesive smell in my room (Room 210) regarding the carpet tiles.
NEUTRAL,"The rooms are nicely furnished with plenty of space, however it does lack access to electric outlets to charge devices. The neighborhood leaves a little to be desired. I would not recommend eating at the resturant in the lobby the food was not great by any means. But there numerous places to eat near the hotel, for the price is great place to stayÂ with quick access to the airport."
NEUTRAL,I am just glad that this was one of the unpublished deals and I did not have to pay very much.
POSITIVE,"This was our second stay here, we were pleased with the accomodations, and would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"When first arriving, they had to upgrade our room to a suite. The suite was spacious and nice! Appreciated the mini-fridge. The location was near the freeway and so close to everything we wanted. The only downside was the service. Upon check-inthe staff was curt which is easily overlooked but later our t.v. remote stopped working. When we informed the front desk they simply tossed a few AA batteries to us. When we returned to our room we discovered the remote took AAA's. Informing them again of the issue they simply tossed a couple of remotes our way and said one of them should work. Neither of them worked and one of them didn't even have batteries in it! Lazy effort. That being said, the staff running the continental breakfast was speedy, polite, and tirelessly working to please everyone. Kudos to them. All in all a good stay if you don't have to talk to anyone."
NEUTRAL,"The best part of this Best Western is the staff as they are very friendly, courteous and accommodating. This hotel is located about a ten minute walk from the beach, but very close to the main shopping areas and restaurants. Though the building itself seems outdated inside the rooms and reception area is modernized. There is a small outdoor pool, an outdoor patio eating area, a computer area, and a desk to book local tours. The rooms are up to date and very clean. We stayed in a corner suite room #304 which is the 2nd largest size on the floor plan. It was cozy, bright, clean, had pretty much everything you wanted. The kitchen is very small, containing a microwave, basic cutlery and dish ware, coffee machine, sink, and a small unstocked fridge except for 2 small bottled waters. The washroom was bright, had modern fixtures, good water pressure, and the shower head had great options on it but no bath just a large shower stall. Our room faced north so we had a view of a row of houses, and the busy Ali Wai Blvd and Ala Wai Canal. Only complaint was that our air conditioner unit was very noisy, it sounded like it needed to be serviced. But it helped to cut down on the traffic noise outside and kept us cool. Breakfast is included and is downstairs in the main reception area. It is a good set up however it's a pity they did not offer more healthy options besides 2 types of fruit. And the bread choices is just white or whole wheat. Only hot items are scrambled eggs and mystery sausages. And limited condiments - l could not find the ketchup and this is the States! After breakfast they do leave some refreshments out - 2 types of juice and a very refreshing cucumber water. This is a very nice added touch."
NEUTRAL,"it's a best western. it's by the freeway. it's on the cheap end of things. considering all that, this place is great. we even used the pool a little bit, which they unlocked early because my daughter is obsessed and wanted to swim at 8:20am. In general, the staff was cheerful and helpful. As an aside, I'm not sure why every hotel's free breakfast needsÂ to be an insult to food? Maybe other people really like microwaved eggs and watery coffee and I should just shut up. Sorry, just needed to say that. Back to the review, in the 'you get what you pay for' category, this place is nicer than others."
POSITIVE,"We booked our hotel on line, site unseen as I normally do not do this but it was great. Hotel was clean, staff was great and breakfast was nice. Did not like the train tracks running behind the hotel as one train did go by at 8:00am but was already up. Overall I will stay here again!!"
POSITIVE,"We had a family vacation: San Diego Zoo, Sea World, Disneyland, and Legoland"
NEGATIVE,"For the price not a good deal. Beds uncomfortable, and the staff were not on the same page. Wanted to charge me $30 to upgrade from double beds to queen beds for for each day. so $120 .... crazy"
NEGATIVE,We had a room on the ground floor overlooking parking and a road. Basically our view was of some coastguard equipment and some containers. We couldn't open a window because of the location so the room got quite hot. The staff at the front desk were not very helpful and seemed more interested in their own conversation or in having a quick cigarette outside. The room was in need of modernising and some fresh decoration but it was clean. Breakfast was OK. It was set out in a small room but there were plenty of tables available when we ate. It is also quite centrally located. However in drives through town I did notice other hotels that I would prefer to have stayed at that were equally well located. Room Tip: don't pay extra as nothing here has a great view
POSITIVE,Very modern updated hotel. Full breakfast was a huge plus for our stay. Very clean hotel and staff was very helpful. Would definitely stay there again if our travels take us back to the area.
POSITIVE,We absolutly love staying at this hotel. Not only is it by the main highway but it's always clean and a huge plus they are pet friendly. Each time when traveling cross country we make sure that we stay there!
POSITIVE,"The Hotel was clean, quiet and very well maintained. The only thing we noticed, was that dishes in the hallways were not picked up after 4 hours of room service. Also in the restaurant, the tables were not bused very fast, and there was a cart from the night shift with wine glasses and empty bottles still on the cart from the night before, at 11 A,M. Overall, the food, the service, and the great courtyard and peaceful surroundings were great. We will definetely be back!"
NEGATIVE,Spent my winter break there. Was close to area attractions. Free breakfast was good. Rooms seemed run down and uncomfortable beds. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants
POSITIVE,"Outstanding service. Provide personalized attention to the customers. Best experience so far. As far as Bennington is concerned, this is the best one could get - close to everything (walmart is right behind), cleanliness, nice rooms, good staff. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
NEGATIVE,"I will never stay here again! I am single mom with two boys, 14 & 10. We were driving our way up the California coast and just staying wherever looked like fun. We checked out their website with the pictures of the great pool, jacuzzi and sauna. They also had a laundry room that I desperately needed due to wet, smelly clothes from the beach. We made a reservation and arrived a little early so that we would have time to relax and swim and do some laundry. Well, the bottom line is.........our room smelled HORRIBLE like a terrible smell covered with tons of flowery yuck! The room was fairly clean, but, there were dirty towels behind the bathroom door. After a half an hour of fumigation (I always bring Lysol and Febreeze) it didn't smell any better, so, we opened the window and went to the pool. The pool was ok, but, the jacuzzi and the sauna looked like they had been closed for months. Before we went to the pool I went to do some laundry and there was ONE washer and ONE dryer in this huge room and someones clothes were in both...they were there the entire time we were at the hotel. I had to go to the laundromat down the street. Then.....the next morning I was loading the car and I see a police dog barking at one of the hotel room doors. I was lucky enough to catch the live episode of COPS at the Heritage Inn. I loaded my car that day with 9 police cars within 100 yards from me. I can't tell you how fast I got my kids up and got out of there."
POSITIVE,"They have nice rooms, but the trains across the street are noisy. If you have one of the rooms further away it is better. Room Tip: Stay far from street."
POSITIVE,Everything here was perfect except for the light/air coming in around the door in the room. Left the message at the desk. It would save them on utility bills by adding a little weatherstripping.
POSITIVE,"I stayed at this hotel while on business at Social Security. Not only was this close to my destination and a short drive off 695, it was located in a quiet residential neighborhood. My room was very comfortable, the staff extremely helpful and professional, and the facility clean, attractive, and welcoming. I would stay here again and recommend it toÂ others coming to this area."
POSITIVE,"My sister and I recently stayed at the Gen-X Inn while attending an event at my son's college. I have tried other hotels in the mid-town area and I will be returning to the Gen-X. The hotel is located near several colleges in Mid-Town, yet is a trolley ride away from the downtown area. The lobby and our room were very clean and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. Our room was quiet and well appointed for the price. The staff was very attentive, greeting us each time we entered or exited the hotel, and responded quickly to requests. Over all we had a very positive experience and will be returning."
POSITIVE,good stopover nice grassy area in back ;; ask for ground floor at back ..you can park right outside your room and walk dog in park nearby.. bfk fine ..need to walk outside to go to front area where bfk center is clean ..quiet..constr crews sleep here but no noise good reasonable place iinstead of jasper
NEGATIVE,"Good location, nice rooms, but poor amount of parking, poor access to upper level and courtyard, and breakfast was very disappointing and unhygienic (food placed where people are reaching over, scratching their heads over, and no prevention for anything falling onto the open plates. Staff was very friendly however. Pros: Courtyard with pool and beautiful flowering vines made attractive setting. Cons: Access to rooms was terrible; poorly placed stairways, not user friendly."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was great inside, however, it is right on the highway so it was noisy. The benefit to being next to the highway was it was a quick drive to anywhere we wanted to go. This is a great hotel for a quick stop over. It was very clean. The area is just OK, there is a strip club down the street. But, it is only a few minutes from the race track which also has nice shops and a casino. Cons: Noise"
POSITIVE,Liked: Sue is the Best... And the rest of the staff too...!!!! :)
POSITIVE,"We are from Niagara Falls, Ontario, my wife & I wanted to get away close to home for a weekend. The hotel is very clean & the staff very helpful. The king bed was very comfortable, the room spotless and quite. We will plan another weekend away to shop & relax and we will stay here again. We have already told our friends to join us in the summer monÂ ths."
POSITIVE,"I liked the cleanliness of the rooms, free WIFII, and a good variation at breakfast.I also liked the idea if the lobby being on the 2nd floor so there was no people coming in off the street, and a good location. Unfortunately I got the worst room which I vow never to take as it was next to the lift and coud hear people alighting the lift at all hours and having a laugh and conversation outside my room door which was 601.I also believe the breakfast area is way too small for the capacity of the hotel and guests had to sit in the lounge/computer area for breakfast.I also thin a sign should be put above the computer stating 15mins per person only and also a sign on the waffle machine as some guests were making 2-3 waffles at a time and in the end we gave up."
POSITIVE,"de ligging in china ,"
NEUTRAL,"Fun decoration, mostly nice people at the front desk, and close to many attractions. Too noisy! People were rowdy right outside until 3:30 A.M.! We were tired the next day."
POSITIVE,Hotel was clean and modern !! Room was clean and modern !! Continental breakfast was a great bonus :) Pool was warm and clean.
POSITIVE,The furnishings in the rooms are great. The location is excellent. Millenium restaurant a great vegetarian restaurant is right there. It is by the bart.
POSITIVE,"Easy access from highway and price was great for a 2 night stay compared to other local hotels. Hotel was close to restaurants, fast food locations, and stores. Distance from Army Base Gate was perfect, very little traffic compared to other gates.I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay for BCT graduation, due to price and location. The staff are friendly and breakfast is free."
POSITIVE,"Its location, free continental breakfast, and competitive price."
POSITIVE,The guy at the front desk was great - he upgraded us. The room smelled really musty.
NEGATIVE,"Room: Tiny--with one end table and one chair; no desk. Insufferably hot; thermostat was broken; A/C gave no relief. Clock radio non-functioning. Faucet dripping gallons of water; called about it--no response. Bedding out of date. Hotel: dreary hallways. Only positive was lobby had a very interesting design. Would not return to this hotel, regardless of deal."
POSITIVE,"Driving up, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't surrounded by scenery of woods and mountains, but once inside the lobby, my mind changed! It was absolutely beautiful and full on NW style. We were greeted warmly when we first entered and everything went smoothly and was accounted for. Our room was on the 3rd floor and impeccably clean. The beds were incredibly comfortable and all amenities in the room were in working order. Even the soaps, lotion and shampoo were wonderful smelling products that weren't the basic hotel chain products. Our daughters LOVED the pool, it too was an extremely clean environment and I had to slip into the sauna to get some nice hot air. We were very impressed with our stay. The staff was courteous, the buffet breakfast had a nice variety, coffee and tea was available at all hours and fresh made cookies at the lobby desk disappeared quickly. We will definitely stay again when we make it up that way again."
POSITIVE,"Had a great stay here in the Best Western in Sarasota. Great location, excellent complimentary breakfast and a top notch staff made for an enjoyable stay with no hassles."
POSITIVE,"This hotel has all the amentities without the higher prices. Great access to restaurants, jogging trials, local stores, and even a driving range. Also, the area is located in Mennonite country with farmer's markets and horse drawn buggies - very cool."
POSITIVE,"Nice, quiet and relaxing. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. Pros: Close to beach and walkway. Cons: Pool is small and off the road on the side of the hotel. Location: Plenty of places to eat nearby!"
POSITIVE,My parents have stayed here many times. We went as a family trip and the rooms have all been redone. Large rooms and clean. Nice sink area outside the bathroom. The staff is great. The restaurant on the grounds or next door is wonderful.
POSITIVE,"On arrival was shown to a beautiful balcony room with ocean views. Check in was fast and professional and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location within easy walking distance of moonlight beach, restaurants and boutiques of Encinitas high street was very convenient and the room was very comfortable with the best tv picture I have experienced on hotel flat screens. A convenient and quiet pool with adjacent jacuzzi open till late added to our enjoyment. An excellent buffet breakfast was available until 10:30am in a building adjacent to the pool. Overall, excellent value for money and thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: Ask for ocean view facing westerly."
POSITIVE,My wife and I had stayed at this hotel before and thought that it would be good again. On arrival the room given to us had an unpleasant odour. I contacted the reception and within minutes had the help of the manager and was very quickly given another room ( a better one than that which I had booked) My wife and I find all the staff here very helpful and would recommend this hotel to others
NEUTRAL,"Fireside inn in Kingston, comfortable, two restaurants one expensive one family. Was clean and nice a little run down. Fireplace is electric and emits no heat which I found a little strange. Would stay again, close to the hi-ways so situated more north than central."
NEUTRAL,"The Best Western was a situated in a perfect location, only footsteps to the main strip of Times Square. The staffs at the hotel were helpful the hotel itself was run quite well. I was rather disappointed though with how run down the hotel actually was compared to the images I had previously viewed online. I know you cannot always go by the photos, but I truly did expect a lot more than what was offered. The room we stayed in was a standard room. The room was small, but not too bad but the bathroom was tiny. We could barely fit in the bathroom and close the door while we were in there. All in all, I would stay here again for a quick stop over before moving to an apartment/more luxurious hotel, but for the price we paid for this hotel I was not satisfied with the quality of our room. The breakfast was good, and the staff were lovely, I think the hotel just needs a bit of a makeover.. or they need to update their photos. Room Tip: Rooms away from the road, garbage trucks are quite noisey and come very early of a morning."
POSITIVE,"great value, great service, very helpful staff, especially Juan-Carlos at front desk. perfect for our stay as a family in LA, connecting rooms and confortable beds. Even cheaper price when we booked over the phone. Room Tip: away from roberston road, but it wasnt a problem"
POSITIVE,did not like the pillows
POSITIVE,"I went on vacation here, and it was awsome. The lodge was very clean and nice. Everyone here is frendly it feels a lot like home. The food is wonderful also. Theres a lot to see and do and see. On Saturday and Sunday they have live music. The artist that come out are very talented. It was a great experience."
NEGATIVE,"Ok the usual, rude staff, bellboys unwilling to help and even got some long faces when asked to help, free wifi kept kicking us off, but THE WORST: The night before check out I woke up about 5 am because I heard something. Woke up my husband to check and indeed he saw a MOUSE scrumming through some bags! I'm afraid of mice so I started screaming. I've never had anything like this happen to me before and I've been to a lot of hotels. Called housekeeping and they said they would send someone, it was taking too long so we went down to the front desk and told the guy about the mouse and he said yeah 1415 right, I was just up there but no one answered, well with every little sound I heard I started screaming and I do recall something which sounded like knocking, why didn't he say something or keep knocking? Anyway he told us due to the construction more people have complained about mice! Only on the 15th floor, the smoking rooms, they've not yet been spotted on. He couldn't do much he said we had to wait for the front office manager. He did give us another room on the 5th floor, he did not send someone up with us to help us with our luggage, so my husband had to carry everthing out from the 14th to 5th by himself (I wasn't setting a foot in there anymore) THIS IS NOT WHAT WE CAME TO NYC FOR!!! To be continued"
NEUTRAL,"We spent one night at this BW, one of the good points is the fact that they are pet friendly. This place is really nothing special, rate was higher than other BW's that we stayed at and breakfast was adequate but would have preferred a better selection of hot items like other BW's. Staff was helpful and restrauant in the same parking lot was OK but not particularly accomodating as far as meal choices. It was great for the dog as we had the very last room closest to the dog run. As there is not much choice in Dillion I guess that I would stay again if in the area."
NEGATIVE,"This place is PATHETIC. My wife and I stayed here 1/24 and 2/1 and will NEVER come back. The first night was fine, airport shuttle service was quick and easy (the driver was even kind enough to drive us back to the airport after checking in so we could catch the light rail into downtown) and the room was clean and comfortable. The second night was a NIGHTMARE. We landed, collected our bag and called the hotel. No one answered. I called again and let it ring for 5 minutes! No answer! I called again, SOMEONE ANSWERED in broken english and HUNG UP ON ME. So I called again, let it ring for another 5 minutes and was HUNG UP ON AGAIN. Another couple standing there in the freezing cold with us were also waiting for the same shuttle and were also trying to call the hotel - no answer! After an HOUR of waiting in the cold, my wife flagged down a shuttle driver to a DIFFERENT HOTEL and begged him to take us - which he kindly did. When we all walked into the hotel, the idiot at the front desk said his phones don't work and don't ring there - so I took out my phone and called again right in front of him, and what do you know? IT RINGS! HE ANSWERS - AND HANGS UP ON ME! While I'm standing right in front of him! Absolutely outrageous. The other couple that arrived with us were equally livid and the same attitude from the front desk agent. Since we were prepaid through Expedia we had no choice but to stay, but we'll NEVER stay here again. They're not THAT close to the airport anyway. Beware"
POSITIVE,"I had requeted a handicap room which we did not get. We were told it was not requested. That made it very difficult for my wife. She is in a wheelchair, Other than that the staff was all very friendly and helpful. Tha Continental breakfast was very goodl. The room was very clean. Pros: The staff Cons: No walk in or roll in shower Location: The location was fine and easy to get to. It was a lttle bit confusing at first because there were three Best Westerns on the same block"
POSITIVE,Pros: The room was bigger than expected and well-appointed. Good breakfast. Cons: Nothing.
POSITIVE,I had a small single room which clean and well appointed and exactly what I wanted. I was offered larger double room in the annex which was a nice gesture but preferred the main hotel. The French barman was helpful in directions and information. The dinner in the restaurant was good quality and good value. The Hungarian waitress was very helpful particularly about the variety of cheeses. She had obviously been trained well. Reception staff were efficient and friendly.In all a very pleasant stay. I would definitely stay again
POSITIVE,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we loved it!!! The only thing I didn't like was that their wasn't a microwave in the room but the lady in the lobby let us use theirs. The hotel was close to everything. We only used our car to get home. We left it in the FREE parking area. The tub was amazing, it came with awesome bath saltsÂ and the maids service was great, They cleaned so good. I give this hotel an A+++"
NEUTRAL,"You can't beat the location--so close to Broadway. They fortunately updated this hotel with some fun and funky decor touches and decent bathrooms, but that didn't totally mask the fact that it's an old building and kind of run-down. There's a perpetual greasy garlicky smell in the lobby because of its proximity to an Asian fusion restaurant. The walls are paper thin; I fortunately have a white noise app on my iPhone or I wouldn't have been able to sleep. But the gym was great and the staff was nice. It's a good bet for the money, all my complaints aside. I might stay there again. Room Tip: speak up if you don't want a twin bed"
POSITIVE,"super comfy beds, nice showers, very clean, nice indoor pool. will stay again!"
POSITIVE,"Very good hotel - clean, fancy, best of all great value! We stayed 3 nights for $88/night. King sized bed, flat screen TV, free coffee/tea/water, free wifi, free social hour w/ drinks/snacks, free hot breakfast. We had a jacuzzi tub. I love the option of choosing what kind of services you want (ie: just replace towels or take out trash, full cleaning, or no service, etc). It saves them time and resources. All the staff members were very nice and friendly. Close to various highways for our day trips. Lots of places to eat nearby."
NEGATIVE,"Apart from a superb location this hotel is not worth a second visit. Rude bellhops(hotel employee to assist you with your luggage) who cannot hold open the main door for you when you are struggling with 4 suitcases, unfriendly front desk staff who cannot give proper directions to nearby attractions, unclean rooms at check in including soiled shower caps tucked inside the bed covers was how I started my stay at this place. Although Best western Platinum Elite member, I was offered one of the most lousy rooms which was extremely small, no decent view and was not clean. Phone calls to my room from outside were not patched through as front desk does not bother to answer the phone when they are busy and people calling from outside cannot directly dial your room number; they have to go through the front desk!! A package that was sent to me from Maryland was kept at the front desk and repeated enquires about the arrival of the package from one of the Best Western Hotels in Maryland where I had stayed earlier was met with a standard response that no mail was received on my name. Repeated calls and multiple inquires finally led to the package being ""discovered"". During check out repeated calls to front desk to request a bellhop to carry the luggage down was necessary. The staff was unhelpful, uncooperative, rude and some of them were probably not fit to be in a hospitality business. I have communicated with customer care of Best Western who are normally very prompt and responsive to address this issue. Although a Best Western Platinum Elite member and having stayed at 3 Best Western locations in 15 days, I felt that it is very difficult to avail some of the elusive privileges like ""free upgrade"", ""late check out"" and ""better room allocation"" that are promised on their website."
POSITIVE,Nice place to stay and will use again! Beautiful setting and nice people make for a pleasant experience. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet nice pool
POSITIVE,"My two cousins and I went to Louisville ky to shop and eat. The hotel was friendly and very clean! In the morning the breakfast was very good, hot and had a big selection! This hotel was close to everything. This hotel was one of the best I havestayed at in a long while."
POSITIVE,Well located close to Grand Street subway. The hotel was clean and staff was friendly and helpful. I would prefer that they do not have a 100% cancellation fee on booking confirmation but rather closer to the actual stay as one would use the hotel mainly for a city trip and any thing can happen that one might want to cancel a booking.
POSITIVE,"The clerk of front desk is very kind,most of them are Chinese. Breakfast is a little bit simple."
NEUTRAL,"We asked for the quietest room they had available. We've been told that everyone is placed on the ground floor due to the winter season. First night we heard next door neighbours TV playing all night long, second night, we heard people stomping above us. Although the rooms were nice, spacious and clean, we would not stay there again if we wanted toÂ actually sleep."
POSITIVE,"Fantastic location....staff was very friendly and helpful...Room was cozy and very clean...Overall, we had a great stay here!"
NEGATIVE,"When traveling, I usually do not support the big chains as I am trying to preserve the"" Private Owned Motels"" and help our economy thrive. On this occasion I returned to an old stand by that my family used to visit years ago. Although it was a well known chain, I guess I expected better. The pool and hot tub were clean and refreshing, the front desk staff friendly, and the standard breakfast adequate, the rooms were less than expected. I should be assured clean rooms wherever I go and this one was not. The bathroom had mold growing under the tub,(check under the creases in the surround enclosure) the carpet left your feet black and the window and pictures had not seen windex in months. These are evident areas and set the overall presentation as tacky and uncomfortable. The bathroom light never went off so you close the door at night for darkness to sleep. These are minor issues, yet for the price, a clean room is most important. Forgo this one and try another as I cannot give a good review considering. If a clean room is important to you.......this is not the place to stay!"
POSITIVE,It is conveniently located close to LAX and Long Beach airport. Easily accesible and close to beach. There is a bike rental place across the street and bike trail continues north and south. It's great way to explore the area. Richard
POSITIVE,"Very nice. Pros: Pleasantly surprised at the quality - cleanliness, etc."
NEUTRAL,"My family stayed for three nights. We enjoyed the breakfast which provided a nice variety. The location is in a safe area within walking distance to shopping, places to eat, and near our family and friends. The movies and an outdoor mall are justa short drive. One set-back: Although we reserved a non-smoking room in advance, there were not any available when we arrived. My father booked directly with the hotel the same day and was able to get the last non-smoking room. Their response to this was, ""It is a request not a guaranty when you do not book directly with the hotel."" Fortunately, my father did not have a problem with the smoke room and switched with my family. Both rooms were clean and comfortable during our stay. The hallway does carry a strong smoking scent, but it was not unbearable."
NEUTRAL,"The wide range of comments (from poor to excellent) for this hotel below is surprising but for $80 a nite before tax for 2 queen size beds to sleep two comfortably, no complaints. Only downside is the breakfast offer which is basic ie hard boiled eggs, cereals toast & jam and so- so coffee (this is american breakfast after all) so for the international well heeled traveller, bear in mind this is not a B&W Hotel of global cities notch ie no room service, dinning, range of toiletries etc Free internet/wifi and a fireplace (for warmth in winter). and nearby to Woodburn Shopping outlet are the pluses. There is slightky cheaper room at a rival hotel chain nearby which i rather not named in case you are looking for something to save a few bucks."
POSITIVE,"For the price, you can't beat this place--the Victorian Inn offers a number of AAA and other discounts to take down the room price in a rather expensive area, and the location is incredibly convenient for walking to Cannery Row/Aquarium and getting to the Coastal Trail. Even Pacific Grove is less than a 2-mile walk. The ambiance is great, with decor fitting the name, and cozy, comfortable rooms. Nice perks like the in-room gas fireplace and wine and cheese hour make this one of the more luxurious Best Westerns I've stayed in. The bathroom is standard but very clean. My only complaints are that the continental breakfast has somewhat limited offerings, and the breakfast room is a little small/crowded--however, it's possible to ask for a tray and take your breakfast back to your room, which was much appreciated. Also, the parking fee is a little more than I'd prefer at $13/day. Overall, though, I'd highly recommend the Victorian Inn for anyone who wants to stay in easy walking distance of the Monterey sights."
POSITIVE,"Had a great stay here. Hotel Clerk was very nice.Room was very clean. Pool was nice, but a little on the small size. Hot breakfast was great, but limited seating, although I understand they had additional seatig upstairs. I would definitely recommend this hotel & stat here again."
NEUTRAL,Comfortable bed. The bathroom didn't pass my wife's white glove test. Internet access was spotty in some locations. Complimentary breakfast was very good. Room Tip: Internet access was poor in our room above the lobby (although it was fine in the lobby and the brea...
NEGATIVE,"I booked this hotel as it was close to where I needed to be for business purposes. I was meant to stay three nights, but after the first night, I checked out. The location is sketchy. Walking from the hotel towards 8th avenue--its dark and deserted. The auto body shop across the street seriously does stay open all night and makes A LOT of noise. The lobby and the rooms are tattered. My bedspread and blanket had shredded parts, strings and looked like it was time for them to be thrown out. The smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling by a wire--it was not clean. I couldn't sleep with the noise from across the street. The 'breakfast' in the morning was a joke. The best part of this experience was that the desk manager let me check out early."
POSITIVE,"We decided to get away for the Thanksgiving holiday and do something different...like go to the Outer Banks! Did a search for hotels as we were not going to be there long enough to rent a house for the week. So I searched for a beach front hotel with a kitchenette. Best Western filled the bill although there were a couple of other hotels which were not sold out which would do also.We stayed three nights ($289.69 including taxes) and had a fourth floor room facing the ocean (and the pool, but it was closed; but the hot tub was working). I found out that this was previously a condo and that all rooms had kitchenettes. Apparently they alternate facing either Beach Road or the ocean. There was plenty of room (two double beds in the bedroom) and even a murphy bed in the living room (which came in handy). There were also two TVs, but they were not the flat screens and rather small. The one in the living room (for me) was set too high for comfortable viewing, but at least we got to see WVU somehow win their football game against Pitt. Breakfast was the usual phoney eggs with biscuits and gravy...no meat, but it did the trick. There was also a laundry room with pay washer and dryer as well as a dedicated exercise room. The bathroom area had two sinks (nice) and the kitchen was stocked with all the necessary cooking/eating utensils. But why not a ""5""? The first night there we had constant high winds which caused a ""screen door flapping in the wind"" sound all night long. It seemed to be coming from the ceiling in the bedroom but I guess it could have been on the roof and part of the HVAC system. It really was bothersome so I escaped to the murphy bed to get some sleep. I figured we were stuck with it as the next day was Thanksgiving, but I did report it to the desk. Coming back from breakfast two maintenance men were coming up the elevator so maybe relief was on the way. Either they fixed it or the wind wasn't strong enough to repeat the previous night's banging, but we didn't hear it anymore. So good for them! All in all, this reconditioned condo provided all we wanted at a decent price. Even with the fitful first night, it was a stay worth repeating. Room Tip: Ask for an ocean view room, the higher the better."
NEGATIVE,"Our first and last visit to this motel. Front desk lady was friendly and helpful. That's where the good ends and the bad begins. Carpet felt dirty, bath tub did not drain well during showers, toilet reservoir was loose, Only received 12 or 13 out of 60 some TV channels (no HBO). Free breakfast was horrible. This is very dated motel in need of serious maintenance. A hotel travel coupon book said the motel was rated #2 in Trip Advisor so we took a chance. No way could that be correct. Latest rating in TA was well below that. I cannot recommend this Best Western motel for any reason. Room Tip: Check Trip Advisor before you stay."
NEUTRAL,Had a suite which was a loft with 2queen beds in the loft and couch table and chairs on main floor. Nice layout. Can smell cigarette smoke in the halls and even in some of the non smoking rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. No pool
POSITIVE,A really nice hotel in a great location. We only had a couple of days to see San Francisco and being located right on Fisherman's Wharf was ideal.. All the staff we encounted were very helpful and the idea of a free wine tasting every evening at 5.00pm was a perfect wind down from a day packed with sightseeing. The bedroom wasn't large and the wardrobe was quite small but otherwise it had everything we needed - including free wifi. We were even told at check in to move any thing out of the fridge to make room for our own stuff and told where the nearby supermarket was to buy supplies. Our room was at the back with no view but after initial dissappointment realised that it was probably the best place to be for peace and quiet when you're right in the centre of a major tourist area.
POSITIVE,We enjoyed the hotel and the view was amazing. The staff was very helpful and even arranged a taxi for us. Look forward to going back.
POSITIVE,"I love this hotel. Â I have traveled to Cincinnati several times recently for work and enjoy staying here. Â The location is great, close to everything but not downtown so no traffic and parking is free. Â Also a very quiet, safe neighborhood. Â There is a Starbucks next door and some good restaurants within walking distance, and a pretty good place in the hotel. Â The decor is unique, kind of Renaissance/Tudor themed, but with newly redone rooms (tempurpedic beds and gorgeous bathrooms) with nice touches like electric fireplaces in each room. Â This is a good place if you want a nice, quiet, comfortable room. Â If you want excitement, you will be disappointed."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this hotel as an interim stop on our way from San Diego to San Francisco. The hotel is nestled on a quiet street just a few blocks from Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about local attractions and they had complimentary Monterey and Carmel maps . Our room was clean and comfortable. It had a refrigerator and coffee maker but no microwave. A nice afternoon cheese and wine tasting was available. Breakfast selection was limited but the coffee was good. If driving, there is an underground garage available but there is a daily parking fee. All in all, a nice stay. Room Tip: Close to local attractions"
POSITIVE,"Was expecting so-so motel as it was not as expensive as some but what a pleasant surprise! The front desk people were nice, efficient, room was very clean (even corners of bathroom!) Bed was comfy, had a fridge and microwave. The free breakfast had dee-lish waffles you could make with lots of other options. Left full and happy. Have stayed there twiceÂ now, both experiences great."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel in a great area, handy to many things. Think we got a really good deal for the price we paid. The restaurant underneath/next door was very good also, although the service there was a bit crusty."
POSITIVE,"A nice hotel just of the main intersection in Ticonderoga. It is only one mile from the turnoff for Ft. Ticonderoga. Easily accessible to the town as well. Extremely friendly staff and a great on site restaurant, Burgoyne's Grill. (It is popular with the locals.)"
POSITIVE,"Pros: Big rooms, good location, fireplaces, evening wine and cheese, big breakfast. Cons: Some rooms are noisy, especially those facing the road. There is little seating in the room where wine and breakfast are served."
POSITIVE,"We are a large family that stayed here in one of the family rooms, which had 2 rooms. The hotel itself has access to it's own stretch of beach on the shore of the lake, with it's own spectacular views. It was such a beautiful location. All the service we received was very good and the choice at breakfast was also very good. They have 2 waffle makers so you can make your own fresh waffle, which the kids loved doing, the only slight down side, is to say that if you are staying on a weekend, go to breakfast early! On 1 of our mornings, people were standing in reception eating as there was no room inside or on the patio area outside. It also has it's own pool in case you don't like sand! Overall a great hotel, and it worked great for us with young kids."
POSITIVE,"We spent 2 nights at the Station House Inn (Best Western) in October 2011 for a long weekend in Lake Tahoe. The staff were friendly, the rooms were small but clean, and the ambiance up in the mountains... large evergreens... and a stone's throw from the lake was incredible. The price was reasonable (I think we paid less than $70 a night with a AAA discount), and the breakfast... best hotel breakfast I've ever had. Anywhere. It's run like a small diner with similar quality food (pancakes, french toast, etc.) and Bonnie - the ""hostess with the mostest"" (as she'll tell you) was delightful (and apparently a fixture, as other guests remembered her from a visit 10 years before). Definitely recommended, and we'd definitely go back."
POSITIVE,This is the hotel we stay at when we go to WV. It has always been comfortable and convenient for me and my family. I would advise anyone to stay at the Best Western in Chapmansville WV. Very clean and everyone is so nice and courteious. Rosa in Ohio
NEGATIVE,"We weren't looking for anything fancy...but we didn't bargain for FILTHY! We turned down the sheets on both beds and found hair all over both beds, under and on the pillows. In the bathroom, there was a used face cloth that was left behind, hung over the shower curtain rod to dry. The carpet had not been vacuumed as there was plastic pieces of something in front of the garbage can. We then switched rooms, only to find more hair in those beds and a toilet that was dirty (NOT STAINED, just dirty). They offered us a third room, but by then it was too late! So we asked for new sheets and we made our own beds. These sheets were clean and thankfully we had brought our own pillows. To top it off, the pool's heater was broken, that was the main attraction for our girls since it was cold and snowy outside. No matter what deal you get...DO NOT stay at this hotel!"
POSITIVE,"No complaints other than the padded toilet seat. It was cracked and had foam exposed, which seemed unsanitary. Nice room, quiet."
POSITIVE,One of the few hotles in Seattle that includes breakfast in the price which is brilliant. The rooms were spottless and I have no fault with them. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
POSITIVE,"We stayed her for just one night over Memorial Day weekend. We booked thru the hotel's site and got a AAA discounted rate. Upon check in, we were blown away by how clean and modern the hotel was. Our room was huge! More than enough room for us and our two year old. We took advantage of the indoor pool, free parking, and free breakfast...what more can you ask for?"
POSITIVE,"Hotel had all the basic amenities you'd expect and is near the subway (2 minutes walk to Grand Street station with the B and D lines running up Manhattan) so perfect as a hub for exploring NYC if you aren't keen on shelling out top dollar. It is a block into the Chinatown side of the Little Italy/Chinatown border so lots of fish markets and grocers etc all around - it is not the most pleasant-smelling/cleanest district we visited but didn't feel unsafe walking round which I think is probably the most important thing. The room itself is fine - not huge, but not tiny and with the usual expected amenities such as flat screen and en suite (the latter of which was surprisingly nice for a budget hotel). There is also a free workout room (very small - an exercise bike, a running machine and a cross trainer) and the bonus of free wifi in the room (check that this is part of your deal before booking). The breakfasts are basic, self-service but not unpleasant.All in all, we wanted somewhere we could explore NYC via the subway from whilst not staying in squalour/on someone's sofa/in a guest room of a B&B and this fitted the bill perfectly."
POSITIVE,We chose this hotel because we intended to visit the Precious Moments chapel and it was the closest to it. The hotel is nice for a roadside hotel and lots of rooms. Nothing very fancy but clean and friendly. Room Tip: Standard rooms
POSITIVE,"We stayed for two nights at the Music Capital Inn arrived a little after the check in time (3pm) and were assisted with check in right away. The lobby was nice and clean and the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 4th floor (I had requested an upper floor room at the suggestion of some of the other reviews on here) it was a King bed room and was very roomy and clean, Nice Samsung flat screen television, microwave and frig, free wireless internet and for my husband it had sports channels ESPN and ESPN2. The bathrooms were a good size with lots of counter space and a nice ledge to put your toiletries and makeup on...They even provided you with a seperate washcloth to take your makeup off and face soap (I have been a lot of places but I have never seen this). The bathtub was great good water pressure and always hot water plus it had nice ledge along the back to sit (or for women to shave our legs). The breakfast was just o,k. I thought it would be a little better after some of the reviews I read on here, so it was alittle of a let down. They had biscuts and gravy with sausage chunks in it, scrambled eggs, sausage links, yogart, ceral, waffle station, fruit, and I think they might have had some donuts. They had several juices to choose from (the orange juice was horrible) and milk. We ate pretty early the first day (Sat) prob around 7:30 and found that it was not very crowded and I did not see the tour buses that some others had stated came for the breakfast. I would also like to say that if you forget something...toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, razor, shaving cream as well as some other items that they have this at the front desk and you can go ask for whatever you forgot and they will give it you. The location of the hotel was GREAT...away from the congestion of main street and the landing and so close to everything. The Tanger stores were maybe 6 min away, the landing was about 10-15 min away and Silver Dollar City was 15-20 min away. Overall I would definitely stay here again...great place and great people! Room Tip: I would ask for an upper level floor"
NEGATIVE,"This poor hotel is trying but still needs help. We stayed in a 2 rm suite. The renovation concepts are nice. However the finishing is poor. Our suite had bubbling wallpaper, poorly trimmed wallpaper, carpet that needed restretched and cabinet toetick fell off. The living room has a nice large flat screen TV that you can see from the couch if you look at over your shoulder at a 90 degree angle. Or you could sit at the desk chair 18"" from the screen. The kitchenette has nice granite counters and tile backsplash. Just don't forget to pack your cookware and utensils because there aren't any provided with the room. The couch is a sofa bed--a TWIN sofa bed not mentioned. Taking a shower could double as exercise because you're constantly dodging the either scalding or icy water. The room remained humid, probably because the bathroom fan didn't work properly. The floorplan made no sense. The bathroom door is through the kitchen and the bathroom sink is in the bedroom. So the nearest sink exiting the bathroom is the kitchen sink. We got locked out of our room. Had to hike to the front desk because we though our key had demagnetized. It wasn't the key. Our lock stopped working but no one was available to fix it. We had to stay in for the night or call the front desk when we wanted in our room. We stayed 3 nights. The bed and location were good and they allowed our dog. The only reason we didn't leave after the first night was we didn't want the hassle of checking in somewhere else. However, we won't stay again. Liked: Location Disliked: Rooms, Food, Value"
NEGATIVE,"What a dump! The worst experience I've ever had. The hotel room smells! The carpet looks like the dirtiest, nastiest most file thing I've ever seen. The staff is rude and incompetent. View? WHAT VIEW! You look out at a parking lot. This is NOT why I came to La Jolla. Don't stay here. Run! Disliked: Location, Rooms, Service, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,"A very small but nice clean town. The hotel is easy to access. The room rates were very reasonable and the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. It is NOT a new hotel, but I felt it rated better than I'd been reading on this site. They also had much better ratings on other sites."
POSITIVE,This hotel is an excellent value. The rooms and grounds are well maintained.
POSITIVE,"A pleasant surprise: nice, spatious lobby and rooms, very clean, friendly service, good breakfast. And a location just minutes away from Bryce Canyon."
POSITIVE,"Good location for parents of college students living in Brighton/Alston area Pros: Calm, relaxed environment; front desk staff were excellent Cons: Facility older"
POSITIVE,"This was our second stay here within three years.Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking the Columbia River. The room was large with a sofa and table for eating.Microwave and frig.There were double sinks in the room; toilet and tub were in a separate area. The beds were fairly firm but comfortable.There was a hot breakfast with egg substitute, waffles, biscuits,gravy, and also muffins, juice, cereal, etc. Staff was great. The train below us did not bother us, but we wore ear plugs(better than the ones provided), and left the bathroom fan and ac running all night. I would suggest that if you are a light sleeper to choose a room on the front of the hotel.However, you will not have the spectacular view. Our only disappointment was that the spa was not available (maintenance) while we were there. Room Tip: front is quiet;back has view"
POSITIVE,"We were there to visit Nuevo Progresso,Mex. The motel is located close the bridge there. The service was good. We had a problem with our TV and the night manager came up and brought us one from another room. The breakfast was standard motelfare. We'd stay there again. Nuevo Progresso is a standard Mexican border town. Many dentists and pharmacies. It's supposed to be the most secure town on the border and is a favorite of the winter Texas. We stayed on the main street and went 5-6 blocks shopping and felt safe."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is perfectly located next to the beach and a short walk from the park. The rooms are very clean, the beds comfortable, and security is quick in responding to noise complaints. The basic gym set up has all the requisite weight machines yet does not reserve floor space for a yoga/strech mat."
POSITIVE,I would say to anyone going for a trip it Oklahoma to stay at the best western. rooms were great and staff all I can say is a big WOW to them all really friendly and polite really helpful and took time out for you. we're now looking forward to out next stay A1 all the way well done guys
POSITIVE,"I was staying there with my two children due to my husband having surgery at Kaiser. Location was great for that purpose. A little scary to come back to the hotel with a fire truck parked infront of my room, but didn't seem to be any damage, so no harm no foul. Overall, my stay was decent. The continental breakfast in the a.m. is nice compared to most.Â My 9 year old was in heaven. She even got to make her own waffels. The neighborhood was safe, variety of places to eat very close. Room was ok. Close to the freeway, so you can hear traffic all night long, but for the price, I really can't complain. I stayed here two days prior, and returned to his hotel when I cam back. Overall, pretty good hotel despite of the firetruck."
POSITIVE,"Very good central location to all destinations. Ten minutes from downtown, two minutes to airport, less than ten minutes to Mendenhall Glacier, ten minutes to Auck Bay for boat rides and ferries. Very clean. Helpful staff. Breakfast more than adequate. Would stay there again."
NEUTRAL,Hotel was in a central location for us.
POSITIVE,"We were really pleased with this hotel. Nice out door pool. It was only a half hour from San Francisco and about the same for Napa & Sonoma Valley wineries. We enjoyed the free breakfast and used the free computer in the lobby to look up local attractions. Although we did not go to it, there is a theme park so close we could see it from our room."
POSITIVE,The Best Western Plus Island Palms Hotel & Marina is a very nice place to stay. I would definitely recommend it.
POSITIVE,The price was very reeasonable for the comfort and view.
POSITIVE,"Having been stationed in San Diego for 3 years, coming back to visit was just a return to my ""other home."" This location in Hotel Circle was a great central location with easy access to the 8. After that, all of San Diego was just a short highwaytrip away. The room I was in had a shared door with the next room, which I was unfortunate enough to be next to people that hosted a hotel room party. It was loud in our room, which I guess was from the shared door, rather than thin walls. The staff was kind and considerate, I would definitely stay again."
POSITIVE,"Centrally located, recently renovated, pool on 4th floor. Highly recommend!"
POSITIVE,"Can't beat the location and views. The hotel rooms were on the small side but staff and service were great, friendly and very accomodating. Nice little lounge with cheap drinks and appies at happy hour. Food in the restaurant was also very good."
POSITIVE,"Setting my aside my OCD tendency to stick to things I know, we stayed at this hotel because of the $89 room rate booked online. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room, though outdated, was clean, extremely comfortable and very spacious and the king sized bed was the best one we found during our week long vacation. Our room faced a busy street but the traffic noise didn't bother us at all. Parking was convenient and the wi fi worked like a charm. We didn't try any of the amenities but I feel comfortable enough with our experience that we will definitely stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"When I arrived at DFW, I called for the shuttle. He promised it would be there in 20 minutes. After 3 more phone calls and promises of a shuttle, none arrived. I took a cab after 90 minutes. Another angry couple was at the front desk who hadexperienced the same tales of a non-existent shuttle. There appears to be some shuttle scam going on with this hotel. I would have stayed someplace else (plenty of hotel shuttles come to the airport) if I had not be forced to prepay."
NEGATIVE,"What's a hotel with (1) room doors that open directly to the parking lot, (2) no room service, and (3) everything from the alarm clock to the iron chained down? A motel. What do we expect to pay for a motel on a main street but otherwise in the middle of nowhere? About $65. What did we pay? About $100. If you approach the facility from the front, the portico and lobby make a good first impression. But that and the room rate are the only things that suggest ""hotel."" If we'd paid motel rates, I wouldn't be writingâ¦we've all stayed in motels - they are what they are. But there are a few things I expect when I book a hotel room - chiefly among them is security. There is no security - not even a locked gate - between the street and the rooms. It would have been easier for a would-be trespasser to get to my room than to the gated spa. I also expect that no smoking means no smoking, but I acknowledge that if someone wants to light up in the parking lot, that's probably fair game. But with the parking lot right outside your door or window, you may get odors and noise that you didn't anticipate. Finally - a few comments I'd have made regardless of whether this was a hotel or a motel. The topmost bed linens were stained, the room dÃ©cor, bath, and amenities (like the TV) were dated, the fridge made so much noise we unplugged it, and wifi was unattainable. Pros: Proximity to the Elephant Bar Restaurant (it shares a parking lot with the motel - er - hotel); proximity to the Reagan Library (just a few miles down the road); not a bad walk to a Target, if you need to step out for sundries. Advice: If you have to stay here, research and/or negotiate like heck to get something resembling a motel room rate, arrive mentally in motel mode, and you'll be fine."
POSITIVE,Rooms were fine. Train made room shake at midnight. But wouldn't have noticed if it weren't for my son waking me up. Pros: Candy & wireless Location: Not much out here unless you're looking for wine.
POSITIVE,"positives: courteous staff clean, comfortable easy internet access nicer than other hotels in Lynchburg in similar price range negatives: no microwaves in any of the rooms motel instead of hotel-- i.e., exterior doors"
POSITIVE,"Went to a concert at the amphitheater and stayed here..... Cute room, quick service, clean, and decent continental breakfast. Location isn't the best area and it is right next to the freeway (but the sound of cars wasn't bad at all). I would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Great breakfast area. Well stocked and maintained even though the breakfast room was packed. Very clean hotel in lobby, around parking lot and exceptional in room. Best find in quite some time. Service was second to none. Also, even with outdoor entrances, the hotel felt very safe. Room Tip: Close to front gets you near the breakfast room."
NEUTRAL,Looks like an attempt to repair and clean up was made here. The top comforter had a big stain like someone spilled on it. Hard to regulate the temp in the room.
POSITIVE,This hotel is very clean and quiet. The bed was remarkably comfortable. The hot breakfast was more than adequate. The staff was very helpful when I wanted to use the computer. We had no complaints! We'll stay again when we make our annual trip to the Chicago area.
NEUTRAL,I stayed there only because I had to since my flight from Manila and my flight to Sacramento were a day apart. I reserved a king sized bed but got two doubles. he traffic noise was a bother and the restaurant was over-priced for the quality of food but overall it was okay but expensive.
POSITIVE,"I am very picky about the hotels I stay in & tend to be overly critical but I was very pleased & extremely satisfied with the Best Western Chicagoland - Countryside. My room & bathroom was spotless, very roomy and the king size bed was super comfortable. The breakfast was great and the staff very friendly & helpful. The location is very convenient,anÂ awesome thai & italian restaurant less than a mile from the hotel on La Grange Rd & a short easy ride to downtown Chicago. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area!!"
NEGATIVE,not bad
POSITIVE,"Great management great staff a must if staying anywhere nere area. Comfortable clean beds 42"" LED TV!"
POSITIVE,"Michelle was very helpful when I made our resevations. I requested a KN, first floor, pet-friendly room and that is exactly what we got. The room was huge. The bathroom has two sinks. Refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker. Great continental breakfast with waffles, cereals, bagels, cheese danish, butterhorns and more. Very clean. We will definitely stay here again! Michelle also checked us out and was super-friendly."
POSITIVE,Anytime I am in the Neenah area - Best Western Bridgewood is my place to stay. Check in is easy done by a friendly staff. The rooms are great - spacious - and comfortable - plus they have just the exact suite to match your needs - as the choices are many. Your stay includes a hot breakfast served in their breakfast area - overlooking a nine hole golf course. The pool and outside hot tub are unique - and there is a Ground Round Restaurant and Lounge right on site - everything under one roof. I have also had an opportunity to enjoy their banquet facilities - which were top notch.
POSITIVE,"Loved this hotel. We had a room in the east wing. At first I was disappointed since that side looked older, but the interior of the room was up to date. There was not an elevator in the east wing that we could find. If this is important, you might want to double check this before booking a room. Our room was overlooking the river. Beautiful view. When you check in, you are given a breakfast voucher. You take the voucher to the hotel restaurant for breakfast and you can choose from a handful of substantial breakfast choices..I had the french toast and it was awesome. The pool and exercise room looked wonderful."
POSITIVE,WE WOULD STAY AT THIS HOTHEL AGAIN. EVERY THING FROM THE ROOM TO THE STAFF AND LOCATION WERE PERFECT. I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS
NEGATIVE,"The hotel was clean, and sometimes that's all you need. There are good local amenities, a Target and some inexpensive restaurants all practically walking distance although I wouldn't recommend an evening stroll. The ""breakfast"" is minimalistic. As in I got a cup of OJ and a cup of coffee. Not the hotel's fault, but the Caltrans? guests in the Breakfast Room dropped about 8 ""f-bombs"" in the 2 minutes I was there. I would never stay here with my family, but I'm here on business and just need a place to crash with internet access. Oh - and the Breakfast room is the former Exercise room - - they do *not* have one anymore."
POSITIVE,"After a long day's work, we found this hotel like a home away from home. Very clean and customer focused. Details such as a full length mirror for the women in the lobby restrooms to the ease of access to the wireless internet, 24 hour snacks and hot soup available, etc.... Highly recommend it!"
POSITIVE,Nice Hotel !
NEUTRAL,The hotel is located right off the main street. It was pretty clean and comfortable. The breakfast didn't look very tasty so we went to Corner Cafe down the street and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. Not a bad stay for the money. Pros: Easy to find Cons: needs updating Location: right off main street
POSITIVE,"Several friends and I shared a suite here and it was a great deal for the money.. Had a kitchen, 2 bedrooms, living room, and dining room.. It was only a few miles from Broadway at the Beach and it was close to the ocean.. Overall great location, great spot, and good times at the Carolinian!! Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet"
POSITIVE,"Spent a ""getaway weekend"" in Buffalo at the Best Western. Hotel is in Allentown neighborhood, next to Elmwood Village. Walking distance to farmer's market, shops, restaurants, museum, etc. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was better than the usual complimentary fare (yoghurt, waffles) and we ate in a pretty nice banquet room; daily papers provided at each table. Sunday paper delivered to the room. Staff was very friendly and helpful making recommendations and printing directions. Two small complaints: no full-length mirror in room and the bathroom is one of those split deals with the sink outside of toilet/tub area."
NEUTRAL,We stayed for 3 nights and the room was never cleaned once. We could not believe it. The only thing I liked about the place were the pillows; very comfy.
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff and excellent shuttle bus service. Great breakfast, too. We will stay here again next year, and that will be our third visit. Love the mardi gras beads!"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was great and the room was clean the staff so friendly, I'm so happy with service and looking forward to get back to Vegas. Booking.com. Great service thanks Octavio Lara"
POSITIVE,"Arrived in Columbus, Ohio to attend a wedding. Checked into the Best Western and room was nice and clean with two amply sized double-beds. The room met my immediate needs and I will not hesitate to book future out of town trips at this hotel."
NEGATIVE,"I truly don't recommend it, we choose it because of the continental breakfast being included but had an awful experience specially with the lady in charge of it, the cafeteria was too crowded and she kept on pushing people around to get them off her way while cleaning or picking up, the girl in the front desk was very rude and seemed like she didn't want to be there. She didn'thave a good presentation or attitude (messy hair, no makeup)...anyway we could've stayed in the Hilton for $30 more since the continental breakfast wasn't worth it. ... Cons: Stinks like humid, extremely small room for a party of four."
POSITIVE,Everyone was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and confortable. I stayed for 6 days because it was so economical.
NEUTRAL,the hotel is a little rundown. It needs alot of updating.
POSITIVE,"It was located near everything, and right off the highway k177, It also is a pet friendly hotel. Newly remodled"
POSITIVE,"This is our favorite place to stay on Chincoteague. The location is ideal as it is very near the entrance to the National Wildlife Refuge for great wildlife watching and hiking and convenient access to the beach. The rooms are always very clean, comfortable, and cozy. The staff are very friendly and will go out of their way to be helpful. The swimming pool is well kept and the view of the salt marsh and Assateague Island is delightful. Rental bikes are available at the hotel and the island is a great place to go touring on bikes. The breakfast area is always well kept and the food is tasty. And, the landscaping around the hotel is downright beautiful. There are lots of things to do on the island and the nearby beach on Assateague Island is beautiful and unspoiled with no commercial development or boardwalk. Just lots of birds and wildlife to see and one area for safe swimming with lifeguards on duty in the summer. Chincoteague is a ""make your own fun place"", not a fake commercialized version like many other beach resorts. It's all real and The Best Western Chincoteage Island puts you right in the middle of all this natural beauty. Room Tip: The third floor rooms have great views and are very quiet."
POSITIVE,"the staff was great. On tuesday night they have meet the manager with wine and cheese. I called the hotel and they were on the way to the airport. the pick up was on the lower level of the parking garage. When you see your shuttle you had to wave them down. the hotel was about 20 minutes from the airport. You had a restaurant and laundry in the plaza, the other side of the parking lot. When the hotel took me back to airport, the shuttle dropped me off by my airline which was great. Pros: the breakfast in the morning and the cookies at night Cons: no microwave in the room but the hotel desk let me in the breakfast room to use the microwave Location: restaurant on the corner and across from that was laundry you can wash you clothes."
POSITIVE,"This Best Western was in a great location, offered nice clean rooms, complimentary breakfast, and the convenience of a good restaurant adjacent, and the Boca Diner right across the street."
POSITIVE,"Clean, quiet, comfortable rooms. Friendly, attentive staff. Good breakfast. This inexpensive gem is located within easy walking distance to downtown Coos Bay restaurants and shops. Our single queen room was not large, but it was very clean. It was also surprisingly quiet considering the close proximity of 101. The bed was adequate to our needs, neitherÂ too firm nor soft. The staff was competent, friendly and attentive.. The breakfast was generous with scrambled eggs, sausage, make-your-own waffles, fruit, cereal, juice, milk, coffee and pastry. Surprisingly well made and tasty. We often have occasion to visit the Coos Bay area. We are pleased to have found our ""home away from home"" on the south coast."
POSITIVE,"We wanted a quiet quick getaway from the Minnesota cold and we got a great one. The hotel was very clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, their shuttle and drivers were great. Crabby Bills had great food and an attentive friendly staff. The location allowed us a long walks on the beach and access to other restaurants and bars. We will definitely do it again."
POSITIVE,"This is a decent hotel, a short drive from main downtown Santa Barbara. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The pool is small but adequate in a small courtyard area. WIFI is free and decent quality."
POSITIVE,"stayed as 2 families here. the rooms are big and I believe are to be redone soon but I thought the deco was fine. The views are good , swimming pool clean and breakfast included in the restaurant next door. Breakfast was a little busy and not particularly well organised but for the price and quality of this hotel we would recommend it."
POSITIVE,"Very nice hotel for the price, I have paid a lot more for a lot worse. Had no problems with the staff and a very comfortable nights sleep. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,convenient location. Breakfast was a plus!!
POSITIVE,"I just stayed three nights at this hotel and was quite happy with it. There is nothing extraordinary about the hotel but it has everything you want. It is located very close to the airport and the freeways, so it is very accessible. The room wasgreat and the staff helpful. The restaurant is kind of sad but breakfast is really nice."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Best Western for three days in January. We were probably fortunate to be there during the off season, as the hotel and area in general were full but not extremely busy. We loved our room. Every room had a balcony overlooking the Gulf and we saw dolphins every morning. There is a heated pool which was nice for swimming and just to read. There were plenty of chairs in the grassy areas for relaxing too. The hotel is right on the beach and a very short walk to town. We were able to walk to for all our meals. Everything was clean and the complimentary breakfast had all the foods we wanted (waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt, donuts, coffee, cereal and more!). Would not hesitate to stay here again. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet"
POSITIVE,Full breakfast included cheese omelets and sausage patties. Also fresh fruit along with other usual expectations.
POSITIVE,"I had the oppertunity to finally stay at this fantastic location this past summer with my best friend while visiting my family. All I can say is the staff are AMAZING. They're all so friendly, and helpful. Always smiling! You can't help but walk out of the door in a good mood! The room was great too! With the air conditioning already on when we got in, our room was pleasently cool for check in. Beds were comfortable, and clean, and most importantly- The shower heads were made for TALL PEOPLE. Being 6 foot- I enjoy no hunching over to shower! The pool and hot tub area was clean, and towels were well stocked awaiting our arrival. The night auditer allowed us to stay a little past regular closing hours, after promising to be quiet! Something appreciated after a busy day in town! Breakfast in great too! Great value on the room and with a breakfast that great, you can't go wrong! I reccomed this hotel to everyone! They have all the amentities for travelling families and corprate guests! I'll be back again! =)"
NEUTRAL,"Can't say enough about Cheryl, she really made us feel welcome. There is a washer and dryer there and it's only $4 total to do a load of laundry. Bring your own soap or just buy some at the CVS or grocery store nearby. The air conditioner worked so well, I was kind of chilly, but that's always a contest between the hubby and I. Everything was in fine working order and a mini-fridge in the room for convenience. I do think the room we were in needs some updating with the furniture and TV, but otherwise it's just fine for a budget-minded hotel. Be sure to look at the brochures there so you can get an idea of what there is to do. The Ponce Inlet Lighthouse is a nice trip, then go have lunch at Down the Hatch. The Eco Tour is well worth the trip to get out on the water and have Captain Bob give you a fascinating tour of the intracoastal waterway."
POSITIVE,The room was very clean and the mattress and linens were of very high quality. The breakfast is a full buffet with lots of choices for everyone. I especially liked the yogurt and fresh fruit. Pros: The spa Cons: Outside corridors Location: The location is not the best but we needed to be close to Burbank airport & Valhalla cemetery and it fit the bill. I felt safe walking around outside.
POSITIVE,We stayed one night in this hotel on our way back to Vancouver from Calgary Stampede last month. This hotel has an indoor pool (which none of us wanted to go to) and a lot of mosquitoes (which we all wanted to kill). The breakfast was good with fresh strawberry.
POSITIVE,"We were pleasantly surprised about this hotel. Stopped here after finding a coupon in a magazine. After travelling from the Grand Canyon we were all tired. We had dinner and were straight off to bed.... in fact the most comfortable beds and pillows of our trip. I was bothered by the trains and ear plugs would have come in handy! I would have preferred a ground floor room, after travelling for 3 weeks our suitcases were heavy to drag upstairs. We also slept through breakfast, it closed at 9am, which really is a bit too early and from other reader responses it sounded great."
POSITIVE,"This hotel is an older building. If it were built today, I don't think the rooms would be as large. The employees were friendly. The breakfast was good and as I mentioned the rooms were large (and we had a standard room). The mattress seemed a little old and was not the best. If we had brought our children, I don't think they would have liked the sofa bed. It looked lumpy. Overall, I enjoyed this hotel. I don't know if I would stay here again since I like to be closer to Corporate but my husband said that he would, especially for the price! Also, I was told by a few friends that were familiar with the area not to walk around outside at night. It seemed okay to me but there wasn't really anywhere to walk to."
POSITIVE,"Everything was perfect except for the time it took to check-in. We waited a long time, twice. The first time it took so long we had to leave and come back and check-in after our appointment. The second time we waited quite a while as well. The hotel itself was great. We were very satisfied."
POSITIVE,"very nice, attractive grounds -clean and comfortable rooms in a nice location Heating system made noise , but no place is perfect Pros: landscaping, location, comfort of rooms -interesting historical pictures on wall Cons: noisey heater Location: accessible from vienna and fairfax on chain bridge road"
POSITIVE,"The room was clean, the internet worked, and the bed wasn't too bad. Breakfast was standard fare but good. Parking was a bonus, though we paid a nominal charge to use it. A CTA train station is just 2 blocks away, which was also very convenient for us. I would certainly stay here again if in the area. Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet"
POSITIVE,Good location
NEGATIVE,"Awful overall. Checked in to a boiling hot room. Air con only just switched on.....1 Hr afer check in. Fire extinguisher hangingn off the wall, fridge leaking...worst hotel on our 2 week holiday."
NEGATIVE,"Loved the fact that this was a full service hotel. Had a great restaurant and bar. Best of all the food prices and room rates was an absolute steal. The bathroom was a little small but the room was a decent size. Very well maintained. Very clean as well. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"wonderful park,love the animals"
POSITIVE,This hotel was very clean and quiet. The breakfast had a good selection to please most people. The desk staff was ready to serve the needs of the customer. This is a hotel that I would visit again if I travel to that area.
POSITIVE,"The hotel does not have a room with 2 king beds and sofa as advertised - I booked this hotel because of that. The staff was very accommodating and rebooked me into a room with two queens and a sofa. Overall, nice stay and would recommend."
NEUTRAL,"We were on a 3 day trip to Jacksonville and we choose this hotel as it was very close to the Interstate and also near to most of the shopping destinations. The room was fine but the water here was very bad, it had lot of bleach content. The vending machines were not working and it was hard for us to get any water/soda. Also the breakfast was very average and the timings were very limited. The sleep was good and comfortable. Overall, I would suggest if your visit is only for shopping and sightseeing."
NEUTRAL,"Sheridan isn't exactly the kind of town you'd go out of your way to visit, but on a coach tour we stopped off here, thankfully only for one night. It didn't help that the entire road was being dug up outside the hotel, which made negotiating the rubble under foot pretty tricky, but I'm sure access will be eased on completion. The room was pleasant enough, but don't expect a view...of any kind. Breakfast wasn't entirely inspiring either. Nothing to see or do here. Don't know how the hotel functions on its old computer system. They still used the old flimsy floppy disk system!"
POSITIVE,"Throw your doubts out the window if you have any. The staff is top notch and will go above and beyond to take care of your needs. We have used this Best Western for the last 2 years for a Group Weekend get together. Our group will occupy the majority of this hotel every year. To be completely honest we can be a handful at times and the staff never flinches. They roll with the punches and allow us to really feel at home not matter how out of hand we may get at times. From the top notch lobby to the classy modern rooms and suites this hotel is by far the best money I ever spend. I stay in high end hotels many times a year ranging from $250 to $700 a night and I can honestly say that this Best Western can compete with and exceed my expectations when it comes to luxury. Walgreen's and I HOP within very close walking distance, But you only need IHOP for your 2am cravings as the complimentary breakfast is fit for a king. I can honestly say there is not one bad thing I can say and can not think of one improvement they need to make. Texasbowhunter.com LOVES us some Best Western in Bryan, Texas"
NEUTRAL,Friendly and attentive staff although facilities need a little TLC.
POSITIVE,"My husband and I took a weekend trip to Pigeon Forge for his birthday. We found this hotel, The Best Western Toni Inn on Hotels.com, made a reservation and asked for an early check in if at all possible. We areeived about 10:30 am on that friday morning and the desk clerk told us that the previous guests just checked out so we would have to wait soÂ we thought we would go get the weekend started and go horseback riding and then come back ad check in. Well before we left the office, the desk clerk said let me call housekeeping and see if they can clean that room right now. So we went across the street to Shoneys, had breakfast and came back to the hotel and the room was ready for us to check in to. Awesome.... Conveniently located to all the awesome attractions and there are two trolley stops close by along with Gatlinburg. We will be back and i have been telling everybody i know about this motel. It is awesome. Love the indoor pool."
NEGATIVE,"I signed up for a 3-star hotel with Expedia. This was most certainly NOT a 3-star! The AC reeked of mold. The room was rather squalid. The pool was nice, and the staff were nice. The breakfast was in a cramped corner. All white-flour options. Stay somewhere else!"
POSITIVE,"25-45 minute walk from the old city. Uphill going, Downhill coming back Room was small for 2 adults and 2 older children. Decor, especially colors were somewhat dated in my room."
NEGATIVE,Bugs in the room -live and dead ones. Bed cover was dirty. Kleenex container hanging off the counter-empty. Certainly not worth 87.00 per night. Reception was terrible. Staff too busy chatting to even make eye contact when we checked in. I was not feeling well & weather was bad which is why we did not walk out. Never again would I stay at this location. They do not deserve to have a Best Western Sign outside this establishment.
POSITIVE,Very clean room and well kept grounds
POSITIVE,"La Crosse was a place I wanted to see, as for some reason I've always found the Mississippi to have a certain allure. On a recent summer road trip, I did just that--and got the whole experience staying in a water-view room with a patio at the Riverfront Hotel. First off, I loved that I could walk right to the little beach on the river from my room--big points for that. I spent a good hour and a half resting, relaxing, and enjoying the sunset with the beautiful views. The hotel restaurant was good, and the food was pretty decent. The riverfront lounge was pretty good as well. My room was definitely at the Best Western standard--not ostentatious by any means, but large, with a comfortable bed, and good lighting. The indoor pool is the centerpiece of the hotel, but it was generally quiet and not too crowded. The corridors are secured from the noise by the pool area, anyways. If you had a room that was pool front though, all bets are off. Seemed like there was always a lifeguard around the pool for those with kids. I didn't feel like I got some elite resort experience, but I definitely didn't pay for it, either. I would gladly come back here if I was ever going through La Crosse again, and if you're coming off the highway for a night, it wouldn't be a bad place to treat yourself!"
POSITIVE,"Good value but spartan room. I stayed here instead of more expensive conference hotel to save money. Very clean. Internet access saved me data charges and was reliable. Not a good room if you have kids, though. Pros: Free Internet"
POSITIVE,"Went to Toronto to celebrate the big 3-0 with some friends and found a room online at the Primrose Hotel. This was my first trip to Toronto so didnât know what to expect or where anything was. The lady at the front desk was amazing and not only gave me free maps, but also spent a lot of time giving us tips on where the best clubs / bars etc were and even told us how to get on list so we didnât have to wait in line. The room we had was on the 20th floor and had 2 huge bedsâ¦..definitely not a standard double bed I am used to in hotel rooms. Room was clean and the lady who cleaned the room was nice enough to give us triple the towels in the room. My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator. We were beside the elevator and at one point someone in the elevator kept hitting the alarm button and we could hear it. Weekend was a blast and I LOVE Toronto and cant wait to go back."
POSITIVE,Location near the airport
POSITIVE,"We stayed one night over Labor Day Weekend. Front desk was ok, not the friendliest we ever encountered. The hotel seemed under stocked for the busy weekend as they were 100% occupied and ran out of extra pillows- lean on towels and toiletries. Breakfast was complimentary and plentiful. Pool was a hit as it was heated and included a spa tub. Bed was nice, no issues and the room felt a grade above normal with regards to cleanliness. Rooms had balconies and vaulted ceilings. AC worked well. Would stay there again. Felt safe in the neighborhood and had a nice group of guests staying there. Very close to Leavenworth for a fraction of the cost! Room Tip: 2nd floor is best as their are vaulted ceilings."
POSITIVE,"I like the service, when we check in the front desk notice we are group of 5 and I chose the wrong room online, what she did is she ask me to check the room I chose if we can be comfortable but when I saw it I change my mind because 5 people cannot fit in the room so she said I can change it and gave me other choice and it is suite. Cost more but its reasonable and fair and we enjoy and slept soundly because this room is a better choice for a big family like us. The front desk who check us in even gave us extra pillow, beddings etc. she really make our trip excellent even we check in late.Breakfast is excellent too."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel to play in a 2 day golf tournament. For the price it was very nice. Pros: Room was clean, breakfast very good. Good location."
POSITIVE,"Great pool. Clean and safe rooms. Food from the restaurant was good. Friendly staff. This was definitely one of the best experiences I've had when booking a hotel online, unseen."
POSITIVE,"Don't let the outside fool you. The rooms are beautiful and the lobby cozy plus the hotel is in walking distance to the space needle, 5 Points Cafe and many more great places. We got room 502 and the view was to die for."
NEUTRAL,"They have new TVs, but have not figured out how to deal with the remotes. I had to make 4 trips to the front desk and then take the remote from another room. The desk clerk wouldn't listen to the problem so he couldn't solve the problem. Pros: Location, price. Cons: Staff."
POSITIVE,"This motel was perfect for our needs. Great location, very clean and good pool. It was a 5 minute walk into Calistoga - grocery store and lots of restaurants. The room was quiet - we slept very well. Helped no doubt by 18 holes of golf and a swim each day! Service was fast and efficient both arriving and leaving. We stayed for three nights at the end of September 2011. We usually stay at the Napa end but have been staying at best westerns lately and been pleased with them so we decided to give the other end of the valley a try. The Silverado Trail - just as fast as the main highway but way less traffic - runs about a quarter mile behind the motel so the location was perfect for us. All golf courses were within a 45 minute drive and what a beautiful drive it is - through acres of vineyards and wineries. We will go back to this motel and I would not hesitate to recommend it."
POSITIVE,"Liked: Rooms, service, and hot water"
NEUTRAL,We disappointed at room first. The smell was not fresh. But the swimming pool was big and nice and clean even though temperature of water was too cold. And the free breakfast was excellent.
POSITIVE,"We were looking for an affordable hotel close to DFW that provided shuttle service. We found all of this in the Best Western Plus DFW airport Suites. The shuttle service allowed us to turn in our rental car the night before our early morning flight - a real plus at DFW, where all rentals are 10 minutes off-site from the airport. The room was very comfortable and clean, although it could use a little modernization. We didn't take advantage of the continental breakfast due to our early departure (6 a.m.) but did enjoy our in-room coffee. All in all, an excellent price - clean hotel - friendly staff - yes, we'll definitely come back. Pros: Bed was very firm and comfortable Cons: Coffee in the breakfast area wasn't that great. Location: Very convenient to DFW and easy access from the highway."
POSITIVE,"In Nov. I pulled off I-25 looking for a place to spend the night after driving 10 hours. From the exterior the BW Montezuma looked pretty new so I gave it a try. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the free breakfast was great, not the continental breakfast I had expected. The room was really nice and quiet. I would definetly recommend this hotel and will be staying there again when my travels take me through New Mexico."
POSITIVE,Nice hotel.. Would stay again
NEUTRAL,"My Husband and I stayed at this property for a last minute weekend getaway. It was just about the last hotel room left available in Banff over the long weekend and we were lucky to get a room, especially seeing as we also required a pet friendly property! The hotel was adequate. We were impressed with the room itself, very good size and nicely outfitted. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern and clean. We did however find the room was warm during the night and the air conditioning was not very effective. We found the location to be just a bit far from the main strip, but that didn't bother us too much. We also found the hot tub was not very hot during our visit, we didn't stay in it for very long. The complimentary breakfast was a welcome bonus to the price of our stay, although the quality of the food was not the best, it was comparable to other free hotel breaksfasts I have experienced. We would stay at this hotel again if we were in the area and believe the value was good based on the price we paid during a summer long weekend in a hot tourist spot!"
NEGATIVE,"Room was confirmed to had been cleaned and was ready for us by front desk clerk. Less than 30 minutes after inside room, a staff member knocked once and proceded to use his card to access our room despite us yelling to stop. Seeing us inside the room the staff member left. Front desk had no excuse for why a staff member would try and access our room.Â After this incident and no apologies from staff, we felt that our belongings weren't safe in the room (though nothing that we are aware of ever occurred during our stay)."
NEGATIVE,"Pretty noisy. I was by the ice machine and soda machine so that did not help. Amazing how many people need ice at 2 am! Â A friend was in another area and he was hearing noise from the lobby. Shower had vey little pressure. Beds were OK. The free breakfast was good and not at all what you think of when someone says ""continental"" breakfast. I was thinking juice and small muffin. They had cereal, pancakes, waffles, eggs..."
POSITIVE,"The exterior decor wasn't much to look at, the rooms were adequate, the front desk, especially Paul, was very helpful, the price was a bit higher than it should be, the breakfast was fine."
POSITIVE,"Stayed at this hotel over the weekend and was so impressed. At first we rolled into town and ended up at the wrong best western. After speaking with the front desk there I was sorta bummed out since they had mentioned they were a newer property. I began to think I had picked the wrong hotel since the one I was suppose to be at was still another 20 minutes driving and older but when I got there my mind was changed instantly. The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming, we even got a goodie bag for our 2 dogs. The room was clean and comfortable and incredibly large. I would recommend the deluxe rooms since it was only a few dollars more but well worth it. In the morning we had a buffet breakfast and later that day checked out the city. The hotel is in a great location close to lots of shopping and restaurants, it even has a great pool that they let us use even after our late checkout. We loved this hotel so much that we have booked with them again and have also recommended it to our friends as well."
POSITIVE,"This was our first stay in the BW King Charles Inn, and our first visit to Charleston. We chose this hotel because of its location and its free parking. We would go back because the staff is terrific (friendly and helpful), the room was lovely, and the bed was very comfortable. Room amenities (safe, bathroom supplies, tv, hair dryer, makeup mirror)Â all appreciated. We told our friends who live in Charleston to recommend this to visitors."
POSITIVE,I was nervous about staying at this property but it was fine . It is old but was clean and the beds and linens were quite nice . The carpet appeared new and the bath tub also new so not bad. The only thing was the breakfast couyld have been a little better. Would use again.
POSITIVE,"Good location, helpful and informative staff gave lots of suggestions for dining, walking tours, ferry routes. The garden was pretty and there was a nice sitting area outdoors. The window beside the bed where people walk by made me uncomfortable. The coffee served for breakfast was not good, There was shampoo but no conditioner - I do not travel with these items."
POSITIVE,"We had a delightful stay at this hotel for two nights and would thoroughly recommend it while staying in Kelowna. It was about 10 minutes from downtown away from the expensive resorts and the lake, however we had a car and so this didnât bother us. We had a friendly greeting upon arrival and noted that the reception area was consistently busy, efficient and friendly. We stayed in an executive tower room on the 7th floor and it was roomy, very clean and had a full range of amenities needed. A great hotel!"
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very nice and did everything they could to make our week-long vacation comfortable. Great location close to the beach. Breakfast was awesome, they did a great job of keeping it stocked up. Fast computers/internet. Friendly front desk and housekeepers, including the managers!! Room was older but clean and comfy."
POSITIVE,"Little pricey, but very nice. Great breakfast"
POSITIVE,"Got a discount ticket at the GA welcome center on I 95. Hotel was a little tricky to get to, but the price was right and the hotel was super good. Bed was comfortable, room was large and clean. Desk service was very good. Several resturants in the area. Close to Savannah without the traffic. Breakfast was typical, but good. Would stay there again."
NEUTRAL,"A classic 60s hotel, struggling to be modern. Central location, well kept rooms."
POSITIVE,"As we were visiting the area for Sonoma State University Graduation ceremonies and all of the good hotel/motels closer to Rohnert Park were filled, I found this hotel as an alternate. The rooms were large, clean, well supplied with toiletries andtowels and most of all quite. In the morning, we were treated to a self served buffet breakfast which was actuallly pretty good. As a plus, there is a Starbucks located next door."
POSITIVE,"Room & bed were comfortable. Good value for your money Washroom very small only one person at a time. Hotel layout somewhat odd shapped, services are located on multi levels, ie: pool on 2nd floor, dinning in lower floor at very back of hotel"
POSITIVE,overall very satified with hotel & staff separate living area w/fridge&micro a nice supprise for the price ice mach. in separate building a minor inconvience
NEGATIVE,"Our standard room with double bed was very cramped. The bed was in a corner, against the wall on 2 sides. There was minimal floor space on the other 2 sides of the bed. By the time you put baggage in the room, you will have little room to maneuver around the 2 sides of the bed that are not in the corner.The bath was worse. When sitting on the toilet, your knees bang against the front of the shower enclosure. To get to the sink, you have to thread your way between the shower enclosure and the toilet. Once you make it to the sink, there is basically one position you can stand in, limited by the sink in front and the toilet immediately behind you.It's a shame that the room is so cramped because the furnishings are very new and well-chosen.The location has pluses and minuses. On the plus side, you are a 2-3 minute walk away from the Earls Court underground station (subway), which can take you wherever you need to go. Also on the plus side, this is a lively area with many coffee shops, restaurants, grocery and liquor stores, etc. On the negative side, there are few attractions within a short walking distance.Overall, I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the relatively high cost, tiny sleeping area and bath, and absence of any tourist attractions in the immediate vicinity. However, if you have a particular reason for being in Earls Court and don't mind cramped quarters, this is a well-appointed and well-maintained hotel."
POSITIVE,Very pleased. Makes an excellent option for staying in the Theater District for a more reasonable amount.
NEUTRAL,Rooms are comfortable but the lady at the reception was not very smiley and helpful. I waited at the desk to ask for swimming pool towels and the lady never showed up. I had to use my room towels. Continental breakfast is O.K. You can make your own waffles.
POSITIVE,"This was one of the best Best Westerns we've ever stayed at and I've been to a lot of them all over the northwest in my business. We decided at the last minute to squeeze in a trip to beautiful central Oregon for part of our spring break this year and were lucky enough to score a three night stay at this hotel. We have two dogs and this hotel is nestled right up against the Deschutes National Forest which was a big bonus for us. We took long walks with the dogs into the forest in the evenings. The site has friendly llamas that the kids can feed anytime they want to, lots of wild bird feeders (saw a couple of rare desert morning doves), big mule deer at the property line every day and a noisy owl at night. It was a wild life and outdoor lovers spot for sure. The rooms are larger than most. The staff were super friendly and accommodating and we will DEFINITELY come back again. SIsters, OR is a beautiful little town too."
POSITIVE,"Everything was great. The front desk was very helpful. The room was comfortable. Would have been much better if the room was sound proof. A drama queen had twisted her ankle outside my room, and paramedics were called. It was only loud for maybe 15 minutes, but it was just after I laid down to go to sleep."
NEGATIVE,"first day check in the room is soaping,I had to move to another room.and the room still have the bathroom problem,the bathtub not drained and took a whole day water still sit there.and I had to moved again."
POSITIVE,"The room was a great value, clean, internet included, etc. Even had fruit and cookies at the check in desk. My only complain is the room layout. As you enter the rooms, the sink and bath room are up front. The sink is out in the room and not behind a door or partition with the tub and stool."
NEGATIVE,This hotel was dirty and we would not stay in it again. Cons: Nothing close No free Internet Noisy
POSITIVE,"Great hotel, looks almost brand new but i guess it has been there a few years, they gave it a makeover. We got a smoking deal on it through a coupon which made it affordable, but will probably check it out next time I am in the area. The section of town it is in doesn't fit it's profile but there are a few other newer hotels and fast food spots on theÂ strip now. Easy to get on the interstate and pretty quiet to sleep there."
NEGATIVE,"After a 6 + hour car ride, we were given a room that was either occupied or just vacated as there were towels everywhere, bed unmade etc. They said someone would be there in a few minutes. After my son and I stood in the room staring at each other for 15 minutes, we dragged all of our luggage down and went to the front desk. The woman was nice and blamedÂ the error on the computer. We were given another room without a pullout--the former room was a King (as they ran out of 2 bed rooms) and had a pull out. There were hairs in the bathroom of the new room...like on the toilet paper on the roll....The room was otherwise adequate. The included breakfast was ok except for the inedible moon eggs..Would not stay in a Best Western again-- We travel alot and usually stay in a Comfort Suites which has consistently met or exceeded our expectations."
NEUTRAL,"This is an older hotel that likely saw its best days when Nixon was the President. Having said that, for the Phoenix area, it was good value for the price paid. I do a lot of price comparison and it was 20%-30% lower than any other properties. The rooms, tv, and amenities are dated, but it was clean and reasonably comfortable. The fridge in the room is always a bonus for any type of extended stay. The courtyard area is very nice and it was a treat to wake to the chirpping birds. There was a back door entrance to a massage parlour in the back alleyway, however the parking area has lots of lighting and I did not feel unsafe. No free breakfast which is not the norm these days, but I guess with the cheaper nightly rate - it is what it is."
POSITIVE,"We have now stayed twice at this Best Western. We park there, spend the night, return a week later, spend another night and pick up our car. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the wifi works, the breakfast is good, and the hotel staff, both behind the counter and the drivers, are friendly and considerate. The only small complaint I have is that the TV is angled in such a way that you can't watch from bed."
POSITIVE,"The good: Free parking (though only about 20-30 spaces and a very small and awkward garage to get in and out), great front desk service, free internet, close to train into NYC, breakfast included. What could be better: shower did not work even though left a message to hotel to fix. All in all, OK stay and good value compared to hotels in Manhattan."
POSITIVE,"It was like staying home- good breakfast, clean room, quiet atmosphere. There are a lot of dining places and shops around and nearby. Stuff of this hotel is doing excellent job. Thanks a lot. Definitely will stay there again. Gozel"
POSITIVE,"This property is located at a busy intersection on the edge of Old Town/Downtown Scottsdale but it is absolutly a dream place to stay and priced very reasonably. The room was comfortable, spacious, quiet, clean with everything you could need. Nice pool, giant chess set, lovely ""meditation"" area with a gazebo. Just a beautiful place. The front desk representative was pleasant and helpful. We did not visit the lounge or restaurant (which is only open for breakfast) but I am sure the quality is the same. Our air conditioner broke and the parts to fix it were not available for a couple of days. So after literally sweating it out one night with triple-digit temperatures raging in Tempe we looked for a reasonably-priced place to stay while earning points from one of our rewards programs and stumbled on this place. I am thinking about blowing out the air conditioner fuse just to stay there again. Room Tip: The rooms face inward to the courtyard so you do not hear any traffic noise."
POSITIVE,"We stayed prior to, and following, a cruise and were very happy with what we got for the price. We booked through the 1-800 number and were served by a very helpful gentleman who got us the 'fly, stay, and cruise' package -- includes the shuttle to the ship (savings of $12 p.p.). The hotel is older, but has newly renovated bathrooms, comfortable beds, is neat and clean, and has very helpful and friendly staff. The breakfast is great and is served in a large area that becomes a restaurant in the evening. We stayed 2 nights and it appeared to be a popular place since the breakfast area was packed both mornings. The only downside to this hotel is its location (far from downtown) but they do have a shuttle that will take you to a mall (which we did not use) as well as the free airport shuttle (easy to book at the front desk). We got back early from the cruise, and although our room was not ready, they gave us a secure place to store our luggage and gave us a room as soon as one was cleaned. Excellent staff."
POSITIVE,"try to stay at hotels with a pool because we are traveling with kids that way if we need something for them to do it is not another expense. the rooms are very good side and quite. However, the pool was too cold to use, when we asked about it we were told that if we don't like it to call the Dept of Health which made no sense and opted out of using the pool!"
POSITIVE,"very close to a large amount of restauants and shopping. golf course next door,and easy accsess to i 94."
POSITIVE,"For the Money this hotel covered it all. Front desk staff a bit slow on the uptake, but pleasant and curtious. will be staying for a week again in 2 weeks time. One day the housekeeping missed my room, I was out of my room by 10 am and even hung out the ""please make up room"" sign, but some how they overlooked my room. It didn't matter in the long runÂ since the front desk was able to supply the morning coffee pack I needed and I was one person so I still had towels left. would definately recommend it for the budget minded!"
POSITIVE,"Ocean view with a balcony or partial ocean view...either way you will enjoy your stay since the beach is just footsteps away from your room. We opted for the less expensive partial ocean view and discovered that our room was in the annex down the road from the main building and the tower. However, the access to the beach was the important thing for us. The room was spacious and recently updated which was nice, and the free Wi-Fi was an added plus. The room also had a refrigerator and microwave. The only down side of being in the ""Annex"" was that it is 3 buildings down the road from the main building where breakfast is served; so on a rainy day, the walk down the road is a pain...especially with no sidewalks on that side of the street. Also, the seating in the breakfast room is very limited. On nice days, there is outdoor seating, but when that seating can't be used on rainy days, it makes for crowded conditions inside. The breakfast is good, though, with waffles and eggs along with the typical hotel breakfast fare. The staff was friendly and helpful. When you want to go to the beach, it's all about location...and this hotel has a great location whether you are in the tower, main building, or the annex! The tower also has the indoor/outdoor pool, lazy river, Tiki Bar, and the workout room. The main building has another pool and small kiddie pool. And all of the rooms in the tower and main building have ocean views with a balcony. But it you want to save some money, the rooms in the annex with the partial ocean view work just fine. We loved being able to store our beach stuff in the trunk of our car right out in front of our room, and the option of walking back to the room for ""refreshments"" or bathroom breaks was really convenient. We would definitely come back again!"
POSITIVE,very nice owner with big smile. It have had one of the best customer service so far.
POSITIVE,I enjoyed the view of the mountain with the lush greenery. I also enjoyed the pool area and the atmosphere. I did not appreciate the hidden $75.00 security deposit that they assured me would be refunded. I did not receive any paperwork/receipt stating that they billed my credit card and that I would be reimbursed this money if the room was in order.
POSITIVE,"Corniela and Leon were very friendly, helpful and professional. The room was clean, and updated. The beds were a bit firm, but overall a good value was offered for the cost. I would most certainly stay again."
POSITIVE,Great location and better than I expected at the price range I paid.
NEGATIVE,This hotel is the worst we have stayed in. The first room they gave us (201) the sheets had blood on them. After some attitude from staff my room was switched to (301). This room had bed bugs crawling all over the mattress and after I called downstairs to change my room they told me no. I asked the person on the phone what was his name he told me that he could not give it to me. I asked for GM name he said he could not give it to me. We did not stay at hotel and still was charged for it. Room Tip: There is no good rooms.
NEUTRAL,"Unsupportable noise of the air-conditioning system in the room and even worse coming from the outside, as one side of the hotel is overlooking roofs with huge air-conditioning systems of the nearby restaurants. Impossible to sleep."
POSITIVE,We were very happy with everything about this place. (Except the elevator which ran about .1 mile an hour.) The room was spacious and very clean. Laundry facilities were convenient on the third floor. There was a free cocktail in the early evening and cookies and milk later on. Nice touch. Flat screened television . Would definitely stay again.
POSITIVE,"Very clean, nice staff. Great place to stay for a weekend snowboarding trip."
POSITIVE,This hotel worked perfectly for us. It was located about a 5 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale which is adorable! The room was super clean and updated. It fit 2 adults and 2 kids great and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I loved the aviary in the courtyard and the pool was even cute. The only thing I didn't care tons for was having to park in the back of the hotel which is along an alley. At first I was concerned but once daylight hit and I could see around the neighborhood I was no longer worried. All in all a fantastic place to stay for such a low price. Pros: Free Internet
POSITIVE,"Newer hotel in Fairbanks and my favorite place to stay there. Affordable for the off season Alaskan. Rooms are great with pillow top bed (SO comfy) and everything is very clean. Breakfast is good as well - offers more variety than other included options at different hotels. Friendly service as well. No airport shuttle but hotel will cover the cost of your cab from the airport. I've recommended this hotel to everyone I know and will continue to return. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Food"
NEUTRAL,"Price was the only factor in our decision to stay at Best Western Seven Seas. Our room was not clean. There were Dorito bags on the floor and hair in the shower (not in the drain, but on the walls). When you clean, you have to completely clean from top to bottom. I could hear someone trying to open our door with a card key at 4:00 a.m. I didn't feel safe. A low room rate is just not worth it."
POSITIVE,I was not happy with the area of where this hotel was located. It was easy access from the freeway but I didn't feel we were in a good area of town.
POSITIVE,Best Pre-Cruise Stay. My husband and I stayed at the Long Beach Best Western Golden Sails Hotel before our cruise to Mexico. We stayed the night prior to the cruise and a night after. We found the hotel to be very clean and quiet. Free hot breakfast each morning was more than expected. They provided a free shuttle to the Long Beach cruise terminals. They also offer free parking for guests who are driving while they are on their cruise. We found this a very good place to stay with great rates. Hotel staffs were very friendly and made our trip to Long Beach cruise enjoyable.
POSITIVE,The staff is very friendly.
POSITIVE,"Looks more like an elegant b and b, than a Best Western! With a comfortable, charming lobby with a nice sitting area, a roaring fireplace and the scent of chocolate chip cookies in the air - they had me at ""Hello""! Service was friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Bed was comfortable. I felt this place was a great value with free wi-fi, breakfast and afternoon cookies and milk. Plan on driving as there are no eateries within walking distance. Room Tip: Double check booking if you want a room with a fireplace. The reservation website does not make it..."
POSITIVE,Very nice and clean. Staff helpfu.
NEUTRAL,"Housekeeping staff was wonderful and the room was clean but was pretty beaten up: holes in the walls, a large (3 ft/sq) spakle job that hasn't been finished, bubbled wallpaper, molding coming lose and a strong smell of dog urine. Will look to nearby hotels next time."
POSITIVE,"great hotel to stay for a night or two...very clean rooms! looks like they remodel the rooms, very nice!"
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the past couple of years and intend to come back again. Close to Old Town where we love to eat and lots of walking experiences. Rooms are always nice with everything we need. We got one close to the pool this time and it was great. Keep going with what you have - it is wonderful. PS Good restaurant on site tooÂ for late night snacks, etc."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for two nights in a suite on a trip to the Grand Canyon. A splurge that wasn't cheap but it was nice. Amenities included 2 flat-screens, filled shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion dispensers, Keurig coffee maker, nice shower with jacuzzi tub and comfy beds. The free buffet breakfast was fairly good. The hotel restaurant was also nice. The pool was closed, however, because it's seasonal only. The front desk, servers and other staff were very nice and helpful. There is a small arcade and bowling alley, which is great for the kids. The biggest negative is the difficulty with wi-fi. We sometimes couldn't connect at all with our iPads and when we did, it was ultra S-L-O-W. We would probably stay here again if we couldn't book a room inside the park."
POSITIVE,"We liked the convenience of the shuttles, friendliness of the staff and the price. The room was large and comfortable. It was clean and quiet. If you don't want to or can't afford the prices in Manhattan, this is an excellent alternative. We were in the City in less than an hour for the low price of $2.50 each way, senior discount. The regular price is $5.00 each way. We arrived at NY Penn station and from there we could catch subways to everywhere we wanted to go. I will certainly plan on staying here when I visit in the future. The coffeemaker in our room leaked water. Otherwise, it was just a great place to stay."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is not a great place for kids. There is no pool and the rooms are small. They wanted to charge $20 per night for a rollaway bed. Pros: Free breakfast. Cons: Location, amenities, and cost."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel is okay for staying, the mattress is old, low quality, old TV, nearby highway (could hear noise from the highway on one side. The hotel is clean, the items they are using are cheaper and low quality. I always visit LA, the hotel maybe better than others nearby. Free breakfast is good from 6-10AM."
NEUTRAL,It was near the airport and 2 minutes from where we park for our early flight out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The neighbors seemed to have problems and argued in the hallway a few times. They were short but loud. I think the doors and walls need to be a little more soundproofed.
NEUTRAL,Pros: The proximity to the beach. Cons: The grounds were not clean. Littered w/ cigarettes.
POSITIVE,"Very unique in the world of Best Western. Slightly out of town and traffic. Very conveniently located. Breakfast just fair. Room was super-sized, and overlooking pool..not parking lot. Cute ""bear"" motif. Excellent moderately priced restaurant next door (Gunbarrel Steakhouse)."
POSITIVE,Happened to catch the shuttle from Seatac after only 2 minute wait at 12:30 AM--lucky but helped make the experience less stressful. Nothing exceptional about the hotel facility but it provided a nice breakfast as part of room rate.
POSITIVE,Rooms clean and quite. Close to Hillview street which has nice restaurants. Easy to drive over to beach area
POSITIVE,"The room was very clean, and the waffles at breakfast were yummy!"
POSITIVE,"Spent the last 2 nights at Prestige Sooke, this new hotel is very clean with a helpful staff. Room was very confortable with all the amenities. Tanis (front desk ) provided exceptional service,very helpful, knowledgable and friendly. We will be back"
POSITIVE,"Our family just returned from a trip to Victoria/Campbell River and stayed one night at the Carlton Plaza. We had three rooms (Two Rooms with Queen beds and One 2 room suite with kitchen) and wanted a place for the night awaiting our flight home. All rooms were well appointed and very clean. The two room suite had lots of room for 2 adults and 3 small children and had all that would be required for a long term stay...nice suite. The free valet parking was an added bonus, as other hotels charge in that area. Service was good ...asked for a crib and it was there immediately. Quick checkout and two blocks to Hwy 17 and your headed to the Airport! Room Tip: Valet parking free...nice touch. Call the front desk and your car is there in 10 minutes."
POSITIVE,Female manager (think it was Shauna) was very helpful and friendly. She offered to take me to the closest train station and dropped me off on time to meet my colleague for our work appointment. I really appreaciated that. Annette
POSITIVE,"Initially concerned about extreme reviews - great to not so great. We spent 5/28 and 5/30 (5/29 was full) there and can say definitely closer to 'great'. Room 329 was spotless - wife loved the big dual sink. This section had been remodeled in recent year or two. It was not as noisy as some reviews mentioned -more a function of inconsiderate customers than the hotel walls; no wall thick enough to shield drunks noisly staggering in at 2AM. Both days (2AM 5/28 and 12 noon 5/29) the front desk staff was professional, gracious, and extremely helpful. Room 308 (5/29) was nice, overlooked pool and seemed a bit quieter. However, there were a few (2-5) ants in the otherwise spotless restroom. My house has the occasional ants so not a big deal to me. Breakfast was pretty good, but can be crowded (Memorial Day holiday) Overall a great place as home base for visiting Avenue of the Giants."
POSITIVE,"This Best Western provided a great stay with clean rooms. It is very predictable though, so don't expect the high quality of resort. Great location. Minutes away from Colonial Williamsburg. Wonderful Belgian waffle maker. Large and warmpool. The only true downfall was the promise of baked cookies and receiving any :("
POSITIVE,"Just spent the weekend at the Eden Resort and was treated like a VIP. Every employee, from checking in at the front desk to the housekeeping staff when checking, says hello with a smile. My room was clean the temperature was perfect. The Sunday brunch is second to none in Lancaster, there is something for everyone, and a lot of it, LOL. There are prices for the brunch for different age groups, fantastic. I'd like to thak the management and staff for a fantastic stay/experience! Room Tip: Call ahead for brunch reservations!"
POSITIVE,"When we requested a ref., they immediately brought into our room. So kind. Pros: Close restaurants Quiet"
POSITIVE,"My wife and I have stayed at the Carlton Plaza (the ""CP"") 3 times since 2010. We are in our mid thirties and travel extensively for both work and vacation. Overall we found the CP to be clean, quiet and staffed by well trained employees. Most impressive, however, was the politeness and responsiveness of the front desk staff; their approach rivals that of some of the top hotels we have stayed at in the great cites of Europe. Our rooms were well kept and very large. The cleaning staff are clearly passionate about their job and take it very seriously. I've stayed in ""luxury"" hotels where the staff are experts in ""surface cleaning"" and you end up finding hairs and other disgusting souvenirs scattered throughout the room. At the CP I have never found any reminders of previous guests. It's obvious that the building is older, however the extensive renovations coupled with the attention to detail, give it a very ""new"" feeling. There is no scent of cigarette smoke, mildew or anything like that. The lobby is well lit and immaculate. Our beds have always been comfortable. On our second visit (January 2011) we requested to change our pillows and the staff were thoughtful enough to offer us a selection (narrow, fluffy, firm, etc). The CP is right downtown, close to the government buildings and shopping district. Before our first visit (summer 2010) we were very concerned that the rooms would be noisy. My wife is a very light sleeper/shift worker and the last thing in the world we wanted was for our stay to result in her being tired (and grumpy) the next day. We were pleasantly surprised that, when we closed the windows and drew the curtains, the room was virtually silent. Both of us slept exceptionally well. I'm not sure if the rooms are sound proofed but they certainly seem to be. When we checked-in on our most recent visit (March 2011) the Front Desk Manager remembered us and thanked my wife and me for coming back. He seemed genuinely happy to see us and we chatted for 5 minutes or so about our plans for the weekend. If you decide to stay at the CP then I 100% recommend asking to speak with ""Chris"" to get ideas on what to do in Victoria, he clearly loves the city and his enthusiasm is infectious. For people that that are looking for a comparable I would put the level of service at the CP on-par with the Four Seasons in Vancouver, BC (circa spring 2011) and the cleanliness of the rooms at the same level as the Kauai Hilton (circa fall 2007). We feel that the CP is excellent value. There is probably a less expensive hotel further out, but the central location, super clean rooms, quiet sleep environment and most importantly the friendly and attentive approach of the staff make staying here again a no brainer."
POSITIVE,"A budget priced place to stay near Seatac if you need it- otherwise, don't bother. The shuttle service is excellent though and the staff was really friendly and helpful."
POSITIVE,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a cheap mini-vacation to Virginia for about five days/four nights. We were looking for a place that was a little nicer than your average motel, and I have to say we got that and more at such a great rate withBest Western. I read reviews and was only really concerned about the temperature of the room, but once we got there it was quite obvious there were no problems with the air conditioning. The climate and atmosphere were so comfortable I slept better than I have in ages! All in all, my experience was great. The staff was friendly, the breakfast was fresh and filling daily, the room was spacious and cozy (and came stocked with a microwave and refrigerator which was quite helpful!), and the location was extremely convenient. Name any restaurant or fast food joint, and it can be found within two miles of Best Western Historic Area Inn. I will certainly be staying at this hotel upon my next trip to Virginia. My boyfriend and I are truly grateful for the amazing hospitality!"
NEGATIVE,"Hotel had holes in bed spread, nobs missing from drawers, lots of light comes into room from under front door at night, Next to hwy and so loud you can not sleep, tv was way out of date. Would never stay here again."
POSITIVE,"Super clean! Beautiful rooms. Guest services was kind and helpful.we were tapped out from driving 11hours and they stayed on the phone with directions til we got there safely! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location"
NEUTRAL,"Room had a smoky smell. The TV remote did not work, the refrigerator did not work, the A/C did not work. The staff was helpful in correcting issues but there were many issues. I would not stay there again. Pros: Friendly and helpful staff. Cons: Smell of the room (smoky)."
POSITIVE,"Excellent breakfasts, very comfy bed, nice tv, great wi-fi, great price, nice pool, free paper every day, very clean."
NEUTRAL,"Room was clean, bed good. It was a bed to break up a long drive. Nothing more,nothing less."
POSITIVE,"All hotel staff was very helpful. Front desk, polite and timely both check in and out. Staff at PJs (on site b-fast, pub, restaurant) were a real delight. Free b-fast was surprisingly good and the happy hour function welcoming. Staff at PJs are super friendly and made for a very pleasant atmosphere after a long day at work. Exiting the hotel was theÂ only downfall. If you're heading south, it's fine. If your heading north it's a bit tricky."
POSITIVE,the place was very clean. the front desk people are very cortious and helpful. several fast food options around the hotel. perfect place to stay and very afforadable.
POSITIVE,They room was great and the location was good the hot breakfast was not good
POSITIVE,"Hotel was convenient, excellent location. Breakfast was exceptional! This hotel has everything except an indoor pool. We will be back!"
POSITIVE,PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT! BEST HOTEL EVER! I have been going since I was a few weeks old and I am now taking my two children! Recreating the beautiful memories I had as a child!
POSITIVE,"its really nice good service, big swimming pools that we enjoyed in really hot days the room was really clean nice and big room with a lot of space !"
NEUTRAL,"The hotel is fine, nothing special but clean and comfortable. The receptionist was great. But they market this as having a ""water park"" and even give you armbands for it. The water park is a modest pool, hot tub, and one story plastic slide with,I think one 360. It is a nice addition to a regular motel, but I can just imagine the crestfallen faces of kids and their parents to book this hotel expecting a water park."
POSITIVE,The Best Western Palm Desert is clean and well kept. The made to order breakfast is great to have in the morning. The grounds are clean and it is good to have free wifi. The gym needs some sprucing up though. I got a great deal on expedia and the price cannot be beat! Pros: Great made to order breakfast in the morning Cons: The walls are a bit thin Location: Wonderful location on Hwy 111 in Palm Desert
POSITIVE,"Hotel is on the main highway and very convenient. Room was clean and comfortable. We stayed in a conventional room (not a ""theme room"") which is a bit dated furnishing wise, but reasonable for the rate charged. The breakfast buffet was excellent."
POSITIVE,"The resort was awsome, very clean. Their complementary breakfast was great."
POSITIVE,Great room we had an efficiency ocean front room on the 6th floor. It was close to restaurants with one right across the street and several within walking distance. The hotel is just 4 miles from the boardwalk in Daytona. When we left for breakfast in the mornings the room was cleaned by the time we returned.
NEUTRAL,"I won't stay here again. I asked for a quiet room and they put me away from service doors and elevators. That was all good. At 6am, I was awoken to sounds of commercial forklifts. Through the window, I saw the forklifts operating in the dark with their spotlights on, busy loading coils of wire into trucks. All less than 100 ft from my room. The noise was greater than the fan I had on for white noise. Needless to say, I didn't sleep much more than that. I recommend the BW Alderwood 10 miles away, less expensive and reliably quiet if you ask for it. If you stay here, ask to be on the opposite side of the forklifts! Disliked: Location"
POSITIVE,"My best girlfiend and I were at the Best western Fallsview for 6 days. We found it very comfortable especially the bed. It was nice to have 4 pillows. Room #461 was directly across from the Skylon tower. Loved the balcony it was big, chairs were comfortable. People were complaining about the carpet on the walls well it made it sound proof for one thing and it also made it look very clean it was an off white colour. Staff were pleasant ladies that cleaned our room were friendly asking on several occasions if we needed anything. I would stay there again in a heart beat. Safety was not an issue there was always security guys walking around in the parking lot and in the building. Room Tip: higher level facing tower #461 was very nice"
POSITIVE,"Prima locatie. Moderne, ruime kamers. Prima ingericht, netjes en schoon."
POSITIVE,"First time we stayed here and we can't wait to return. Location, price, amenities were all very impressive. Staff was very accommodating. Restaurant was second-to-none. Delicious food at the breakfast. LOVED the fact that it's pet friendly. Beds were extremely comfortable. Easy off, easy on to Interstate. Grounds were well maintained. Thoroughly enjoyed our one-night stay but we'll keep coming back."
NEGATIVE,very disappointed in our stay. We travel quite often and have never been over charged for anything. Here they decided to tack on an additional 250.00 charge for smoking in room we did not smoke in. Customer service is horrible. No return emails or calls...go figure. They only want your money. We will never support a Best Western again. Disliked: Rooms
POSITIVE,"After a nine hour drive, it was a great relief to get here and be welcomed by friendly staff. The room was spacious and the bed so comfortable. Parking was free and everything downtown was a short walk. Hard to find better value. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay."
POSITIVE,"Visited family . We went to Spa Resort Casino, did some gambling and ate at the Buffet. Food was great and reasonable. Also visited Joshua Tree National Park. Saw some rock climbers for entertainment. Beautiful views for the first half of the drive. Second half is rather boring. The room we had at this hotel was great. Had a sitting area along with the normal beds in the room. Pool area was where the breakfast is served. Nice location and a great view by the pool."
POSITIVE,My wife and I were planning to go to Charleston and needed a place to stay. This hotel is extremely close to the bridge to Charleston so getting in and out of the city is easy and the cost difference is quite noticeable between this hotel and the ones in Charleston proper. I don't know about the traffic during tourist season but we didn't have any problems at all. The hotel is clean and the free continental breakfast is more than adequate. The hotel is a little difficult to find the first time but since we bring along our trusty GPS we didn't have any major issues. The hotel is within walking distance of Patriots Point and is a very reasonable choice to stay at if you're out all day exploring the area.
NEGATIVE,"We had a bad experience here. When we walked in the room, nothing was clean. The towels were used and dirty. The bed wasn't made and there was hair on the pillows. Disliked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,I used for stay one night to do a cruise in sunday. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Quiet near to shopping
POSITIVE,GREAT LOCATION TO ALL SURROUNDING AREAS......MANY ATTRACTIONS NEARBY.....GREAT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS.
NEGATIVE,"THE NIGHT MANAGER IS THE MOST RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL PERSON I HAVE EVER MET! The hotel is a very nice place to stay as far as the property but the management has got to go.., at least the one that attacked me with his words! I have a witness to this incident so there is no refuting my claim. A professional person would have at least approached me and my guest in a much nicer way and not attacked us in very rude and ugly words! Sorry for the bad review but something has got to be done! Room Tip: Make sure you. Confirm your plans."
POSITIVE,"After looking through hotel choices for a few days, my friends and I decided that Sea Bay would be the place to stay for Memorial Day Weekend. Price was our main factor, but so was location. Since it is on 60th street, we were a block away from Fager's Island and 12 streets down from Seacrets, which isn't a bad walk at all. There are a lot of rundown old places to stay in Ocean City. This hotel is not one of them. You can't always tell when you look online for Ocean City hotels if it's going to be a good one or not unless you've already been there or if you've heard about it from someone else. Trust me, this is a good one. I've stayed at a lot of places in Ocean City and this has to be the nicest one (unless you really want to shell out the big bucks, but for the majority of OC hotels, this is nice). It looks like it was recently renovated. The lobby area was nicely decorated and the receptionists were all very friendly. One complaint is that we had a room for six people and we were only allowed one parking pass even though we had two cars. The hotel has two buildings: one with the lobby on the main floor and one with rooms only. We were in the building with rooms only which was nice because we didn't have to go through the lobby every time we came in and it was easy to bring guests with us. We got a room for six people and we had two double beds and a sofa bed. It was nice and big and not crowded at all. The bathroom was clean and filled with towels. We had a balcony with two chairs with a bayside view and the pool was below us. Since it was a holiday weekend, the place was packed and at night most people were out on their balconies drinking and being loud. This was fine with us because we were all up, too. Once we were ready to go to bed, we closed the balcony door and couldn't hear any outside noise. The room was great, nice, and clean and the staff was friendly. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."
POSITIVE,My husband I will be checking out tomorrow (Oct. 05) after a 4 night stay. We have done a fair bit of traveling and have stayed in many hotels; this hotel is definitely hands down one of the best for customer service. Any staff that we dealt with were great. Great hotel in a great location; just a short walk to Market and King Streets. There are also lots of great places to eat close by.
POSITIVE,The staff were most accomodating from the moment we checked in. Rennovations on the exterior of the building removed our site lines.
POSITIVE,"I liked everything about this hotel. First of all, the town of Lone Pine is incredible. Lots of cowboy atmosphere ;-) and a stunning view. The hotel staff was very nice, helpfull, interested and funny. The breakfast was by far the best we had in all our California trip. The room was huge, clean, modern and peacefully quiet. It would definitely go there again."
NEGATIVE,New hotel - comfortable beds - walls paper thin though - very noisy
NEGATIVE,"If I could give negative stars I would. I booked this hotel for a one night stay on our way to Greer. I booked using priceline and got the hotel for $60.00. The advertised price was $64.95. Upon booking I called to make my request for a non smoking two bed type. While I understand there are no guarantees when you use priceline, I've NEVER had an issue as long as there was availability. The woman I spoke to kept telling me that I booked my reservation for a smoking king room and I would have to pay 10 dollars extra in order to get a non smoking room because the rates for non smoking queen rooms were higher. This was lie number 1. I reluctantly agreed because I had two children under the age of 5 and was NOT going to subject them to a smoking room. After I hung up the phone, I checked the website. The room I was requesting was the cheapest rate they had and cheaper than the room they were going to give me. So I called back and again tried to find out why they were charging me MORE than their advertised rate for the cheapest room. She decided to call her manager. She then called back and said there was nothing they could do and that I would have to take it up with priceline if I wanted to change the room. I informed her I couldn't because it was a name your own price rate and she stated she'd have the manager call me back but that they were not going to change the room type. I asked her if the problem was that the hotel was full because that I could understand. She told me yes the hotel was completely booked. Lie #2. The manager never called me. I checked Priceline's policy about non smoking and it states that the request is ALWAYS made for non smoking and was based on hotel availibility. Upon our arrival at 10:30pm, we counted 15 cars in the parking lot in a hotel with 43 rooms. I was told my reservation was for the 1 king smoking and I again requested a non smoking room. At this point I didn't care whether there was 1 bed or 2 I just didn't want my children in a smoking room. She asked if I wanted one bed or two. Of course I asked for 2 and she told me it was going to be an additional fee. She didn't see where I had prepaid for the room so she got the manager. At this point I began to discuss the ridiculousness of making me pay an ""upgrade"" fee for a room that was technically a downgrade according to their own site. He started talking about how he could be fined by priceline if he changed my room. A lie...I've had upgrades in hotels almost EVERY time I've booked through priceline. He pulled out a piece of paper that had a priceline logo on it, told me he coudln't show me part of it and covered it with his hand. (in my personal opinion, I bet this showed a request for non smoking) He showed me a line that said something about changes in the reservation such as date etc needed to be made with priceline. The verbage said nothing about bed type. He then told me that I needed to understand things from his point of view. Priceline was taking a commission from my hotel rate. Well I understand that, but I didn't force the hotel to agree to use priceline. I kept telling him that the price for the room I was requesting was LESS than the room he was giving me. He stated that he sets aside a block of rooms for Priceline to sell. I stated that if Priceline's policy is to request non smoking rooms then I think it's pretty terrible that the block set aside is all smoking. He told me that wasn't true. I then asked why I couldn't have one of the non smoking rooms. He again brought up the commission issue. I reluctantly agreed to pay the difference. It was late and I had two children that needed to go to bed. He told me I would just have to pay the difference between what I paid and the current rate. He wanted me to sign a paper that shows the rate I paid was 50 some dollars and that I would have to pay 15.00 for the non smoking room. At which point I informed him the rate I paid was 60.00 a night and that I should only be paying the 6 dollars more for the room. He again brings up the commission that priceline was taking out of my rate. So NOT ONLY was he going to charge me more for a less expensive room, but he was also going to make me pay priceline's commission to him in addition. A room that should have cost me around $70 was not costing me close to $90. I told him I understood that priceline customer's are considered the bottom of the totem pole, but if there was room availability I did not understand why he could not give me a non smoking room for the rate I paid. He stated that he had suites in his hotel and that what I was doing was just like if someone came in off the streets and demanded a suite for the cheapest rate. I told him asking for a non smoking room was hardly demanding a suite. At this point I didn't care anymore about the bed type, I JUST want a non smoking room. He stated he could give me a 1 king non smoking room for ""a little bit cheaper"" At which point I asked him why he would charge me more for the same bed type only non smoking. Again he brought up the commission. At this point I felt like I was beating a dead horse. I made one last comment about the fact that it was terrible that he made priceline customers take smoking rooms simply because they were priceline customers and it was ridiculous he was making me pay more for my room JUST to have non smoking when the hotel was more than 50% empty. He then stated that they tried to accommodate the priceline non smoking request if rooms were available. I said ""There are rooms available!"" and he stated there were only queen rooms available. Yet 5 minutes earlier he stated he could give me a king non smoking for ""a little cheaper."" I had been lied to by his customer service rep at least twice on the phone, and then lied to by the manager. He just gave me the run around. This manager has lost a customer for life. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. He may have gotten his $15.00 priceline commission back, but has lost a multitude of business. We had 3 groups of family members on their way up and we told them to keep on driving to the next town. We had all planned on staying the night we drove back but made the decision to keep on driving. A little customer service and a little less greed by this hotel staff could have earned a whole lot more ""commission"" with our future business. Room Tip: Don't use Priceline."
POSITIVE,"Five ""Gal Pals"" visited Charleston SC for 4 days and couldn't have been happier with the King Charles Inn. Everything was wonderful right down to the warm chocolate chip cookies every evening in the lounge area. The rooms were comfortably appointed and very clean. All of the staff were professional and friendly, very helpful. The location is awesome for walking to most areas of the city. If I returned to Charleston, I'd stay at the King Charles Inn again, no second thoughts."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at the Buttefield while in Hays for a wedding. The hotel is new and nicely decorated. The rooms were larger than I was expected and the beds very comfortable. Free breakfast in the morning was pretty good, especially the biscuits and gravy. We did not use the pool but it looked nice. This is a great little hotel and I would definitely return."
POSITIVE,"Convenient location right off highway 91 at Lincoln. Stayed in room 125, we were pleasantly suprised by the size of the room, larger than average. Bed was comfortable. Liked parking 6 feet from the door. Front desk staff were friendly. Adequately clean. Iron in room. Free internet. Efficient air conditioner unit. However: Parking lot filled up to total capacity, toilet is a small round model, lower seat level that we prefer, looks like a small refrigerator has been deleted from the coffee table area. Still a good overall value, especially at the ""secret"" unpublished rate. Will definitely use this hotel again if needed."
NEUTRAL,Pros: Friendly and helpful staff. Cons: Beds were very uncomfortable.
POSITIVE,"Awesome! Our family of 4 enjoyed our stay in June 2011. This is the best accommodations in Forest Grove and just a short drive(or walk) up to Pacific University. The room was clean and comfortable, beds were very comfy. They had Bath & Body Works bath amenities which was a nice surprise. Refrigerator & microwave made our stay more comfortable, they even offer free newspapers. The staff that we met were all very friendly- we really appreciated the patience of our late check in clerk. We were even late to breakfast on the first morning arriving just 5 minutes before they were supposed to close down- the dining room staff was so gracious. Looking forward to staying again! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"Rooms are a decent size and in good shape. View of river is nice and there's a restuarant on site that's pretty good, not great, just pretty good. Close to a lot of other places if not to your liking. There's a free trolley that picks you up practically out front of the lobby. It will take you just about anywhere you would like to visit in Oregon City. A lot of history there with museums and tours. End of the Oregon Trail Center is nearby and the trolley will take you straight there. We took a ""Walk With the Spirits"" tour that tells you the haunts of Oregon City and some other tales that make up the town. Room Tip: Top floor is always best"
POSITIVE,"This hotel was a good choice - near LAX. We had a room in the back and had no noise. The breakfast was very good with lots of choices including bacon, eggs, and belgian waffles. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was very convenient."
POSITIVE,This hotel was close to where we needed to go. It was clean and the staff was great in helping us with what ever we needed. Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet Cons: printers did not work well
NEUTRAL,"Pros: The pool was wonderful. Cons: Hotel staff were not very friendly, Restraunt food was cold and service was slow."
POSITIVE,I remember when this hotel was built when I lived in Trinidad. It had been well maintained.
POSITIVE,"Clean, nice and friendly staff, reasonable selection for free breakfast. Best of all a jacuzzi tub in room! Room Tip: Not all rooms have the jacuzzi tub - so ask."
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed my stay, was clean, comfortable and the little resturant next door had good food at a great price. Pros: Free Internet Quiet"
POSITIVE,"Great service an rooms, near plenty of shops an resturants Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet"
NEGATIVE,"I was traveling across country with my son who is in the Coast Guard. We wanted to stay in Alexandria as he was being transferred to Washington and he thought he might want to live in Alexandria. When we first got there the person at the front desk was talking schedules with a couple of the hotel maids. They all turned around and looked at us and then turned away....no one even acknowledged us even though we were the only ones in the hotel lobby. When she was finished she asked curtly if she could help us and we told her we had a reservation for 4 nights. It went from bad to worse at that time. She would not accept the credit card that I had been using from California all the way to Virginia because it had my husband's name on it and he wasn't with us. No one else clear across the U.S. had a problem. I fortunately had another credit card with my name on it that she accepted. The room was very expensive and they had no elevators, no bellmen to help with huge luggage and the room was very dirty. The bathroom looked like it was out of a service station....we ended up cancelling the rest or our reservation and staying someplace else."
POSITIVE,"Pony soldier is actually on the old business ""66"", has the plaster pony out front and the neon that remids you of the old ""66"" but behind is a newer moted with a nice contenental breakfast and great rooms. Stay towards the back if you don't like train noise as it is noticable (but not too loud) during the night (there were several trains). Nice pool and hot tub as well to relax in after a day of hiking at the Grand Canyon. Be sure you do not miss Painted Desert and Petrified Forest National Park or Sunset Crater National Monument - plan for a several day stay!"
NEUTRAL,Not really impressive but has all basic ammenities and a good starting point for the nearby Grand Canyon national park
POSITIVE,"I have stayed at this hotel twice since I moved away from TO about a year ago and both times I have been very pleased. The rooms are a very good size and, at least from the ones I have been in, well laid out and clean. The second time I stayed there was a little bit more noise then the time before, but nothing too distracting. I really didn't use many of the amenities, as I really just used the hotel as a base for my time in TO. I previously lived in the area of the hotel (Yonge and Eglinton) and being honest, this area is an awesome place to visit/live. From the hotel, the subway at Eglinton station (trip from this station to downtown is about 10 mins) is about 4 blocks west and at the Yonge-Eglinton corner there is a small mall. Also, the area has alot of great places to eat, especially along Yonge St. Bringing this all together, you get a very good hotel in an excellent area. I found the rates very reasonable and the staff very friendly and would definately recommend this hotel."
POSITIVE,This hotel is a very quiet and nice. The setting is in the mountain area of Pollock Pines. It is very easy to find just off of Route 50. The hotel is far enough away from the interstate that the road noise is not a problem. The hotel has 24 rooms with 12 upstairs and 12 down. There is no elevator so if you need one you need to reserve a ground level room. The room was large and clean. They have a microwave and refrigerator. The refrigerator was quiet and I never heard it during the night. The breakfast is on the 2nd floor above the office. The offering was adequate but would be boring if I had to eat here several days in a row. There are several restaurants in the area if needed. We extended our stay an extra day as we decided to this was such as nice area. We plan to come back next year and will stay here again. The only problem we had was lack of cell phone signal in this immediate area. This of course was not a hotel issue. The hotel does have free wifi with a strong signal strength.
NEUTRAL,Great location next to airport. Bathtub drain clogged. Short in light by bed - sparks! Door to adjacent room was bare wood - no paint. Air conditioner is under window and very noisy. Would not serve anyone over 18 in Cafe without parent after 8 pm. Won't go back.
NEGATIVE,"The Reno Ski Club was treated poorly at the Terminal Way hotel. We're a good group of people and tend to eat and enjoy food at whatever facility we use. I work at a large business in Carson City. We've used the Airport Plaza Hotel for our customers and guests. Given that customer service is no longer a priority at this particular hotel, I'll discourage using it in the future. It is unfortunate because it had provided good service in the past."
POSITIVE,Very clean and friendly staff - enjoyed the great pool and hot tub. Needed a microwave in the room!
NEUTRAL,"We were booked for two nights however our Grand Canyon tour was cancelled due to weather so we checked out early and drove to Page, AZ. The front desk person was helpful and arranged for us to stay at a Best Western in Page, AZ. When I returned home I noticed my credit card was charged an additional night. I called the hotel and was passed around a few times. They called me back and said we did not check out at the front desk so they thought we stayed the additional night. I advised that we did check out with the front desk and the girl even helped us book a reservation at another Best Western. They said no problem, they refunded me the room charge. 4 weeks after our stay in Grand Canyon I noticed another night charged on my credit card (We stayed there March 5 and this charge was for March 16). I had to call again and go through the same process. They said they will refund my credit card and they don't know why I was charged again. NOTE: CHECK YOUR STATEMENT UPON YOUR RETURN. With that being said: This hotel is really close to the south rim entrance of the Grand Canyon. The rooms were nice; big rooms. Very spacious. We ate dinner at the restaurant, not great. A little pricy, a little bit to ""fine dining"". Had we stayed longer we would not have returned to that restaurant. The hotel stay was good and the room rate was reasonable. Room Tip: Check your credit statements upon your return."
POSITIVE,Excellent value for visiting universal tough to beat the computer business room was bad not hooked to printer
NEGATIVE,If you are going to Legoland you can't beat the location. They have a really nice pool as well. The rooms are clean but the entire place is OLD and poorly laid out. They charge a fortune for breakfast which you can get for FREE at other Best Western hotels. I would not return. Staff is not helpful. Room Tip: At least ask for a room with a doorway towards the pool.
POSITIVE,"Close to new grand baby:) Easy access from freeway, clean, affordable rooms, nice hot breakfast included. Have stayed twice now, will prob be back before long!"
POSITIVE,"great location, staff extremely friendly"
POSITIVE,"Great location and accomodations. Beds were super comfortable. Breakfast was way more than expected for a complementary breakfast. Most hotels offer dry cereal, coffee and donuts. Here, hot breakfast made to order as well as pastries, fruit, and oatmeal. Would definitely stay here again!"
POSITIVE,"Stayed here for 1 night returning from a vacation. The staff at checkin and out were wonderful, could not have been more accomodating or efficient!The room was nicely appointed with everything we needed. The room was reasonably quiet,but there was some noise in the hallways which is understandable since it was on a weekend during ski season! The room was very clean as was all aspects of the property. We would recommend this property to anyone."
NEGATIVE,"Toilet made loud noise, tv was static, large group function took up the entire pool and courtyard surroundings. Very disappointed. Room was clean and staff was friendly."
POSITIVE,The size of the TV and the water provided in the lobby the pillows and towels
POSITIVE,"We just got back from a 2 week trip out west. I think that this was one of my favorite hotels of all of them! We were in the main building, upstairs. We had an elevator, but the stairs were not steep, so that's what we used. Nice garden tub. Kreuig coffe maker, clean, comfy beds. The breakfast was at their restaraunt, so it was a full breakfast bar- very yummy! Downstairs there was a six lane bowling alley and a small gameroom. Very close to the South Rim entrance. Not many other restaraunts around- McD, Burger King, a pizza place. McD's was much higher than Nashville area prices, so we opted for the pizza place and ended up spending even more!!! Room Tip: I see some saying that they weren't in the main building and that it wasn't nice. I do remem..."
NEUTRAL,"The room was ok, but not great. Especially for the price we paid. It's pretty far from downtown so you can't really walk to any of the bars or restaurant. Breakfast is included, and is your standard continental breakfast fare. The bed was very firm, towels were scratchy, and our bathroom had the faint scent of urine. At least the whirlpool tub was a nice touch."
POSITIVE,"This is an excellent hotel choice for the Grand Canyon. During the season there is a free shuttle bus to canyon visitor centre. It is only seven miles and 10 minutes by car (which we had to do in late September.) The free shuttle bus along the rim however runs all year round restaurant is excellent, European style cooking and portions (not USA size!) Great wine list. You will need to book early in restaurant or face eating about 9pm. Don't be put off if you are told there will be half an hour delay....... for three successive nights they sat us down within 10 or 15 minutes.Rooms are excellent throughout the hotel (we were in block 3)"
POSITIVE,"after driving around eureka, we finally decided on this hotel. We are very happy that we did. Loved the room and all the amenities from the large lcd tv to the upgraded shampoo and conditioner. Even though it is located between two busy streets, it takes up a large area. we asked fo a room near the center and didn't hear any road noise for the 2 nights we stayed. it is located within walking distance (5 blocks) to their historic old town and marina/boardwalk. Great antique shops and eateries. the limo service was great and all staff that we encountered were friendly. we will be back! Room Tip: ask for a room near the center of property"
POSITIVE,"This was our last stay on a 10 day vacation and was by far the hotel with the most. Very friendly service, spotlessly clean rooms and fabulous breakfast. There was a little problem with the pool key/lock but it didn't hinder our enjoyment of the pool. Our only complaint was that there was no hot water and coffee in the lobby later in the evening whichÂ was not that big of a deal as we had the small pot in our room."
NEUTRAL,Heater not working properly. No complimentary breakfast no slippers available. Pros: Room Location: Accessible
POSITIVE,"Excellent staff! They were always very friendly and helpful! The rooms were very clean and there was a great breakfast included with the stay. We enjoyed it so much, we stayed there an extra 2 nights at the end of our trip. Pros: Free airport shuttle,complimentary breakfast and great staff"
POSITIVE,"Location and value for the money were good. Continental breakfast selections were terrific. Shuttle service was much-appreciated. Swimming pool hours didn't suit our sightseeing schedule; would have been nice to have it open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. A/C was especially loud. Also, in our room, a fan from an old switch had to continously run in order to have power to the bathroom and outer vanity lighting. This was quite annoying."
POSITIVE,We stayed at this motel during the Fantasy Fest celebration for 4th time. They have been nice to us in the office and the rates are reasonable for that time of year. The pool is great. The rooms and breakfast are very nice. It has always been quiet for sleeping and plenty of parking. I would recommend this place to anyone and looking forward to going back this next Oct.
POSITIVE,"It has a shuttle bus to the Pentagon Shopping Mall where you can get on a tour bus or a metro so you don't have to find parking and drive in dc. I didn't like the fact that is was under construction, so it was dirty and noisy on the outside. The air conditioner in our room was also very noisy. If you are looking for something cheap and close to dc and not a ritzy place it was fine. Also my kids were unhappy that they closed the pool early so they did not get to unwind with swimming after a long day of sight seeing."
POSITIVE,"Nice hotel will be staying there again next year. Even though hotel is on busy road, slept like a baby, because you could not hear traffic noise. Liked everything about the hotel."
POSITIVE,Good! Parking
POSITIVE,"We got our room at a REALLY low unpublished rate. It was a great bargain. I was worried about the quality with the price, but the rooms were clean keeping up with the Best Wester brand. The bathroom was small, but overall it was a great deal. Pros: Quiet. Cons: Small bathroom Location: Close to restaurants, mall and shopping."
NEGATIVE,"Beat up rooms. Noisy. Outside corridor filled with rowdy people who were arrested in middle of night. Only good thing was friendly staff. Don't risk it! Liked: Service, Location Disliked: Rooms"
POSITIVE,"We had a two day one night visit to the Grand Canyon and spent the night at Best Western in Tusayan. The hotel is configured as a series of separate blocks, all within easy walk, but don't unload the car until you know where your room will be. An excellent large well appointed room (including two folding supports for the cases). We had a faulty a bath plug but the problem was resolved quickly and pleasantly full marks for the maintenance team! The included buffet breakfast, taken in the main building, was on of the better we came across on this holiday and the 'room' and buffet bar were large enough to accommodate the coach party that chose the same time to eat. All in all a pleasant overnight stay. We were recommended to eat at the Yipee-ei-o steakhouse and it was all that we could hope for, however it gets very busy so go early (18:15 just beat the rush). Room Tip: Try for the ground floor"
POSITIVE,The hotel is brand new and the staff was very friedly and accomodating. The hotel was very close to a variety of food options and right off the interstate.
POSITIVE,"I've stayed in this hotel 5 or 6 times. This last time, I was disappointed with the bathroom ""amenities"", specifically the towels. They seemed like a dog drag them around and tear them, then the cleaning ladies used them to mop the floors, clean the rooftops, let them hanging to dry, and then reuse them as regular towels."
NEUTRAL,"The staff at the counter was nice. The hotel in general is old needs a face lift. The Elevator seen some years, It shacks and makes grinding noises. It need some inspection very soon. The bathroom tubs are whirlpool the water ports have green rust stains. The rooms need updating. I will never stay hear again I should have walked away. I paid for itÂ online, I wish I looked at some reviews of this place. stupid me!!!!!"
NEUTRAL,Good for handiness to airport....very basic.
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in June. It was a good hotel. It takes only several minutes to the tube station (Earls Court). It is located in a quite street with other small hotels. My room was on the top floor. It's small but clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was helpful and friendly. Plus, there was free wi-fi in our hotel room, which was very important to us! Breakfast is also good, with a reasonable number of choices."
POSITIVE,"Went to a wedding and was very pleased with the hotel. After reading the negative reviews whilst getting directions off Google I was apprehensive about attending and staying overnight in this hotel, however I was pleased to find the negative reviews inaccurate! The setting was lovely and the furnishings within were of a good standard and in a great state of repair. The food was lovely and very well presented. The room in which the reception was held was lovely with a good sized dance floor. The Master of Ceremonies was funny and kept the function going at a good pace. The only negative I could find was that the pressure from the shower wasn't the greatest. All in all I enjoyed the function and my stay at The Garfield House Hotel..."
NEGATIVE,We chose this Hotel over The Grand Hotel in Tusayan to indulge ourselves in more luxury and paid extra for oversized room based on the picture presented at the website. However the room we got (room # 1104) was really small and looked even smaller than the traditional king size room in this hotel. When we asked at the front desk we were told that this was the oversized room we had reserved. We feel there's a huge discrepancy between the rooms presented at the reservation website and the actual room assigned at the arrival. As a member of BW RewardsÂ® Program I have stayed at many BW hotels and this is the first time we are disappointed we chose Best Western over another hotel. If the hotel presents more accurate information it will benefit future guests. Room Tip: be careful when you select the room in this hote
POSITIVE,"I only have one complaint... the mattresses were really too soft, but otherwise, it was perfect. I would definitely stay there again."
POSITIVE,Visiting Disneyland for the day with the family. We found the hotel to be delightfully furnished. The guestrooms were exceptionally clean. The beds were so comfortable and the rooms so quite it was hard to get up and going in the morning. Enjoyed visiting with the front desk staff the night of arrival. He was cheerful and accommodating. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in a beautiful morning room. Breakfast was a little light on the offering but ample and delicious. Especially the blueberry make-your-own waffles! Great business center in the lobby. The women enjoyed the exercise room in the morning! Why exercise before Disneyland I will never know? We would highly recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,This is the second. Time we have. Stayed in this hotel. This time we brought our whole family. We went for our daughter second birthday to seaworld. Its really close to anywhere you want to go especially seaworld. They let us decorate our hotel room completley for her birthday and they stored our cake in the hotel fridge. Every staff member is so niceÂ and sweet. There are two resturants right across the street that are great too. The one little problem is The Occassional airplane You hear becuase its close to the airport. Everyroom has a balcony which is nice! I will definitly stay here again!
POSITIVE,"This hotel is in a great location in the historic district of Charleston and if you love walking then it is within distance of all the sites. Get the walking map and go exploring. The stop for the DASH free bus is opposite the hotel also so if you are tired by the end of the day or it is raining then you can hop on the one that takes you past this route. The hotel has recently been refurbished and has been beautifully done. I would consider it a small boutique hotel as it only has about 90 rooms so doesn't feel crowded (although I was there in the off season - winter). There is a really nice lounge/bar area that overlooks the pool which is great for relaxing, catching up with other guests or meeting people at the happy hour. There is also a restaurant that is only open for breakfast but cannot comment on this as I took my own cereal with me. The fridge in your room does not have a mini bar in it so can be totally utilised for your own food and drinks. There are also a couple of computers off the lounge area which have free internet use and printers which are great for checking emails, checking out some of the sites and finding maps. Don't be concerned that there isn't a restaurant in the hotel that is open for dinner as there are heaps of restaurants in the area that you can try out and the hotel can help you with any questions or just go exploring. I didn't have a problem walking around the area on my own during the day or in the early evening."
POSITIVE,"Warm, comfortable beds, nice room with desk, couch and coffee table. Excellent breakfast with really good selection of fresh fruit. Front desk very helpful with finding local restaurants. Would certainly stay there again if passing through at the right time of day. The best BW I have stayed in."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here June 24-26, and chose the location because it was right in Norwalk for the NHRA dragraces going on that weekend. We went to the races on the Sunday, but went to Cedar Point on the Saturday, and the motel was only about a half hour away, which worked out well. I think (but am not sure) that the Hotwire rate we got of $64/nt was probably pretty reasonable compared with what some of the Sandusky motels would have charged (because they're so much closer to Cedar Point). Reception was very friendly, the hotel and room was clean ... we had 2 Queens, each with 4 awesome fluffy pillows (I wanted to take them home they were so comfortable - but didn't, honest!!) The continental breakfast was very adequate, pretty good selection of things. We didn't use the pool, we just needed a place to rest our heads in between our 2 days of activities, and this place fit the bill. There were quite a few chain fast food places nearby, as well as a Bob Evans just across the road. We'd definitely stay here again if we found ourselves going to the dragraces and/or Cedar Point again. Oh, and free in-room WiFi was a nice feature, although it wasn't a secure network, so I wouldn't be using it to do your online banking or anything ..."
NEGATIVE,I booked the hotel thinking the price they told me was the price I would pay. I get there and its $10 for every vehicle to park in their lot. Really?
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently. The location was very convenient to downtown (about a mile). I believe they have some kind of a shuttle, but we never looked into it. The view from the terrace is very nice and there are several tables and chairs set out to enjoy a sunrise or sunset from. We had one slight issue while at the hotel. We came and checked in, but were in a rush to make a tour, so we just took our keys and never unpacked the car until we got back at about 9pm. When we went to go to our room, someone was in it. I guess the hotel made some kind of a mistake and checked both them and us into the same room. They were very apologetic and upgraded us to a fireplace room. Otherwise, everything was nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful, there was a complementary breakfast, and the room was clean (could probably use some new sheets, though). While in Sedona, we did the Pink Jeep Tour. The hotel has some kind of a booking package where you can get a tour and room, but it wasn't available when we were there. However, Pink Jeep told me that the hotel concierge would probably have a 10% off coupon for the tour (and they did), so that saved us some money. Also, I HIGHLY recommend the Pink Jeep's 2 hour Broken Arrow Tour. We loved it."
POSITIVE,Rooms were nice and they truly were nonsmoking. We were in Blackfoot for the fair and the location was great. Room Tip: ask for the best price for rooms.
POSITIVE,"Our intentions were to enjoy a quick ""get-a-way"" inexpensively. The BW offered clean, neat rooms and provided the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in at a hotel/motel. The only issues were that the toilet didn't flush well, and the air conditioner smelled like cat urine at times, although the party we traveled with didn't have either problem in their room. The highlight, which actually prompted us to stay here was the free hot, full continental breakfast offered. Excellent! The pool area was not fancy but adequate, plus, we were there for the beach mostly. For a location off the beach, access to the beach and nightlife was definitely do-able. There was no ocean view as other hotels are built around this 5-story BW. Definitely ask for a poolside view with a deck. Unless you plan to go sight-seeing, a car was not needed. I would return to this BW for another short-stay, as it was very affordable."
POSITIVE,"We had an overnight stop in Calgaryon on our flight home from Mexico. We found a tastefully decorated, large comfortable room. An excellent breakfast was included. It was close to the airport with prompt free shuttle. When we told them we were on a later flight they allowed us to stay 2 hours past the checkout time with no charge. I would stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"Everything was entirely acceptable about the motel (sorry- it is not a hotel) except the low-life that it's low rates have attracted. The low-llife smokers are prohibited from smoking in the room, so they drag a chair outside and breathe the smoke into everyone else's air-conditioner intake. While they are at it, they make long, extended cell phone calls that all of us must listen to. It is just jabber that we don't want to listen to. The low-life families bring their screaming children and let them run loose until they finally get tired and expect everyone to enjoy listening to it. The low-life drinkers go out on-the-town (bar-hopping?) until about 10pm and then they come back and tell us all about it in very loud voices OUTSIDE their room. The low-life inconsiderates take pride in how many times they can slam the motel room door in one day. Is there a penalty for closing it gently. It is very sad that such nice staff have to work around such low-life."
POSITIVE,Convenient airport shuttle. Friendly front desk staff. Children enjoy the swimming pool. The hot tub can't use before am 8:30.
NEUTRAL,The carpet in the room was very dirty but everything else worked well for me. They did have a nice breakfast also.
POSITIVE,"This is the third year we have stayed at Best Western of Birch Run during our back to school shopping trip. Very reasonable rates: on a weekday it's only $89US for a room that accomodates our family of 6 in a queen and 4 bunks. While the bunk mattresses are not luxurious, this is a perfect arrangment when travelling with a large family. It looked like the pool area had been upgraded this year. Swimming until 10pm for the kids, then an hour for just adults `til 11pm. Kids loved the arcade games and pool table. Great pizza in the bar/breakfast area + a free drink at happy hour. The bartender and front desk staff were very obliging. Breakfast included waffles with fruit and whipped cream, cereal, juice, milk, yogurt and breads. Not fancy but lots! Internet accesss in the lobby. Excellent shopping at the factory outlet mall. Close to picturesque Frankenmuth and the great chicken dinners there!"
POSITIVE,We really loved the price as we managed to have a lovely stay booking on line and getting a great deal on price. We found the room and service to be top of the line and very comfortable. The continental breakfast was complimentary and the selection was varied with many foods to choose from. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that we could here our neighbors conversations in the hall quite clearly and although not clearly we could here them talking in their room beside us.
POSITIVE,"This hotel is definitely worth a return trip. Clean, comfortable, good breakfast, 2 for 1 drink coupons. It was within 15-30 minutes of where we wanted to go in Dallas."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel is located right next door to Legoland, very convenient for our trip there. The room was decent and there is plenty of restaurants around it and a Walmart just up the road."
NEUTRAL,Over all not bad. A little out dated but clean. We asked for a king size bed and was told it would be an extra $20 a night. That was just silly! We've spent many nights in hotels and never had to pay extra for a bigger bed. There's no breakfast included but they're in the middle of it all. Not hard to find food. Over all it was a good find.
POSITIVE,"This hotel was clean, the breakfast was good, and everything worked as it should. There was even a nice steakhouse and a gas station next door so we didn't have to travel into a town to eat or get gas. The pillows could've been a bit fluffier. The bed, otherwise, was very comfortable. The walls must be a bit thin because I could hear noise from another room one night."
POSITIVE,"I can not tell you how many times we have stayed at this Best Western, but I'm sure it's amounted to dozens of nights. The rooms are nice and clean, the property is very well kept, the staff is always friendly, and the views are awesome! Not sure what else one would look for, so do not hesitate to stay here. Little tip, we prefer the sunrise side of the property. Anyway, you can't go wrong here. Inn of Sedona staff, see you in March!"
POSITIVE,"Close to hospitals and Rice University. Good value for the location. Apparently, the carpet was not vacuumed as there were toe nail clippings from a prior guest next to the bed which was an unfortunate sight to see. If not for that, the room was very comfortable and and well maintained."
NEGATIVE,We stayed at this location because we wanted to be close to Legoland- that and it's 3 star rating. I think the location gains the hotel that third star. Otherwise- this would be a 2. Our room was totally missed to be made up- my mom had to wrestle with the door to open it- the room was across from a parking lot that we could hear music nightly- bedsÂ were crap- breakfast expensive and bad... But we were near Legoland. Next time well try the holiday inn or Hilton that aren't that much further away.
POSITIVE,We weren't certain whether we would be able to make it to Needles on a particular day of our trip. I had torn out the pages from our AAA tour book for Needles and kept them with me. An hour out of town and using the AAA motel phone listing I called Best Western and reserved a room for the night. We were very satisfied with the room and the courteous service. Room Tip: Choose the street side of the motel. The back side is exposed to the busiest railroad lines in the...
POSITIVE,"Clean, well-maintained, good location. But when you reserve a room at a hotel so your kids can play in the heated pool, it would be nice to actually *have* a heated pool. When we were there (16/17 June 2011) the pool was drained and the entire area was undergoing major renovation. Major bummer when you have kids to keep amused and now you have toÂ go fork out more money to find places for them to play!"
POSITIVE,Pros: Good location for my requirements. Cons: Side entrance appears to be unlocked all night. Should be secured.
POSITIVE,"Staff are very pleasant and try to make your stay enjoyable. Hotel has a ""neat"" feel to it. Complimentary WiFi is very helpful. Breakfast was nice as well. Overall, a very clean and enjoyable hotel. Only negative was the non-smoking room had a distinct smell of smoke - but other than that very nice."
NEUTRAL,"Clean, convenient, and comfortable. Bad area of town at night. You must go to Custom Burger across the street -- excellent burgers and fries!"
NEGATIVE,"Pro: free wifi, free breakfast, free shuttle to metro, and price Con: no controllable thermostat in room & its loud! weekend club in the hotel, rooms nor bathrooms are not to die for, outdated hotel Not a great hotel, or for the family but good for price. Liked: Location Disliked: Service, Rooms"
POSITIVE,"We were visiting Napa for the first time, and we were so pleased with the gracious hotel staff and lovely hotel room. The front desk staff were very welcoming and very helpful in planning our wine tour. Also, the breakfast was very good."
POSITIVE,"The BW was a nice hotel with the right price. I didn't find any hair on my bed or any trash laying around. The area was nice with few shops around and restaurants. In conclusion, the price was good and cleanliness was top notch as well."
POSITIVE,First time staying at a BW+.. very nice & friendly staff.
POSITIVE,We had a short stay and wished we could have stayed longer. The hotel is clean and the room is beautiful. the bed was very comfortable. There was a lovely little balcony to sit on and enjoy the weather. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,"Huge rooms, comfy beds but they need fitted sheets, need flatter pillows. Great price. Great breakfast for the price. Front door needed weatherstripping. I'd stay there again."
NEGATIVE,"We were given a room on on the first floor, which was too noisy even after 11pm. The hotel seemed to be too old as the window panes would start vibrating anytime someone walks in the corridor. The walls/ceiling seemed to be too thin as you could hear the noise of shower, wash basin water tap, someone talking in the neighboring rooms, etc."
NEGATIVE,"Paid $210 for one night and the sink in the room would not drain and the toilet would on flush 1/4th of the contents down. Complained to customer service and received a standard copy & paste ""...sorry for your inconvenience..."" email. This hotel is outdated, over priced and not worth more than $80 a night. I would not stay here again. Liked: Location Disliked: Service"
NEUTRAL,"My stay here was okay. It.is nice and close to the airport. I think I was out the door, through security, and to my gate in about 20 minutes. However, the fact that they charged people residing there a parking fee seemed to me a little ridiculous.I could see issuing a parking pass, but to charge customers to park in their own lot; come on. Bake it into the price of the room if your gonna do that, but nickel and dime your customers. Next time I come to San Francisco, I will probably opt to stay at another hotel that is a little less convenient to the airport to save on the extras. I also found that the was limited options around the hotel for shopping, and dining. Fortunately, I had a car. It took me 15 minutes of sit-sagging through town to get to the closest pharmacy. Bottom line, get online and use a internet map, and figure out what you might need around a hotel before you book it. This was a lesson learned for me."
POSITIVE,"It is a great hotel with an excellent services. Clean rooms, good bed, good badroom, good pillows, nice television, good breakfast, friendly personal. Special thanks to Mr. Antonio, Mrs. Veronica, Mr. Sean, Mr. Sam. Room Tip: I like more the rooms in the second floor."
POSITIVE,"We had a one night stay at this Best Western for a ski weekend. The beds were comfortable, the halls were quiet (couldn't hear people stomping up and down the hall at all hours) and breakfast in the lobby couldn't be beat. The hot tub could have been a little hotter but it was nice and large for our family and friends."
POSITIVE,"We booked this hotel as it had the best deal on price for a hotel that included an indoor pool. We had an excellent stay. The hotel staff was EXTREMELY friendly, nice and helpful. I was impressed with everyone we encountered, especially the front desk staff. The pool area was undergoing some maintenance but was still a lovely swim. We had 2 doubleÂ beds in a nonsmoking room. There was a slight scent of smoke in the room likely from the ventilation system, so people with severe allergies may have a problem). The bathroom was a bit older, and probably could use a reno or refresh soon but it wasn't a big deal. The beds were comfortable, the room was lovely, the lounge area was very pretty. We went to Albany (From Ottawa) to shop, and the location was great. It was less than a 10 minute drive to everywhere we wanted to go (2 malls, Target, Walmart, the restaurant we had a deal at), ample free parking was also great. I would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend it to others."
POSITIVE,"price is reasonable, it's very good location, swimming pool is nice and clean."
POSITIVE,"Staff very friend. Rooms are clean. Hotel offers free DVDs and board games for guest. Great exercise room, and pool area. On Sundays you get a free brunch/breakfast from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm excellent brunch. Pros: Staff friendly, always willing to tell you what they offer without you having to ask. Excellent breakfast on Sundays. Cons: Wish they had Whirlpool."
POSITIVE,"ALL OK, HOTEL CLEAN STAYED THERE NUMEROUS TIMES THIS IS WHY WE RETURNED."
NEGATIVE,"The Worst Hotel I have ever bought through Hotels.com. The room was filthy, The AC was loud and hot, no air conditioning coming out just hot air. The refrig was noisy, bathroom fan was very noisy, no change of bath towels during the stay. We had to go down to the front desk and get enough towels & wash cloths for the weekend and the floors were neverÂ vacuumed.. Our over all stay was the worst I have ever stayed in a Best Western Hotel across the US."
POSITIVE,"We were very pleased with everything on this trip. Give it 5 stars all around. But, came back for overnight on Sept. 3. Room was not the same quality as first stay. Would consider staying again, but ask about room quality. Shuttle service was great to & from airport. Breakfast was hot & cold food., Walk to other restaurants. Good neighborhood. kid Â friendly"
POSITIVE,"The staff was friendly and accomodating. Rooms were clean and spacious. Not high end finishes, but the price was definately right. Easy in/out. Breakfast was fresh, dining area clean."
NEGATIVE,"The hotel gave us a room with a pull out couch instead of the double bed room we requested. The staff seemed not to care that this was an inconvenience to us. The hotel room also had a plastic skylight; so every time it rained, we heard every drop fall. There was no way to sleep or get comfortable in the room. The hotel ran out of towels so we wereÂ forced to go buy our own. And once again, the staff didn't seemed concerned with this error. This was a very nice hotel for its location, but I would not recommend anyone stay here if you are anyway concerned with towels, sleeping and a friendly staff."
POSITIVE,"We were upgraded to a different room which was awesome to have. The hotel looks like it is being upgraded and I thought it was just perfect for going to Legoland. We ate the breakfast one day but it seemed that it was a little understaffed so we ate across the street at Perkins. If I could give one suggestion it would be to heat the pool. The pool is in a great location and very large. We would have gotten in even though Florida was having a cold snap, but the water was freezing. It looks like they are building an outside bar/restaurant near the pool. The hotel is an older hotel but the location to Legoland and really everything you may need is perfect, not walkable but very convenient! Pros: location to Legoland Cons: small bathroom Location: awesome and close to Legoland"
POSITIVE,"I enjoyed my stay. I had two children with me, so the pool was a great option. Decent breakfast, good housecleaning service, reasonable rates."
POSITIVE,"We stayed at this location for 1 night. I was a little skeptical of a Best Western, but we figured for one night we could make anything work. I'm glad we took a chance and booked here. The two gentlemen at the front desk were very nice and helpful - they even had samples of Tom's of Maine toothpast :) . The room was clean, quiet, and everything was in working order. The free wifi was in working order and we had no problems with it. The complimentary breakfast was much better than average. There was the usual variety of muffins, breads, cereals and the like. They also had waffles, buscuits and gravy, sausage, and crepes. This was a very nice surprise! The owner was around in the during breakfast keeping the area clean and stocked - again a nice surprise! He took the time to visit with me and make sure our stay was enjoyable. The only downside I can think of is the lack of a pool. There is a hot tub that is entered from outside. This is a ski community so I understand that most people staying with likely be too busy to use a pool. We were too busy checking out the wildlife and cute little town to pay much attention to the lack of a pool. We would definitely stay here again!"
POSITIVE,"Im not sure what kind of mamby pambys write these atrocious reviews ! perhaps they are accostomed to 300 dollar a night suites ? This place is PERFECT for the budget minded. Nice room ( its really a suite) No bedbugs..nice folks by the pool and neat and clean. Don't let the negative reviews scare you..I paid 35 cash on a sunday night, 1.50 margaritas at the bar too !! Liked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value"
POSITIVE,"Just spent 3 nights at the hotel and as usual..a great stay. The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly, pool is clean and breakfast is ample."
POSITIVE,I enjoyed this hotel experience because it was clean and the rooms were welcoming. There is close access to the freeway but far enough that the noise of traffic wasn't disturbing.Pros: I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the hotel and the freshness of the room. Cons: a few of the people who worked there seemed really in-your-face during the interaction.
POSITIVE,"Clean, decent place to stay. Would recommend to others.Pros: Comfortable bed and bedding. Cons: TV remote not very responsive. Not enough parking."
NEGATIVE,In the middle of a poor gang ridden neighborhood with bars even on the fence surrounding the hotel.Pros: Nothing
NEGATIVE,"I was pleasendly surprized to find, at first glance, that the hotel lobby was clean and well taken care of. We had a non smoking room but the room had not been cleaned. I reported it to the desk and was told the only other room available was a smoking room. I wasn't happy with a smoking room but did not have a choice. When I opened the closet door IÂ found a pair of mans slacks on the floor. Once again I informed the desk of the situation. He came and took the plans out of the room. I can overlook one issue but not two others. I will not be staying there again."
NEGATIVE,"Very convenient location nice amenities very large pool area and had nice clean rooms.Complimentary breakfast a real plus , staff very friendly and close to many great stores and access to highways."
NEUTRAL,Great location but noisy on the street. Will stay somewhere else next visit.
POSITIVE,Quick check in. Pet friendly. Brought my 1 1/2 year old Jack Russell. Only challenge - it appeared people including myself were having trouble with the door keys maintaining their ability to unlock the hotel room door. Great place to stay and seethe Karchner caverns. From hotel to caverns less than 15 minutes. Morning breakfast was terrific.
POSITIVE,"I booked this because of the location and the price, which was very reasonable. The outside and the lobby were nothing exciting, but I was stunned by the room itself. It was actually a full one-bedroom apartment, not really a hotel room at all. It was bigger than most Manhattan apartments I have seen. This was a business trip, but given the size, thisÂ will be on my list for my next leisure trip with the whole family. The only drawback was the old steam radiators, which made a lot of noise during the night."
POSITIVE,"All staff members were able to speak English, which helped because I don't speak French at all. The location is definitely in the old part of the city; streets are narrow and alot of one ways. Plan to pay for valet because there is no parking to be found!! I mistakenly thought that the continental breakfast was included, so prepare to pay for that as well.There was a very big party of students that were being loaded on and off of busses while I was there but I was not bothered at all. I stayed on the business class floor, it was very quiet!"
POSITIVE,"Great room! Loved the jacuzzi tub, the steam room and sauna. Would definitely stay again."
POSITIVE,"The hotel is in a not-so-great neighborhood, but like most of downtown SF, these neighborhoods are a short walk to better areas. Short walk to Union Square where there is great shopping, food, drinks and entertainment. The hotel is also just down the street from the Bart/Muni station which made it extremely convenient transportation to/from SFO and Candlestick Park.The hotel itself has a fun feel to it -- board game theme and bold colors. It had a little smell in the room, which was easily taken care of with a few sprays of my body spray. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom vanity area was large, allowing two people to easily get ready at the same time. The shower floor was slippery, but it did come with large individual soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers that were attached to the shower wall rather than the small, individual bottles, which was nice.The only complaint I really have is that we could hear a lot of noise outside our room. We got back late each night too, so the noises we heard were in the wee hours of the morning. Street noise is pretty typical of downtown SF, but I was disappointed that it was actually coming from people at our hotel. Since the hotel is motel-style with outside corridors surrounding a courtyard, the noise really carries.I did like that there was a lounge and a restaurant (Custom Burger), which was open for breakfast. Good food and reasonable prices, not to mention very convenient. Overall a pleasant stay."
POSITIVE,"We booked 2 rooms in the Tuscan section and loved it. In our room, remote control for AC unit not working and no bath robes (eg. for spa in courtyard) but one call to front desk and they fixed the issues quickly. Our 2 daughters are really impressed with the size and the decor of their room. They also enjoyed having breakfast outside near the fireplace. We will be back for sure."
NEUTRAL,"This hotel is close to the southern entrance of Yosemite National Park. We stayed for one night and although the beds could have been firmer, we had a good sleep. Bob, the hotel receptionist (graveyard shift) was really accommodating and gave us recommendations on where to go. We didn't book early but we're lucky enough to get a good rate on this hotel!!"
POSITIVE,"Our family really enjoyed their visit to Beaufort, SC. This hotel had a perfect location where you could walk to Bay Street for lunch and dinner and shopping! Great breakfast with a wonderful lady that obviously take pride in her job.! Clean and always restocking the breakfast items!"
POSITIVE,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 days in order to attend my 50th Class Reunion at Hoover High School. This hotel is exceptional ... from the desk personnel, the rooms and the breakfast bar in the morning. There is always a happy face to greet you or to wish you a safe travel home. I have stayed at this hotel every time I go to North Canton and it seems like it just gets better and better. I loved staying here and would recommend it to anyone."
NEUTRAL,"I was very disappointed with the housekeeping staff at this hotel. The room was never vacuumed during my week-long stay and the floor was very dirty. The bed was made when I returned each night, but the sheets were never changed. I did received new towels; however the shower/sink were not cleaned each day. The hallways had the lingering smell of cigaretteÂ smoke. It appeared the hotel is going through some renovations. I was surprised how quiet the hotel was being between a gas station and a bowling alley."
POSITIVE,Weather prevented us from continuing on to Cortez. We were lucky to find something close ... More than I wanted to pay . 127$ for two bed room ... But hey it's downtown
POSITIVE,"Down in the keys for one night. Chose this hotel based on price and it's a bit removed from the hustle and bustle. One exception, it's right next to the airport! No planes throughout night but they start at about 8:00 am and run through about 10:00. Beds were nice and comfy, nice linens as well. Overall a nice place to stay. Staff was great. Breakfast was nice with several options."
POSITIVE,"I've been staying here a few days a week since March, and will not stay anywhere else in town. The service is top notch, room is always clean, and the pool/hot tub/game room is a perfect diversion for the kids. The staff is awesome, exceedingly accomodating. Can't say enough..."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was conveniently located minutes from the aquarium with a free shuttle service. The breakfast was very good. There was a small roach crawling on the desk with the phone, which was not pleasant. But the room looked and smelled clean, so although a bit disappointed I will not kill them for that. Overall it was a nice experience. The hotel isÂ old, the elevator is a little spooky but it is neat and clean."
POSITIVE,The place was clean and attractive. The staff handled issues extremely well. They are professionals.
POSITIVE,"We were wary before we came, but were pretty impressed with this BW after our stay. We arrived much earlier than we had planned, and rather than turning us away since our room wasn't ready, the hotel manager offered to let us shower and change in the exercise room upstairs, and go ahead and get our parking pass at the hotel. While the rooms were a littleÂ old, nothing was in bad condition at all. Our suite was quite spacious, and even had an extra Murphy bed fold-out we didn't know about. Our room would have been excellent for a family. Our first floor room was also right next to the beach entrance, which was perfect. Convenience and price made this a great place to stay! If I had a minor complaint, and this is incredibly minor, the wireless internet in our room went off and on, but who really cares. Great deal, great stay!"
POSITIVE,"Hotel was ok for price not amazing.We book king bedroom was very big compared to other hotels I have stayed in. Had a couch area which most hotels rooms don't come with. Breakfast was free consisted of eggs, sausage, pancakes, bread, drinks. Free parking and shuttle were nice. Hotel was ok for the price. Clean room, nice free breakfast, free parking,Â free shuttle to hospitals and inner harbor. Room was very big. Biggest complaint was old tv in room, cable kept cutting in and out. Volume kept going up and down and remote sucked. Also hot tub in pool area sucked. It didn't filter and water was low so jets shot out everywhere. Other than that stay was ok not the best And def not the worst. Room was clean, bed very comfortable, staff was helpful, and free stuff was nice. Surrounding neigborhood not good."
POSITIVE,"New, beautiful, clean and tastefully decorated room. Large bathroom with heated floor and lots of space for a new york hotel! Front desk extremely helpful and courteous. Breakfast buffet well above average. And it was a BARGAIN. Dont hesitate, book a room here! In China town, walking distance to Little Italy and the Bowrey Ballroom for a concert."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable stay. Good location, clean rooms and tasty breakfast in dining room. Would stay again."
NEUTRAL,"I made a quick reservation on my mobile phone for this hotel while I was driving. What I apparently didn't see was that the one elevator in this was out. My room, 8th floor. I am in good shape so the climb up the stairs wasn't a problem - but I felt sorry for those who would have trouble with the climb. Lesson: look at the fine print and find out ifÂ there are maintenance issues with the hotel prior to clicking on ""book now."""
POSITIVE,"This hotel is very comfortable, especially the beds. Other than it needing a bit more attention on the cleaning detail, we enjoyed out stay. The breakfast was good, plenty of options for all tastes. Hotel staff was very friendly."
NEUTRAL,"Rooms were clean and adequate. If you are going for a brief stay this would fill the bill. And, if you are going for the shopping at the outlet mall across the street. The staff was courteous and the breakfast was so, so. The price was fair for my purposes"
NEGATIVE,"the room was clean and pretty basic... but the bathroom drain was too slow and water would always collect during the shower... and the bathroom shower curtain had some lint like thing all over...also the a/c generators are on four sides of the hotel and if you get a room close to them, there is a constant humming noise all night...."
NEUTRAL,"I chose Best Western Caribe Beach resort mainly for the reasonable price and the fact that we could share amenities at it's sister resort, Best Western Emerald Beach Resort. I will admit, the property is tired and dated, but it's clean and the grounds were beautifully manicured and in bloom. We stayed in Rm. #200. Clean, spacious, double bathroom, large balcony, lovely, private view of Lindburgh Bay, and the air conditioning worked fine. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Emerald Beach, which is just minutes away, although one day we were told that the shuttle was not available because the driver had lost the keys and we had to take a taxi AT OUR OWN EXPENSE, which we thought was pretty lame! If you have an early flight out, (which was the case with us) and will be leaving before taxis typically run (which will cost you double, and they're expensive to begin with!), I heartily recommend staying here as you can actually walk to the airport with ease. It's only 2 1/2 miles to Charlotte Amalie, so is also handy to town. We would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,We really enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious for our family of five. The breakfast was hot and plentiful. The pool was great fun as well. We did have difficulty getting towels replaced. We think the maid skipped us because we had a small dog in the room. The elevator was old and creaky and probably needs replacing. Pros: Free breakfast indoor swimming pool
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, nice buffet breakfast, nice size rooms, good stay!"
NEGATIVE,"We stayed at the hotel this weekend. It is filthy and poorly maintained. Sign states, ""Newly Remodled."" Fresh paint outside only. Would not recommend."
POSITIVE,"we stayed at the bestwestern in oakhurst for a couple of nights while we visit the yosemti park. the room was a very large room with 2 double beds, in a good condition. it has a small pool that was not available while we were there. but looked a nice place to sit with a beer. the room also has coffee and tea in the room. the south entance to the park is only a few miles away. i would recommend this hotel"
POSITIVE,"Good location, big clean room, comfortable bed. Breakfast area was a bit small for the number of guests staying. Overall good value for money for the area."
NEUTRAL,"A little to far from convention center to easily walk back and forth in short time frame although safe to do so if you have the time. Taxis where readily available to get back and forth though (but this does get pricey). Whole Foods close by. I say this because the on site restaurant is a Pool table bar/Sports bar, not really the most comfortable settingÂ for a woman travelling alone....."
POSITIVE,OVER ALL THE HOTEL WAS AVERAGE AND WHAT I EXPECTED. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THE AC IN MY ROOM DIDN'T WORK AND I THINK IT HAD FLEAS BECAUSE MY ANKLES GOT BIT UP.
NEUTRAL,"hotel was clean, etc. and the staff was great. However, not very quiet. Every sound in the halls and walking in room above carries right into the rooms though."
POSITIVE,"We loved this hotel it was really homely with a log fire and the reception staff really friendly and helpful offering free drinks, fruit and DVDs to borrow all free of charge. I emailed all 5 hotels we stayed at whist on my honeymoon and this one was the only one to decorate our room and leave champagne which was so nice. The hotel is right opposite a shopping complex aswell which is really handy and the diner on site is so cute with really yummy food I was spoilt for choice!! The staff were also fantastic in there and a big congratulations to the pregnant lady who served us throughout our stay she was fab! The rooms and balcony were big and had everything you would need without being too posh or modern. Would def recommend!! Room Tip: Email them prior to arrival and ask"
POSITIVE,"Had a GREAT 18 day stay at your Beautiful Motel. Thanks to Arlene, Patty, Vinnie, Kinny, Tony, and other staff members... You Guys are the BEST.... See ya June 2013:-) Thanks again....Joanie ""Lee"" Byrd....."
NEGATIVE,"I'm afraid there are a number of negatives: *Contary to claims, there is no ""free wifi"" as the signal is very poor throughout the hotel and it is impossible to connect *We reported a problem with our room and they said they would sent someone ""immediately"" but they never came *There is a shared PC in the lobby but this had a faulty power cable when we were there so would lose power and switch off without warning Positives are: *Located next to beach"
POSITIVE,Pros: The staff was fantastic. Cons: It's an older hotel. the housekeeping in the morning is loud and you can hear other guests leaving.
POSITIVE,"Very nice place to stay right in the heart of Moab. Place had a good light airy feel to it - casual modern Western motif, with a lot of windows in the lobby area etc. Pool and hot tub were nice after biking. Staff was very nice and helpful - suggesting resturants etc."
POSITIVE,I was greeted by the best behind the counter lady! She was pleasant and never lost her cool with anyone as busy as she was. Made everyone feel at ease - top class ambiance. Would strongly recommend this hotel. Will def go back in the future
NEGATIVE,Very unpleasant stay and staff I asked for the manager repeatedly !!! Never got any response. The whole stay as bad. I didn't sleep comfortable at all. There was numerous thing that went wrong and the manager didn't care!!!
NEUTRAL,Stayed here while traveling to Dallas. Tucumcari doesn't have much of anything so this was one of very limited options for our budget and standards. The rooms are good size. Clean enough except for the dead baby roach or beatle bug on the receiver holder of our phone. Our room looked directly onto highway 40 so unless you sleep with a/c on all night or use white noise machine you are probably going to hear it. Breakfast was your average free hotel breakfast. Same ol' stuff. Next time I will just bypass tucumcari all together and stay in Amarillo if going east or Santa Rosa if going west.
NEUTRAL,"the hotel was nice. It was very close to Mt Vernon, which was very nice after a long hot day of walking around the grounds. The room was ok. The hotel needs a little tender loving care but it was very clean. The staff was very nice. For what we needed, a place to crush, it was nice. I would stay there again. The free breakfast was ok. I have had better. Pros: The closeness to Mt Vernon Cons: The free breakfast. Location: Close to Mt. Vernon"
POSITIVE,"The bed and pillows were so comfortable! Everything was clean and nice about the room. You could tell they had recently painted the room, because the smell lingered a little. We will be staying again when in town :) Pros: Free breakfast Close restaurants Free Internet Quiet"
POSITIVE,"My husband and I were visiting famliy in a near by city and wanted some places cheap, clean, & quiet. It was all those things and then some. We showed up at about 12am and the night attended was very friendly and helpfull. Our room was clean and didn't smell of smoke like some older hotel rooms do. The bed was very comfortable. It was the best sleep we've had in a long time in a hotel. The shower took some getting use too, but all in all it was okay. I would definitely stay here again. Room Tip: The rooms with king beds have a couch that folds out to a bed. Also the Corner room next to the st..."
NEGATIVE,"Worst was the fact that all hotel staff was unbelievably unfriendly and unsupportive. Overall, the place seems to be in a state of decay since the Music Hall of Fame moved downtown (from across the street)."
POSITIVE,"This hotel was way above my expectations. I have never stayed in a BW but it was the only hotel available for my stay. The staff were very nice and helpful. The room was amazing, we stayed in the suite and it was really above all expectations. It was very roomy, bathroom was huge and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The breakfast was nice.Â The only bad thing I can even think of was the pool was dirty and cloudy and the hot tub smelled like gym socks. Other than that, the stay was great. I would stay again for sure."
NEGATIVE,"Stayed in one of the family suites for four nights. First of all: the family suite we had is essentially one big dark room, which means there is no privacy or possibility to accommodate different sleep/wake needs for the different members in your party: the King size bed faces the two queens. The entrance area to the room features a kitchenette and three seater leather sofa and a table that seats four next to a gas fire place. This area is actually pretty nice, but it has no separation from the bedroom that would allow the older people to do something after the kids are off to bed. The reason for this is that the entrance area is the only area with windows. The bedroom essentially is a three bed dark room with a sky light and an emergency egress door to the back. The ""suite"" features only one bathroom/shower-tub. Thus, considering that this place could in theory sleep six, there is clearly not enough bathroom capacity there. Unfortunately, this place is not only not very functional, it comes with a bunch of pretty hefty nuisances: the family ""suites"" are in a building separate from the rest of the hotel OVER a restaurant. I guess the rationale here is that people with kids don't get any decent sleep anyway, hence putting them over a restaurant, kitchen, refrigeration room where even when the restaurant traffic has finally died down and when the kitchen has finally been cleaned and the garbage thrown out in the middle of the night, the air handlers and refrigeration equipment will continue their humming and rumbling all through the night until early morning when the deliveries and the breakfast crew start to crank up the noise again. Next: someone thought that having lamps burning on the outside these suites all night would be a great idea but failed to install curtains on the inside. Which means it is hard to get ""lights out"" - the roman shutters don't do the trick... Third: the breakfast is disgusting - all processed food, crowded, thin coffee, no cooked oat meal, really the most unpleasant breakfast experience of all the hotels that we stayed in during this trip. Fourth, the most appaling room service experience in several years - of note: that makes it worst out of several hundred hotel stays: think ""really really lousy. Haven't experienced anything like this even at backpackers: The only recognizable thing the room maids did, was wipe out the sink and replace towels that were on the floor. Empty shower gel bottles weren't removed, towels weren't folded, the kitchenette are wasn't tidied, coffee wasn't replaced - but the room cleaning tip was taken every day. Finally, the price during the days of our stay was their rack rate, because the town was invaded by the Jeep Safari. Almost 400 bucks for this room and service level is a total rip and not only that, they even charge the full amount to our credit card on the day of our ARRIVAL; even if you hated the room and acted on it, they would have your money - this is not your usual preauthorization but the real charge. This makes me think that the management anticipates a considerable flight risk and makes sure they have you nailed the moment you walk in the door. In summary: on our road trips we hit the occasional Best Western, which never has been an experience that would justify the term ""Best"" anywhere in their brand. This was our first Best Western Plus: which was clearly PLUS on the room rate and PLUS on the disappointment. I would adamantly recommend to stay away from this place and really don't want to know what the others are like if this is one of their better establishments - as is advertised. Room Tip: don't book the family suite"
POSITIVE,"This hotel was very nicely kept and very clean. The room had a ceiling fan, which I've never seen before in other hotels. I felt safe and comfortable as I was traveling alone. It was very quiet. It has two restaurants and two fast food places within walking distance (no need to cross streets). I would definitely stay here again."
POSITIVE,Location : 5 minutes to Kennedy Airport. 24 hr shuttle service. Clean room and good bed.
POSITIVE,"Comfortable inn, however a bit overpriced, >50 miles from the North Yellowstone Park Entrance. Hard to find parking place late night."
POSITIVE,Location for visit was excellent all things were within a 20 minute drive. Free breakfast was very good alot of choices. Rooms were clean and pool was too. Shower could have been hotter. Pros: For the price it was very affordable compared to other hotels in downtown. Cons: Shower wasn't`t as hot as it should have been.
POSITIVE,Great staff. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel overall is homey and had all the amenities you might like for a few days stay (not to mention they allow pets). The trolley stop also made it convenient to Historic Savannah. Good restaurants/fast food nearby. Very convenient to I95
POSITIVE,The breakfast was very good. The room was very clean. The beds were appealing but the matress was not very comfortable
POSITIVE,Would absolutely recommend this hotel w/o hesitation.
NEGATIVE,"Stayed here on a Delta Interrupted travel voucher. Hotel was dirty, elevator floor sticky with unknown substance, hotel hallway outside my door smelled like Green Vicks Nyquil or spilled Ouzo Liquor, and staff was unfriendly. The night clerk was outside the front door of the hotel smoking while the desk phone rang. Worst part: dirty room, stained walls, and I woke up with 2 bites on my upper arms. I just hope that nothing came home with me and my only loss was peace of mind. Utterly nasty, you can do way better for 20.00 a night more at a Marriott property. Room Tip: Don't Go Here!"
POSITIVE,"There should be a level above 10 to rate this hotel. Everyone was extremely helpful and accommodating. The rooms and public areas were spotless and the staff was always visible doing little things to keep them that way. The restaurant was very good and, again, the staff was excellent. The location is convienent to the airport, highways and is an easy drive to Old Quebec. There is no doubt this will be our choice for future visits to Quebec City."
NEUTRAL,"We (two adults and two children) spent two days (late June 2012) at the Best Western Jasper in a loft suite. Pros: -- kids loved the loft with three twin beds and a big flat-screen TV (with lots of channels), -- adults loved the balcony with a mountain view, -- plenty of pillows, sheets, and towels, -- full kitchen, with normal sized appliances, allowed us to eat in (with two bickering kids, restaurants are not fun), -- full-sized coffee maker (I hate the tiny ones)---bring your own coffee and cream (they provide the filters and sugar), -- largely, sound-proofed room (the occupants of the adjacent room had a baby and we heard no crying,) -- set back from busy road but easy walk to Jasper shopping, including liquor and grocery store. Cons: -- No air-conditioning! This was a surprise, given the room rates. (It was OK when we were there---cool at night---but I would not want to be there on a hot, humid day,) -- Loft got hot, especially when cooking or making coffee in kitchen below, -- Because we had to open windows to cool down, morning noise from the parking lot was annoying (don't any motorcycles come with mufflers?), -- Pool was a bit small and the water cool. Check in was efficient and professional. Our housekeeping was erratic. On the morning of our second day, housekeeping came by and knocked on our door before we headed out (there was no âdo not disturbâ door tag to be found.) We told the gentlemen that weâd be gone in fifteen minutes and to come back then. Unfortunately, when we came back from a long hike at 4pm, it was clear that theyâd forgotten to clean our room. My wife went to house-keeping to get towels and they offered to clean right then but we were tired and wanted to use the room. I spoke to the manager while this was going on---she was not apologetic and a bit defensive. In my experience, tourist towns tend to have these kind of issues due to their transient staffing and the diversity of the customers that management must deal with. I spoke to the manager at checkout, who still did not explicitly apologize for the house-keeping error and proceeded to ask me what I wanted. I responded that it was her job to address the error, not mine. While I do realize that management may often deal with customers after a discount, I just wanted an apology over an understandable error. Apparently, a $50 discount is easier than attempting a sincere apology. In summary, if you get the loft suite with the mountain view this is a decent hotel. For the price we paid (approximately $200/night off peak season), Iâd probably pay more and stay at an air conditioned hotel with a more professional staff and management. Room Tip: Second floor loft suite with full kitchen and mountain view balcony is nice."
POSITIVE,"It was wonderful,I enjoy every moment.Kind of funny oddor inside the room.Other than that, theservice is neat and nice.The place is quite and contortable.The service of breakfat in the cafeteria is perfect and clean.What also:YOU ROCK BEST WESTERN. TTTHHHHHAAAAANNNKKKKKKSSSSSYYYYYOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!"
POSITIVE,"Really couldn't find much in the way of eating-out information. Only managed to find the nearby Denny's after 20 minutes of confused and haphazard driving. A bit more information on local dining would be excellent. Also, while the attendant at the desk indicated to the contrary, I'm fairly certain that the telephone in our room was broken. No dial-tone,Â nor did any pushed buttons have any discernible effect. Further, maybe it was just the time of year, but the ice machines were completely empty."
NEUTRAL,"Near airport Had room when stranded aaa rate adjustment Front desk staff were nice and resourceful-- printed directions and recommended restaurant. When checked in, I was told that Delta.com Skymiles offer that I showed front desk clerk wasn't available at this best Western location. I picked this hotel for miles points and am disappointed I didn't get 250 miles. Tv poor picture quality, and list of channels poor"
POSITIVE,Hotel staff was very pleasant. Rooms were quiet except for when people showered in the morning.
POSITIVE,We were very satisfied with our room and had a good nights sleep. Even though we came in late they were up and ready to welcome us. Pros: Nice hotel for the right price. clean with all necessary amenities. Cons: No complaints.
POSITIVE,"The hotel was very clean; the beds were comfortable; the pool was a pleasant addition. The kids loved swimming after a long day of sightseeing. Parking was a bit of a problem at times. We had to park behind the building a few times. But all in all, there weren't many negatives about this hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would return."
POSITIVE,We had an Awesome time and would love to go back. My kids LOVED it.. POOLS ARE AWESOME< RELAXING.. everything clean. Staff very helpful and accommodating....Thanks for making our stay memorable .... Room Tip: in door pool room
POSITIVE,"Great stay. The hotel is right on the main street in the center of Moab, but no problems with sounds of traffic. Comfortable beds. Great place to stage day trips to Arches and Canyonlands. Loved being across the street from Zax pizza buffet. Several nice little shops also easy walking distance away. Service was good - responded immediately to a problem with our room refrigerator."
POSITIVE,"Oh it was just fine. It's Best Western, not the Ritz, right? Lots of BW's offer a flimsy, limited breakfast. This one has the whole deal - good selection of foods, hot and cold. Pool is fine, also, if it isn't too crowded. Goes to 9 ft on the deep end, and has a rope to keep the kiddies in check. Rooms are standards for a BW, though the building probably dates from the 70's or so. (Has those nice big picture windows common from that time. Want more privacy? Draw the blinds.) Location is OK, staff were fine. Perfectly decent place to stay. It's BW."
POSITIVE,I happened to stay in this motel duing Mule Days so it was very expensive. The bed was soft and the pillows were hard. But the staff was very friendly and helpful and the motel was quiet. The room was also very clean. The room had a really good TV and with many stations to watch. It's conveniently located on the main drag on the north end of town. My personal Wi-Fi worked well too. I would stay here again. Room Tip: Try the first level behind the office.
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for one night when we were in California to visit the Jelly Belly Factory (about 20 miles away). This was a very nice hotel with good security, friendly staff, and nice clean rooms. As others have mentioned the air conditioner was VERY loud."
POSITIVE,"Our Stay at the Best Wester Designer Inn and Suites was great. The hotel staff was very friendly and really helpful. The whole hotel was very clean and homelike. It was right down from the downtown area and that was very convenant. The pool, hottub, and fitness room was very clean. They also allowed are dog to stay there which was very nice. The breakfast was great too. It is very close to attractions. Overall it was a awsome stay."
POSITIVE,The staff were very helpful and pleasant. We asked to have our two rooms next to each other and the front desk said they would do everything possible. When we arrived the rooms were not only together but on the first floor with a wonderful view! The front desk staff were helpful in recommendations for food selections as well as events. The entire atmosphere of Shelter Island was wonderful. You have the bay on one side of the hotel and the marina on the other. Anywhere we walked was a joy and all of the people in the area were very social. In all of our times traveling to San Diego we wish we knew of this location sooner. We will definitely stay here again.
POSITIVE,the location of the hotel fits as it is ran by native americans. it is not in Globe but the price made it a good deal. There is a resturant in the casino which makes it nice. The rooms are large and comfortable. There was one problem with thebathroom and it was fixed right away with no problems. I would recommend this hotel.
POSITIVE,"Friendly staff - front desk, room service, breakfast Extra touches - warm cookies, tea/coffee (perfect from a long day), complimentary toiletries, location, close to shops, restaurants. Nice look of the hotel - not spa relaxing, but feel relaxed - its quiet (even during this past very busy weekend), hotel looks nice, good swimming/whirlpool - towels/cleanliness. Like the sanitized remote control, fridge/microwave, glasses/cups. Liked room services choices available when staying more then one night (full service). Fitness facility - nice, clean, fresh Did I miss the instructions to set the alarm (oops) - next time I'll ask for a wake up call :-) Maybe some utensils and or dishes we could request from the front desk - forgot when reheating leftovers Liked the breakfast offerings - I know one place we stayed, they also had a variety of cubed cheeses (folks could use small tongs) - nice to add to english muffin w/ the hard boiled egg - heat/melt in a microwave (need in kitchen area)"
POSITIVE,"If you are visiting Moab, this is the spot. It is central to everything. Clean rooms and smiling staff. MUST STAY if you are going to Moab."
POSITIVE,Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Easy check in/out. Rooms were clean and spacious. Continental breakfast was plentiful with a good variety. Now if they would just get the overnight chick to join weight watchers or something this place would be perfect.
NEUTRAL,Rooms are ok. 96* outside and room thermo set at heat! Reserved ground floor poolside. We got 2nd overlooking pool.
POSITIVE,Rooms need updating with new furniture...room was clean but did not feel that way visually. The room where breakfast is held needs brightening up
POSITIVE,"Liked: Buen hotel, Centrico entre tucson mall y foot hills"
POSITIVE,The hotel was very new. The rooms were clean and well maintained. This hotel was a steal for the price we booked at. I would definitely recommend.
NEUTRAL,Room was clean and location was good. Restaurants were nearby.
NEUTRAL,Convenient and comfortable
NEGATIVE,"The first room we went in to smelled like someone had smoked a carton of cigarettes, even though we were in a non-smoking room. In addition, ALL of the furniture was ON TOP OF THE BEDS. Seriously! The table, the chairs, etc., etc., WERE ON TOP OF THE BEDS. I am not kidding. Really. I am freakin' serious. It was like being in a fun-house at the local fair. The words ""holy crap"" come to mind. I went to the front desk and the employee was very helpful and moved us into the room next door to the bizarro room. It smelled just as bad. Although this time the furniture was actually on the floor and not doing a balancing act on the beds. I returned once again and was put into another room, which, again stunk. We came to the conclusion that the rooms in this hotel all have a very musty odor as if there had been a flood (perhaps this is why the furniture was on the bed in the first room--it must have been trying to avoid going down stream) and perhaps there was mold growing in the rooms. In any event, at that time we decided to stop switching rooms as this was becoming aggravating and we were tired. In addition, the room felt and appeared generally dirty. The back of the bathroom door appeared to have dried urine on it. DRIED! It's WORSE than wet! Also, in the shower, we had to engage in a strange form of the chicken dance. The temperature would routinely jump radically quickly between horribly scalding hot and ice cold (similar to walking barefoot in Antarctica in the winter). I've never actually experienced a shower that changes its moods that quickly nor that violently, but it was massively annoying. I am working through this in therapy. And what about the magic soap? Really, I prefer liquid soap and I wasn't disappointed. Yes indeed. The bar soap started out in perfect bar form but with the horrible leak coming from the bathroom faucet, the bar soap quickly turned into liquid soap as it sat in a puddle of water. And, interestingly as that water dried, the soap would reconstitute itself into a bar like shape. This was highly inconvenient because: 1. I was deprived now of my liquid soap; and 2. It adhered itself like concrete to the counter. However one good note here: I finally ""got it"". Yes, I finally understood my 9th grade science class. Lastly, WiFi? What WiFi? I couldn't even check Facebook for the love of all that is good and holy!!!!! My friends had no idea of the terrible burns on my back (from the shower) and the nightmares (from the psycho furniture). Honestly, the WiFi would come and go. We did find however that the closer we got to the door out of the room, the better the WiFi was (coincidence? I think not!). So instead of lounging happily on the bed with our laptop, we glued ourselves to the door. Think velcro. Due to these problems--moldy/mildewy/smoky rooms, psycho furniture, CHICKEN DANCE!, needing to become overly familiar with the front door in order to use WiFi, and, uh hem, urine where it clearly should not be (bad aim?!), we will not stay here again, nor will we recommend this property and sadly, we will strongly consider these factors when considering Best Western in the future. Thank you for listening. Room Tip: Ummm...don't freakin' stay here?!"
NEUTRAL,Buena situacion Desayuno mejorable. Poco y de baja calidad
POSITIVE,"FROM CHECK IN TO CHECK OUT THE STAFF AND FACILITIES OF THE HOTEL WERE GREAT. THE HOTEL RESTAURANT SEEMED A BIT HIGHT PRICED FOR THE QUALITY OF FOOD AND SERVICE PROVIDED. DUE TO THE HEAVY TRAFFIC IN ABQ GETTING INTO AND ESPECIALLY OUT OF THE PARKING LOT WAS DIFFICULT. I HAD PURCHASED A PACKAGE DEAL FOR HOTEL AND AUTOMOBILE AND DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE TWO WERE MILES APART, MOSTLY BECAUSE I ARRIVED AT ABQ ON AMTRAK (AMTRAK HAS NO SERVICES CONNECTED WITH THE HOTEL OR CAR RENTAL) AND HAD TO FIND A TAXI TO GET TO BUDGET AUTO AT THE AIRPORT. I GUESS I HAD EXPECTED THE HOTEL AND RENTAL CAR TO COME TOGETHER AS ADVERTISED, FOOLISH ME. I WILL PLAN MY TRIPS MORE CAREFULLY IN THE FUTURE. THE PIX YOU SHOW OF THE HOTEL IS VERY MISLEADING. I THOUGHT IT TO BE IN A VERY ACCESABLE LOCATION."
POSITIVE,"I stayed at the Best Western Galesburg at the beginning of the month. The stay was fine as hotels go, clean room, decent bed, great wireless internet. The cable tv wasn't working the night I was there, but the wireless more than made up for it. I paid the next morning with gift cards, but when I got my credit card bill at the end of the month, they had still billed me the full price of the room. I called and within 2 days they had it all straightened out and refunded me the full price for the room that night. That is what I call customer service. Highly recommended!!!"
POSITIVE,"We chose to stay here for one night while passing through on our way to eastern oregon. We enjoyed our stay so much that we booked another stay for our return trip home. The first room was a standard. It was very clean and comfortable, love the bedding. Also liked the big comfy chair and ottoman. All of the rooms have an entrance from the parking lot and a sliding glass door that open up to a patio with seating and lush green lawn. Just beyond the lawn is the llama corral. And there is a lovely pool and large covered hot tub. My family really enjoyed the pool and hot tub. For a second stay we booked a suite with a jacuzzi and fire place. This room was spacious and nicely decorated. Very homey and relaxing. Easy to control the temperature. The jacuzzi was just big enough for two small people. The tile shower looked nice, but I wasnt that crazy about the shower head. Not sure what the style of shower head is called, it was a disc that was installed high in the ceiling and not adjustable. Anyway, it took a while to rinse all the shampoo and conditioner our of my hair. The bathrobes were a nice touch and roomy enough for a larger person. Overall, I was extremely happy with the accomodations and look forward to staying here again."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was very close to my destination for business. The staff was very friendly; I would definitely stay again; though some of the amentities need to be upgraded...the lamps, TV. Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet Cons: tv needs to be upgraded my hall light did not work..kinda dark in room the lamps switches were difficult to push in"
POSITIVE,"Our recent stay at the Best Western was great. The breakfast in the morning includes donuts from local shop, World's Best, so get there early. The balcony provides a nice view of the lake. Hotel was very clean. We stayed in a pet friendly room (even though we don't have a pet) and it's as if there had never been one in there at all. Centrally located and easy to walk to all downtown Grand Marais has to offer."
NEGATIVE,"I would not stay in this hotel again. Price was too much. Our shower would not drain, bugs were everywhere, there was a draining problem and the walls were warped from water, the bed was rock hard and the pillows were not comfortable as well as the hotel only provided a sheet and thin blanket. Pros: It was clean. Cons: Can not in less then 20 words."
POSITIVE,This was about the best run Best Western we have ever stayed at. We were vacationing in the Portland area and wanted to stay out of town in a nice place. The worked out great. The staff work their butts off and it was one of the cleanest hotels we had stayed in. The breakfast was simple - a standard for Best Westerns - but everything was always in supply and everything was fresh. We had a view of the river. Too bad behind the motel - their was a half finished restaurant kind of messing the view up. Also highway 14 was under construction. It was just nice to stay at a hotel that you really felt like you were a guest. Room Tip: try getting on room on the 4th floor over looking the river
NEGATIVE,The rooms are very small and even though they the hotel claims to be smoke free it still had a ''old smokey smell''. The lobby has been recently been remodeled which was nice and the breakfast was average. The swimming pool was another huge disappointment. It was one of the smallest pools I had ever seen in a hotel. The reason why we stayed at the hotel was that we could walk to Adventureland. Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet close to adventureland Cons: Noisy swimming pool too small rooms too small smelled like smoke
POSITIVE,"I've been to this Best Western a couple of times with no bad experiences. I rate it higher than any other Best Western that I've stayed at. Easy to spot from the highway and I was able to park my fishing boat very close to my room. There is a great lake nearby and as you would expect for a southern lake it's full of lilly pads and cypress trees. Fridge and microwave in the room, a comfortable chair and ottoman. The comp breakfast is just fine with biscuits,gravy, eggs, fruit, etc.. Krispy Kreme donuts! The location is on a busy commercial street with many other places to eat."
POSITIVE,"The hotel was convenient to what we wanted to do. It was clean and when we had a small issue with the TV, maintenance was there to help in 3 minutes! Although it was situated right next to a freeway, it was surprisingly quiet. Pros: The room was clean and quiet although right next to a freeway. Cons: Parking was somewhat limited and the spaces were very small."
NEGATIVE,"This is a hotel that may have been nice once in the past, but today, it is outmoded, unkempt, old, and plain dirty. The main entrance was dusty and littered with leaves. The rooms, as well as the lobby, have been designed and constructed in the 70s, and never refreshed, changed, or improved. The facility is depressing and uncomfortable."
POSITIVE,Very nice room. Brand new tv and comfy beds. The pool was perfect temperature all the time. Nice amenities .
POSITIVE,"This is a really nice hotel. They have a great pool area and a hot tub. The showers were awesome and the front desk attendant was enthusiastic about helping us and letting us know about all the off-roading trails. Con: No breakfast. Liked: Rooms, Service, Location Disliked: Food"
POSITIVE,"Nice...wish the pool would have stayed open past 10pm...or at least able to use the hot tub...we arrived late about 9:45 and would have liked to use it for just 30-45 minutes. breakfast the next day was a nice assortment of cold and hot items, however the hot items were not hot...still good though. just a helpful tip for staff to be aware of beforeÂ serving."
POSITIVE,"We have stayed at this property twice now. Great stopover on drive from Pinehurst NC to south Florida. (we travel with young kids) Rooms are clean, nice staff, breakfast is typical>needs more seating though."
POSITIVE,"Proximity to the airport and the free shuttle. For a tired traveller, the lack of food options late at night is a problem."
POSITIVE,I thought this was a good hotel but was failing in a few details. My biggest disappointment was not breakfast. All good hotels need a complimentary breakfast in today's marketplace when the bill totals $100 a night. There was also a burn out light bulb in the vanity and the ice machine didn't work in the pool/exercise room.
NEUTRAL,"This property is nice with good sized rooms and amenities. Location is good for anything you want to do in Corvallis or surrounding areas. My beware title comes from this: Upon checkout and a few miles up the road to the Oregon Coast my wife realized she had left her very expensive flatiron in the room sitting on the AC (left there for it to cool before packing it). When I called, the staff was helpful initially and told me no one had been in the room but the housekeeper. After looking for it, I was told it was no where to be found. Seemed pretty obvious to me where it was then. Amazingly enough when they contacted the housekeeper she denied having seen it (even though she was the ONLY person by admission to have been in that room beside the manager!!! I was livid and shocked that a reputable business would have such dishonest employees. I told them I would be filing a police report based on the obvious, still no flatiron. I did file the report, and told the incredibly nice and patient Corvallis City Police Officer what happened, and that I simply wanted the iron back and was hoping by them actually going there and making contact with the people it might generate some integrity. Well, the officer called us a few hours later and said he spoke with management and the housekeeper but they denied knowing anything about it and not to get my hopes up. I thanked him and went about my business. Wait, this is where it good! I get a call not too long after the officers call and I was told the flatiron had magically reappeared and was found on one of the cleaning carts, no one admitted putting it there (its just showed up). I was glad we got the wifes flatiron was back, but was very disappointed that a hired employee of a major chain would risk their job over a $200 flatiron, and it took a visit by a police officer to scare some integrity back into her! Makes you wonder what else they might take when you are out enjoying the city of Corvallis? I only give it an average (wanted to go lower) but do honestly believe the rooms are nice and priced ok for the area. To end on a positive note, the Police Dept in Corvallis is great! As a peace officer myself, I know it can be tough to take reports of such things because you know you will rarely have good news for the victim. Thank you CPD, and to BW Corvallis, hire some more trustworthy employees!!!"
POSITIVE,This is an absolutely stellar deal! Big value with a reasonable price tag.
POSITIVE,"The pool area is awesome, a perfect place for a family stay. The rooms are nice and were very clean. We enjoyed every part of our stay and will definitely be back!!!"
POSITIVE,This was a nice place to stay. It was right on the 29 which made for easy access to the vineyards.Pros: Lobby attendant was very helpful about the vineyards. Nice clean rooms. Cons: Breakfast wasn't as good as most Best Westerns.
POSITIVE,"The room was clean and quiet. It was nice to have the pool for the kids to use. Staff was pleasant, but not that friendly. The internet was horrible, so if you are coming for work related activities keep that in mind. Over all for the price it was ok."
POSITIVE,After maid service the towels were folded but damp. We had requested new towels.
POSITIVE,Pros: The location and employees. Cons: Cleanliness of pool and room.
NEGATIVE,"the hotel overall was fair..but my personal items came up missing. after trying to speak with the manager which handle the situation in an unprofessional manner put the icing on the cake.. I will never stay at this best wester again.stayed for 1 week P. Taylor Palestine, Arkansas"
NEUTRAL,"We've stayed at numerous Best Westerns on our trip from Michigan to the Canadian Rockies to Oregon. The BW in Valemount was nice but overpriced for what you get. This one of the few hotels in the Best Western chain that does not include a free breakfast. The room was large and had two TVs, a microwave and refrigerator. We know the area is remote and a ski resort but for an overnight stay while taking the ice fields highway, the value did not add up."
NEGATIVE,"Das Hotel ist OK aber die Umgebung machen es zu einem Albtraum. The Location of this Hotel in one of the dirtiest areas in Brooklyn and is one of the worst I've seen so far. If you are looking for an area for a scary criminal Movie that this is the place to go !! The hotel itself is OK but the location is terrible. You can smell piss and garbage everywhere, young man are hanging around on every corner and in front of some fucked up shops and trains are passing by in front of the Hotel (noisy)... If youÂ´re looking for an adventure choose this hotel. I am an experienced Traveler and have been to many cities and places around the world including Johannesburg and Sao Paulo, Mumbay, Shanghai,...you name it. I do not understand how one can place a Hotel in such an area. When I realized where the hotel was (Google Street View) I've booked another Best Western in Queens, but it was five minutes after Midnight and it was to late to cancel this Hotel even if I'have called they insisted that I have to stay. Bye the way the Breakfast was very poor for american standards and the girl at the phone was unfriendly. Parking is very limited and not guaranteed. I could never recommend this hotel to any traveler who is looking for a save stay in New York City. The Metro Station is close, but I would not walk there at night..... For around 200.- US$ a night you will find something in better locations, for example the Best Western in Queens...."
POSITIVE,"The staff was extremely helpful. The room was clean, comfortable and conveniently located to restaurants and shopping. The view from our room was spectacular. An unexpected delight was the complimentary morning breakfast which served everythingfrom egg dishes, ham/bacon/sausage, waffles and yogurt with granola."
POSITIVE,"Big clean rooms for a reasonable price during peak tourist season. If you want Door County during the summer and you only want one night on the weekend, this was the best I could find. Every place further up the peninsula required a two night stay on weekends. The pool and hot tub area was nice. The complimentary breakfast was standard fare, cereals, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and DIY Belgium waffles. Very comfortable beds. There is a very good neighborhood pub and grill within a very short walking distance. If you can not climb stairs, make sure you get a room on the first floor, as there wasn't an elevator to the second floor. Bottom line, I would stay here again."
NEUTRAL,Pros: Perfectly located in the Heart of Milwaukee downtown. Within walking distance from good restaurants and right across the downtown shopping mall. Public parking lot located right opposite the hotel. Public transportation and a conveniencestore located right outside the hotel. Cons: Room was very cold (heater was not working).
POSITIVE,"My husband and I stayed here while attending a conference in the area. The staff was friendly and helpful at check-in. We were on the 4th floor and never had a problem with noise. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. My husband actually commented he slept better there than at home. Breakfast was good for continental. Waffles, cereal, pastries, boiled, eggs, yogurt, etc. The breakfast room was small but didn't get overcrowded until Saturday morning. We would stay here again."
NEUTRAL,I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the years and the quality of staff never improves. Due to the influx of oilfield activity they are definately there to make money and put customer service last. Same Story for the Best Western in Beeville. Must be a new corporate mandate!. The carpets were dirty and there were numerous hairs still in the shower when we checked in. Amenities are minimal and so are the number of towels at times!. But if you are tired and dont want to drive to San Antonio or Corpus...this is the place to stay. Room Tip: Get an upstairs room to avoid hearing the person above you all night long!
NEGATIVE,The location is incredible! Â But that is it...it was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at. Â Every time someone got on the elevator you could hear it going up and down all night Â long and our room wasn't even that close to it. Â Also could hear toilets flushing and doors closing all night. Â Got NO sleep the entire night. Â I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone.
POSITIVE,"this was a great place to stay! the hotel is in a beautiful location. Conveniently located to area restaurants. The pool and hot tub were great. My only suggestion is, to send an e mail Confirmation. There was a mix up on our reservation. even though the manager was nice about it, An e mail confirmation would have avoided all of this. Room Tip: ask for a room facing the mountains, not the parking lot."
POSITIVE,very good staff was excellent location was good could use better cable tv more channels expand it
NEUTRAL,"Stayed at the BW Greenwell Inn for 1 night.. Reasonably comfortable room with the usual facilites - what spoit it for us was the position of the room. Rooms are around the ""L"" shaped parking lot .We arrived early evening,and went off in search of a meal - ended up at Eddie Mc Stiifs .Excellent meal - we had Orange Roughy. We had not realised that our corner room was one along from the Coco-Cola / ice machine until the constant rumblings kept us awake. Next morning we went to the Chinese restuarant on the right hand side as you drive into the BW for their ""buffet breakfast"" . OK ,we did not expect much for 6.99 but what we had was not very good (and that's being kind). coffee 2.50 extra- juice 1.85 extra. If you stay at the BW - make sure you do not take a room near the ice machine - and buy some breakfast items and eat in your room."
POSITIVE,"Have stayed here many times and will continue to. Pool is very nice and a great place to spend your time. Fantastic place for birthday parties too. Lighthouse water slide is great! Clean hotel with friendly staff. Restaurant isn't what it used to be, but still decent. It's close by to many other good eateries though. Room Tip: Poolside lower floor room."
NEUTRAL,Check-in took a long time. The front desk was having difficulty finding out if rooms were clean. Poor lighting in business/computer area. No ventalation in fitness room-very hot. Beds very comfortable. Wide variety of hot and cold breakfast items - very good.
POSITIVE,"good location, clean room, convenient to national park"
POSITIVE,It was very comfortable and affordable. We had been in Yellowstone and Jackson Hole and was appalled at the cost for what you got. A real rip off. Ruby's was very affordable and beautiful. We were with out family from Italy and they were very impressed.
POSITIVE,"We have really enjoyed our stays here. The rooms are very nice, the host is very helpful. The only problem we had was with parking. The walk from here to Disneyland was very pleasant."
POSITIVE,The room was kitschy and cute. We loved the enclosed patio and large room. The beds were comfortable.
POSITIVE,The stay was plesent and good. We all liked it and will recommend to our friends
POSITIVE,"The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Nothing extraordinary but I'd stay here again."
POSITIVE,"We came down for a weekend stay to visit with Family. We found the room to be clean, comfortable and quiet! I recommend staying here. Easy on/off access to interstate."
NEUTRAL,Not bad for an older Best Western type motel. Highway entrance/exit can be an exciting experience.
POSITIVE,"I like that I could count on the ""Best Western"" standard of cleanliness and overall ""room comfort"" (regardless of where I have travelled)."
POSITIVE,My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel because it was near Howe Caverns. We arrived late at night. We were able to park our car around the side of the hotel in front of the entrance nearest to where our room was. I rather be able to walk in through a side entrance than by a front desk and have to say hello every time I come and leave. Call me anti-social! The room wasn't super fancy. The decor was bland. Everything was clean. I always check for bed-bugs and there weren't any. i didn't see any hair on the sheets or anything of that sort. The shower was clean. We ate at the restaurant in the morning. We just missed breakfast serving time but the waitress was nice enough to still serve us breakfast. Interior was bland but it was clean and the waitstaff looked well groomed. I had the Eggs Benedict. It would have been good had it not been drowned in that sauce. (I think its called halandaise sauce?) It was still edible and looked fresh. The waitstaff was very friendly. I give this place an A-. (The minus because of the bland decor)
POSITIVE,"I had a training in Downey for my work, I took my family with me, we choose this hotel, and we really liked it. If we go to that area we will choose it again, it is kids friendly, and very clean, the breakfast was good. Room Tip: double beds"
POSITIVE,Excellent. The room was fine and from the moment of reservation to check out. Great service. Very close to Kaiser hospital.
POSITIVE,good
NEUTRAL,"Bed was comfortable, location was close to where I needed to be and the price was reasonable. There was a restaurant in the building so I was able to have breakfast before starting my day."
POSITIVE,"like others here..we booked through HOTWIRE fo an unbelievably low rate that included breakfast. the room was recently renovated and the bed was comfortable. our king suite included a nice sofa, microwave and fridge. This is a GOODIE!! BOOK it! Room Tip: side exit reentry is possible! so ask for the first floor near the exits for added convenience"
POSITIVE,"On a road trip we were unsure what hotel we would find in this small town, especially considering we had a dog. They were friendly, prices were reasonable, and location was amazing! We knew we were on the beach, but did not notice until the morning light that we were RIGHT on the beach! What an incredible room and view. Would recommend to anyone."
POSITIVE,"We stayed here for our 28th anniversary, and enjoyed our stay. The room was great, the king size bed faced the Pacific, so the views were absolutely gorgeous. The motel was very clean inside and out,and the staff were outstanding. We will return to Brookings for our 30 anniversary and stay here again. this was our best motel all week."
NEGATIVE,"The room was not clean, the air conditioner was loud and ran all night without effectively cooling the room. No soap in the room when I checked in. The hotel and the rooms did not look like the pictures on the web site. I/We will choose a different place to stay next time we are traveling through Fredericksburg."
NEGATIVE,"They'll be back @BWFalmouthBeach. Sadly due to a severe fire on 30/04/12, Best Western Falmouth Beach Hotel is closed until further notice."
NEGATIVE,"This hotel is NOT a family hotel, and that needs to be stated. My family booked 4 rooms to stay at for my brothers wedding, he had an arrangement with the hotel, and we were all on different floors. The fourth floor is a smoking floor, even though it has non smoking rooms on it, they still smell like smoke. And even though they say they provide cribs, they dont. When I asked for the crib they showed me a newborn infant crib that was not even put together! This was the only hotel I have ever been to that did not have a pack'n'play, and the manager said she was told by her supervisior that she could not get one either. Most of the rooms do not even have bathtubs, so good luck trying to bathe your young children in a shower. Breakfast ended at 9 in the morning!!! Who wants to go on vacation and rush out of bed by 9 in order to get breakfast? And again, if you have young children dont even bother because they dont even have one high chair in the whole hotel. Since we had traveled halfway across the country to go to my brothers wedding, a playpen and high chair were not things I could fly with and not being provided by the hotel really put a damper on things. There were no towels provided for the pool. Housekeeping told us to ask the front desk and the front desk had to go to housekeeping to get them. On check out day we were all checked out at 11 and we had to wait an hour or so for our ride to the airport. After waiting in the lobby and using the bathroom, we were told that we needed to leave because once we checked out we were not allowed to use any of the hotel facilities. Even though we had just paid for four rooms for four nights!!! I dont know if this is just how they run things in the South or just at this hotel, but we were all highly disappointed. This seems to be a business hotel and not one for families of any sort, and thats how it should be advertised."
NEGATIVE,"Upon arrival we were given a room that was under construction, had no help with our bags to the room. When we got the room switched out the room was old and smelled bad. We had to use air freshener. The bathrooms smelled like body odor and had no vent fan. The bed was very uncomfortable. When we called to the front desk to see if we could get an extra pillow and towels we weretold they didn't have any extra pillows and we would have to come down and get our own towels. It wasn't the worst it was just not what we wanted to have spent our vacation money on. ... Pros: It was close to the beach. Cons: It smelled bad and was very old looking and the beds were uncomfortable."
POSITIVE,Friendly and accomodating staff Cleanliness
POSITIVE,Doranda was very helpful when we got in. Best Service Clerk EVER! Rooms are very clean and comfy beds too!
POSITIVE,Logo and sign
POSITIVE,"Nice, new rooms, great to have a pool, slightly odd location by the freeway (but actually worked out well, as it is between downtown napa and yountville, which made travelling around the region very easy)."
POSITIVE,"It was a clean non-smoking room, staff was very nice. Check in was easy and stayed until 3 pm on check out day for an extra charge. The refrigerator and microwave were nice in the room, coffee pot and supplies came in handy too. They do need to improve on the amount of electrical outlets! Or just bring a power stripe with you for phones, iPads/laptops. Stayed on the pool side of the hotel on the ground floor and did not have any issues with noise and the pool was being used by other guest. Ate a nice dinner at Page's and had a breakfast and a lunch/early dinner at Perkin's, both just across the parking lot. Found both places to be nice and clean with average tasting food and service was good considering they were both understaffed with help wanted signs posted on marque and enterance."
POSITIVE,It was a very clean and we had everything we needed and if we needed extra things they brought it right to us. it was a good thing and the best hotell i have stayed in. cant wait to go again.
POSITIVE,"The house was great. The only complaint we had is that the website does not lead you to understand that this property is LITERALLY on the main road. it is in fact in walking distance to the Kitchen Kettle but on a very noisy corner. I mean, 24/7. We took a fan with us annd turned it up and we were able to sleep but my poor parents did not in the top left bedroom and were up all night. My inlaws stayed in the king room downstairs and turned on the air conditioner in the window and were able to sleep. GREAT house - just take a fan. I also told the rental office that the utensils in the kitchen were pitiful. they were broke and in very odd places. They told me they were going to tell housekeeping. The ambiance of thee house is great and the convenience. We WOULD stay there again - just be prepared! Room Tip: take a floor fan~!"
POSITIVE,"Maybe it's been awhile since I've stayed in a Best Western, or maybe I've stayed in too many budget hostels, but I thought that it was really nice. Far better than I was expecting. The rooms weren't cheap, but it was high season, and they were very spacious, very clean, and tastefully decorated. Nice toiletries are provided. We had two 2nd-floor rooms in the annex, one on the end with a patio next to it, and one more in the middle. I stayed in the room on the end, and heard no other room noise at all. My uncle stayed in a room closer to the middle, and could hear one of his neighbors stomping around. The only noise I heard was from the rain pouring onto the roof at night, which was unusually loud. I could park our car just behind the annex, and it's a short hop past the pool to the main lodge. The front desk was friendly, the lobby was comfortable and great for sitting and reading. Pool and gym looked clean and inviting, though we used neither. Breakfast was fine, nothing to complain about. The kitchen does its best to keep up with the demand for sliced fruit, there are frozen egg patties that you can heat in the microwave, there is no meat, there are lots of breads and muffins and cereal, there is oatmeal for people wanting a healthy option, and both kids and adults really enjoy using the waffle makers. The seating area is bright and clean. We stayed two nights and used the hotel as a base for driving through Glacier and Waterton Lakes. Downtown Whitefish is just down the street. I would have happily stayed for a third night if they had space, but we had to move to Kalispell. I definitely preferred staying in Whitefish over Kalispell, and would stay here again."
POSITIVE,"This is a great place to stay. We loved our room, it was clean with lots of space. Next time we go back to visit our family, we will stay at this place. Thanks for making our stay so relaxing and enjoyable."
POSITIVE,"Very comfortable spot! We LOVED being on the trails around the U of O campus, including the Prefontaine Trail and being right along the Williamette. Will will stay again!!!"
NEGATIVE,"This is a thieving dealership because they charge $1495 for four pieces of plastic that you can buy in any auto parts store for $8. Yes, that's right. These thieves believe that buyers are stupid. I wonder how many people were ripped off by this scam. Buyers beware."
POSITIVE,Very reasonable rate. Nice and quiet. Will visit again.
POSITIVE,"Nice, clean room...friendly staff. Close to downtown Charleston. I would definitely stay again."
POSITIVE,"just passing through, but the hotel was clean and comfortable (breakfast was also good, better than std. continental). Pros: Free breakfast Free Internet"
POSITIVE,"Loved the room, loved the staff, they really go out of their way for you. The food in the lounge area was great, the room service was prompt and reasonably priced and I enjoyed not having to leave the property if I didn't want to. Great location, and I was so comfortable there, everything you need is there. I will ONLY stay there on my next trip to Bozeman. The staff was really friendly and recommended some great places to eat! Way better than the ""average"" Best Western, this is a jewel in the chain. Room Tip: There is no elevator, so if you have a lot of stuff, try for a first floor room. However, if not, th..."
NEUTRAL,"Overall it's a nice place to stay, my room was updated & bed was comfortable!"
POSITIVE,We loved this place. The room was super clean with all the nice little amenities. The ocean front view was fantastic. The beds were quite comfortable and we didn't have any complaints at all. Worth every penny. Room Tip: Best to book directly with the hotel during the off season for lowest rates.
NEUTRAL,"The staff tries hard, but the hotel is won off and shabby. It would be acceptable for an off-exit motel when you drive across the country, but when in Vegas you should look for more enjoyable choices (and there are plenty of them!) for the same price. I only stayed there for two days when the strip hotels were fully booked for the superbawl weekend (it always comes unexpected for me)"
POSITIVE,We really loved this place. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We both got a good night sleep. The staff was friendly and courteous. You get a free breakfast in the morning and the selection was great. They have an onsite restaurant and bar. We had a great meal and drinks from the friendly staff and the price was what I had expected. The atmosphere was astounding and for all the people that were there it was very pleasant and quiet. I definitely will stay there again.
NEUTRAL,"We stayed here in the spring of 2011, off season. We thoroughly enjoyed North Myrtle Beach, especially this time of year when the beach and roads are not crowded. That is the good news. Now letâs consider the hotel. The first thing you notice is the parking. There isnât any. And when you do manage to get your car into a slot, good luck getting out again without whacking a pillar, a luggage cart, or a hotel guest (bonus points if you get all three). You can park in a small plain unsecured lot across the street. In the lobby youâll find friendly staff and the typically decent Best Western breakfast room. On the way to your room, if you need a luggage cart as we did for our group of four, the path to the room will make you think you were entered into a reality TV show along the lines of The Amazing Race. Your challenge is to discover a path into the tiny outdoor elevator foyer, get your cart into that foyer without letting it tip over, somehow managing to open the door and pull the cart through at the same time, figure out how to get the cart into the elevator with no room to maneuver and with everyone else standing outside because there is no room in the foyer for the cart and people, and then somehow get the cart out of the elevator. Rolling it to your room is then pretty normal. Getting into and out of your room: Would you expect this to be a challenge? These rooms have a dangerously high door threshold. I kept slamming my foot on the threshold, almost scoring a face plant after a one and a half gainer. This is especially pleasant when barefoot or in sandals (this is a beach property). Cleanliness is not this hotelâs forte. Of course, this is typical of lower cost beach front hotels. Thatâs not to say itâs bad. We had a clean bed and slept well. We stayed in their Executive Two Room Suite, a free upgrade for my diamond status. This room comes with certain unusual amenities. The air conditioning unit strives hard to be loud enough so you donât have to worry about maintaining your end of pesky conversations. It even puts out an odor that encourages a good game of âwhat is that smell?â It comes with a tiny kitchenette that had its most recent thorough cleaning a few decades ago. The second room has an uncomfortable work table and chair, a couch, coffee table, and small balcony. Sit in the couch and get an extended stay; youâll never get out of it. The free Internet access worked reasonably wellâ¦for three minutes of our three day stay. I reported the problem to the front desk and they later reported that it had been fixed. I suppose that would be true if you brought a directional antenna so you could pick up a signal from a neighboring hotel. My in-laws were isolated to their room, being unable to go out and enjoy the balcony because smoking is allowed on the balconies. So their neighborâs smoke wafted directly onto their balcony every day. I have more comprehensive information at FrictionFactor dot com. Counterpoint One of our sons stayed here at the Ocean Sands the year before and he and his wife enjoyed their stay."
NEGATIVE,"This room was crap. At first, we were put into a sauna of a room and told that ""it gets so hot upstairs bc of summer and I just turned the ac on because you did not have reservation"" , but clearly this was not the case, because the other room we got was comfortable. The ac was not blowing cold. We were given a different room, but when asked why the WiFi want working, the lady told us that ""our computer go down sometime"" ...... pretty unacceptable, and also an excuse. But its a bed that opens to an interior hallway, which is less than common around here. also, I have to note that I have three large bug bites on my legs now. Wouldn't recommend but don't be afraid to try it , maybe they'll improve things. Liked: Location, Value Disliked: Rooms, Service"
POSITIVE,"We booked the weekend to visit Blue Bayou Waterpark. I was very disappointed with the room the clerk gave us at first. It smelled of roach spray, We immediately asked for another room and was happy with the cleanliness of the next room. The atrium was not very well air conditioned and we were uncomfortable eating a very good breakfast. A quiet relaxingÂ weekend overall and we would not mind staying again."
POSITIVE,"Our very clean room was facing the pool area. It was very quiet. In fact, we did not realize how many guests were staying there until we went to breakfast. The full breakfast was filling. The landscaping full of flowers, cactus and palm trees was a pleasure to see in the December. We definitely would go back or recommend this hotel to couples or families."
POSITIVE,"Nice rooms, large bathroom, comfy bed. Even had working small refrigerator. Nice balcony. A/C and Heat both worked well."
NEUTRAL,"Nice room, great location, but something of a disappointment. Upon arrival at this lakeside motel, we immediately got a bad feeling from the chilly reception from the somewhat surly staff. Our room was nicely sized and fairly well appointed with a very comfy bed. However, the a/c was very loud and impossible to regulate, as was the shower temperature and pressure. And our promised ""courtyard"" view? A wall and a parking lot. The advertised 25 ft long breakfast bar was below average and well below 25 ft long. It was no surprise when upon checkout, no one asked whether everything was alright with our stay. (I really like when they do - its a good chance to offer a compliment or inform the staff of any problem.) Well, it wasn't, but they didn't seem to care. Room Tip: Pay the extra for lakefront view (in all seasons) - its beautiful out there!"
POSITIVE,"Staff was very good including Security Staff. Parking was convenient, a big plus. The only thing negative, which I can't figure out how they could change, would be street noise from trucks and fire engines and ambulances."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here after driving 13 hours. Room was large, clean, and uncluttered. Exactly what you hope for after a long day. Bed was great too!"
POSITIVE,Very nice for great pricePros: Friendly and helpful staff. Cons: None
POSITIVE,"Pros: Clean, comfortable and quiet. Cons: The water temp in shower was very sensitive."
POSITIVE,we upgraded to a view room - breathtaking view. the food at the downstairs restaurant - shuckers - was very good. the staff were always helpful. free computer use! self serve breakfast. close to lots of stores and food places. we had a great time. Room Tip: the balcony view rooms are worth the extra. we had to transfer to a first floor room for our last d...
POSITIVE,"I'm sure this place is not as luxurious as the Shorebreak down the street, but I had a very pleasant stay here. Our room was not outstanding but it looked very nice; we requested an extra sitting space (couch, coffee table, small desk, fireplace) for $10 more a night, which was a good deal. Our window, while small, had a great view of the ocean and the pretty little condos on the beach. I was always running in and out of the hotel like a little kid because everything is right down the street. Always got a smile from the man behind the reception desk. Definitely worth it if you can snag a balcony room with ocean view."
POSITIVE,"Service was excellent! Checked in March 24th for a 4 night stay. When we checked in we had just missed the free wine hour but the girl checking us in said she would have wine sent to our room. AND she did!! So nice of her. Hugo, the concierge was wonderful. Friendly and very helpful. The second day there they started remodeling the lobby which meant the check in desk and the lobby were temporarily moved to another area. They did such a nice job trying to make things as seamless as possible. I wish I could have seen the finished remodeled lobby. I am sure it will be beautiful. The rooms were nice and clean. The location is outstanding. Close to everything in the wharf. Their is a cable car line about a block away behind the hotel. There is also a Safeway just across the street and a Trader Joe's a block away. Even the hotel restaurant was excellent. I could not have been happier with this hotel. I would strongly recommend it!"
POSITIVE,Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Facility was comfortable. Outside areas could have been kept a little cleaner. Good value for the location for my wife and I.
POSITIVE,"Clean rooms, right on the beach, walking distance to restaraunts"
NEGATIVE,"Stayed here for New Year's Eve and purchased the CoCo Keys Party package. Lets just say my expectations were not set to an unreasonable standard since I was going for a Children's geared party. First, this is the first and only hotel that I ever stayed at that did not have comforters on the beds. Which if this is their standard that is fine, but if a request is made for blankets it should be fulfilled. The room was booked for 4 people and only 3 towels were provided. We called the front desk as soon as we arrived to have more towels brought and 3 extra blankets. And to leave them in the room since we were going to the pool. At the water park we reserved a Cabana which by the way no longer includes a safe and waitstaff as they previously did, and no mention of the downgrade of service. Apon returning to the room, we did find the towels that were requested and 1 blanket. Fine, we get ready for dinner which was included in the package as a buffet that is avalible for 1 and 1/2 hours. Bring the kids down to where we were told it was located to find that it is held in the ""Arcade"" which didn't have the arcade games delivered in time which was part of the package but also this it the walk through from the hotel wing to the water park, so in other words ""The Hallway"". When expecting a dinner buffet to be served at a ""resort and conference center"" I would at the very least expect to be served in a place other than a Hallway. Not only that but they only had one serving station that was open on only one side of the table and didn't even have enough tables and chairs set out to accommodate the people that were already seated and the people in the line by even close! Not to mention that in order to even get the food you would be standing in line for at least an hour! After waiting for a while our kids were so hungry that we ended up taking them out to eat instead since they ended up eating faster that way then waiting in the line for the buffet that was offered and by the time we would have made it to get food the ""dinner time"" would have been over. I requested to speak with the general manager about this, and after a 20 min wait was approached by the Front desk manager who I voiced my complaints to and again requested blankets. She stated that first an for most she would make sure that blankets were brought to the room and if we would go and have dinner in the restaurant she will make sure the general manager would come and speak to us. In this fine dining restaurant that has white table cloths and all, we found while some of the wait staff were dressed appropriately, that the other half either had dirty un-ironed uniforms or was wearing the uniform inappropriately for a restaurant that is suppose to be toted as ""fine dining"". All of the staff were not appropriately trained on the menu and what was being offered and how. It was very disappointing. When we returned to the room we not only find that no blankets were brought to the room still but everyone in our party that had the pizza for lunch at the water park now is sick and running back an forth to the bathroom. One in our party finally went back up to the front desk to not only find that the front desk manager had left for the night but to also, for the 3rd time ask for blankets, and actually got them this time since she refused to leave the front desk with out them and had to finally end up following the staff member to the closet to retrieve them. She did so just to make sure that this time we would actually get them. Now we did return to the front desk to again ask to speak to the general manager to voice our concerns to find, on the busiest night in the hospitality industry of the year, being approached by a man that was attired in faded navy blue dockers and a faded navy blue sweater. Which at seeing this explains the lack of concern in the appearance of the waitstaff in their fine dining restaurant. Who turns out to be the general manager of the ""resort"". His negative attitude and clear disinterest in hearing the complaints were only topped off with his nasty tone as he asked ""What is it exactly that you want me to do for you?"" When told nothing and I requested a business card with his name on it, I'm sure you could share in my shock that he didn't have one. In the end I ended up with someone else business card with his name written on it. This Hotel was very pretty. But that is where it ended. You pay TOO much money to be treated poorly, beds with no comforter, to be served dinner in a hallway with out a place to sit if you can wait in line for an hour, poorly trained and attired staff, and a general manager who clearly thinks he is better than everyone and doesn't believe his customers are deserving enough to even come to work properly attired as a general manager. But on a good note, right down the street less than 5 minutes away you can eat a an Old Country Buffet where all of their staff are friendly and wearing clean and pressed uniforms to the point of not one of them did not, not have a crease in their sleeve."
POSITIVE,"We were quite amazed by the size and the amenities offered by this hotel. The room was nice and had everything we needed. The breakfast buffet was great and there was lots of seating. The hotel offered several activities onsite, including bowling and an arcade room. There was also a nice sports bar. The only problem we encountered was the ventilation in the bathroom. The fan ran quite loudly, but accomplished nothing. By the time the 4th person took a shower, there were water droplets on the ceiling that fell on him as he tried to dry himself. The mirror was still steamed over when we got back from breakfast. Other than that a great place, for a good price. Pros: The game room and sports bar in the basement. Cons: Ventilation problem in the bathroom."
NEGATIVE,"Disliked: Rooms, The un clean rooms taking a bath finding that your sharing it with last person bodily fluids, Mindless staff that does nothing to resolve a problem acept regirated corperat dog ma."
POSITIVE,"This BW rocked! Â We paid $85/night with our corporate discount and asked for a room on a high-floor with a view of the bay. Â Boy did they deliver! Â 10th floor with the beautiful US India docked at the harbor - uplit at night it was an awesome sight from our room and balcony. Â We were surprised at how modern and wonderfully apponointed our room was - from the fixtures to the artwork to the flatscreen, it was like everything was brand new. Â Bed was crisp and comfy, maid service was excellent and the complimentary breakfast really wasn't as bad as other reviewers complained (we were surprised it included hot food). Â We walked to Balboa Park one day and to the Gaslamp area at night and didn't feel threatened by the neighborhood at all. Â Sure, you could hear the train, but that was part of the charm, for us. Â The front desk staff was extremely accommodating, called us cabs whenever we requested, executed daily wake-up calls and took the time to point out local attractions on a handy map (thanks, Miho!). Â We will definitely stay here again when visiting the area and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family."
NEGATIVE,"STAY AWAY! I was robbed by the house staff here. I left an iPad in my room. Its (was) my favorite toy so I take good care of it. When I went back into the room it was gone. Housekeeping had been there. I was the only person staying in this hotel that morning- so I know it wasn't a guest. The Managers were NO help at all and even incredibly rude and argumentative. I got the police involved- who were super nice and helpful, but unable to do anything much. I also called the national Best Western offices who also told me they were unable and unwilling to do anything since it was independently operated. I was so frustrated dealing with this place, they would not refund my money, and they stole my stuff. Stay away. I am so angry a member of their staff got away with robbing me, and the management of the place was not even really willing to consider the possibility. Disliked: Rooms, Service, Location, Value, Food"
POSITIVE,"If i got more cleaner towels, i would give a 5 star review. Liked: Rooms Disliked: Clean"
POSITIVE,I really don't know thier names.. but all the front desk staff were lovely and the repair man that came and fixed the heating unit was very nice too. Liked: Service
NEGATIVE,Went outside for a smoke and when we got back we got locked out the keys no longer worked.... Disliked: Service
NEGATIVE,The room was dirty and there were ants in the bathroom. I wouldn't recommend staying here. Disliked: Rooms
POSITIVE,"Great hotel and location, will be back next time I'm in town."
POSITIVE,Liked: Rooms
NEUTRAL,"The hotel charges a resort parking fee $5/night, upon arrival, we were told that ""by the way, we have a resort parking fee that Expedia did not tell you about"". I specifically paid more to book this hotel (over Holiday Inn on the other side of Disneyland) because I was under the impression that they would not have a resorting parking charge. But I guess you live you learn. If I could redo it again, I would have booked the Holiday Inn (Holiday Inn charges $10/night for the resorting parking fee, but for what is worth, pick Holiday Inn, at least it comes with Continental breakfast option and the total final price is still cheaper than Best Western). Also, be mindful that the set up of this hotel looks like a motel (literally), think of Motel 6, Super 8 where you park your car outside your door, but if you don't mind that, then it's a go. In a nutshell, if you are able to get a good price on this hotel, then stay here; if you're expecting a nice hotel environment, look into other ones. Liked: Rooms, Location, Food Disliked: Service, Value"
POSITIVE,"This was a wonderful hotel in Branson, MO. We have visited Branson a few times and have never spent so little on a hotel that was up to par with the more ""luxurious"" brands in the area. We were both extremely impressed."
POSITIVE,wifi did not work
NEGATIVE,The carpet had multiple huge stains. The walls are really thin and every time the bathroom or shower was used next door or above us we could hear clearly. We were on the first floor and could also hear every step taken by the poeple upstairs. Goodthing we only had to stay one night.
POSITIVE,"Our family has stayed at this hotel many times and we've always been very pleased! Conveniently located, great rooms, reasonalbe prices and customer service is acceptional! Can't say enough of good things...once you park your car you leave it until your departure. Everything is within walking distance so the location is great! The rooms, indoor pool, hot tub, sauna, outdoor pool, landscaping just amazing. Very courtous and friendly staff! We've stayed three times this winter and there was nothing better then going in the warm pool or hot tub after skiing all day. Although many options, the summers are great here as the outdoor pool is huge, overlooking Lake George."
POSITIVE,"We would highly recommend this hotel. We stayed for three nights, the room was spacious, clean and well equipped (even though the bed was a bit on the hard side) Leisure facilities were of an excellent standard and added to the enjoyment of our visit. The food was fabulous (well worth trying as many different dishes as possible during your stay) a good selection and imaginatively presented. The service we received was first class, all staff were very helpful. A special thanks to Craig and Sheila who served us in the restaurant - they were especially friendly and courteous, even when very busy. We look forward to staying here in the future. Room Tip: Not too near the fuction suite (late night noise)"
NEUTRAL,"Clean, large room w fridge, good shower. Wireless worked fine. Within walking distance of restaurants, grocery, bike shop, souvenirs, info center. Nicely run. No view but was in Moab for hiking and biking w 20 yr old son and did not need aview. No breakfast but what do you want for this price?"
POSITIVE,"On August 27th 2011 we held our 30th Wedding Anniversary reception and party and in the Baronald Suite of the Cartland Bridge Hotel. The hotel and grounds are stunning and the interior of the hotel is very well presented and did not suffer from that old rundown look so often seen in other hotels of this type and age. In the weeks prior to the function the Manager (Mr Robert Duncan) went out of his way to help and be of assistance, and the staff at the hotel were fantastic and extremely helpfull at all times. Our function was held in the Baronald Suite and when guests arrived at the hotel all were greeted by the staff with a glass of champagne and a lot of smiles. We booked a package at the hotel which included drinks for all guests on arrival, a glass of wine with dinner and for the toasts. It also included a 4 course meal with good choices from the menue and the food and the service was excellent. I should also mention that as well as our function taking place there was also a Wedding fuction being hosted at the same time in another suite (the Lanimer Suite), and we feel that all due credit should be given to the hotel and staff for coping admirably with these both functions simultaneously, Excellent Service!! The value for money, service and food were all excellent and everything went according to plan with the help from the hotel manager and his staff. All our guests commented on the great atmosphere, food and service. Based on our experience with this hotel and staff we would highly recommend it to anyone for functions or similar events. We cannot comment on the bebrooms/ accomodation as we did not require the use of them for our function."
NEUTRAL,Keeping in mind I stayed here on St. Patrick's Day...I thought the hotel was very unassuming on the outside. Nothing special really but the inside was well kept and the staff was friendly. The rooms were somewhat small but then it's a hotel roomand I don't need that much room. The only downfall to our stay was that it got somewhat noisy after bar close. I could hear conversations and traffice clear as day from inside our room unfortunately. I would definitely stay here again though as it was close to downtown and at a good price compared to other hotels.
POSITIVE,"We chose the Best Western Loyal Inn for my daughter's wedding. We reserved 12 rooms for the wedding party guests including family from the Philippines, Arizona, Boston and New York. The hotel was conveniently located to the Seattle Center-home of the Space Needle, The Center for Wooden Boats on Lake Union-the wedding venue and close to downtown. We were upgraded to a suite without our knowledge but were very grateful as our room provided a great meeting and congregating room for family and friends. The staff went out of their way to ensure that everything was perfect for my daughter and guests and even put little extra amenities like fresh sunflowers, nibblies, waters and cookies-even a Congratulations balloon for my daughter's stay. The facility was clean and the staff was organized, efficient , gracious and accommodating. I recommend this Best Western wholeheartedly. They have two other properties in Seattle and I will assume they are equally great. Two key staff members who went above and beyond in taking care of our party were Samantha Young and Kelly Sheehan."
POSITIVE,"We chose and booked this hotel for a one night stay the evening before we cruised out of San Juan. Most of the hotels down by the cruise terminal were fully booked, or extremely expensive (it turns out that the weekend we were there happened to be the same weekend as the San Sabastian Festival, which draws 150K-200K people to Old San Juan). We booked this hotel through the AAA website and booked 3 rooms (1 double queen, and 2 single kings). It turns out that the AAA site offers rooms that are not available at the actual hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, the clerk told me that they could only offer 3 single queens. After much discussion with her and her manager (by phone), they gave us a fourth room for free and discounted two of the single queens that should have been kings even more. Needless to say, this helped the rating of the establishment. The hotel was clean, and there is free wifi on every floor. The front desk and staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast was merely breads, fruits, and cereals, but it was free and constantly replentished in spite of the crowd. It was easy to get a van to take our group to the terminal. There was a hopping medium sized sports bar across the street that served food and cold beer and had lots of televisions called Buffalo Wings. Best option for watching a game and getting a bite. This hotel is listed on some travel websites as having a casino, but it does NOT anymore. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are needing a one night stay before or after a cruise out of SJ. Very inexpensive and simple hotel, which is just what we were looking for. Room Tip: Although connected to the airport, the rooms are quiet."
POSITIVE,"We stayed for 1 night just before Victoria Day in May. The hotel is situated on a busy road but we couldn't hear any road noise at all. Our room was a good size, well maintained and very clean. It had a small kitchenette unit made up of a sink, 2 hotplate rings and a fridge as well as a selection of basic crockery and cutlery. There was also a microwave and so you could make simple meals if you wanted to. Unfortunately the television didn't work in the room but someone did come up immediately to try to fix it. It didn't matter to us as we didn't want to watch anything other than the news and weather. The front desk staff that we met were friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast area is small so it can become congested especially if some people don't think and block the access to the food choices. The choices were good although not always replenished unless someone specifically asked - when we stayed there were also 2 teams staying - a young group of softball players and a group of lacrosse players so plenty of food was needed butit wasn't always there. There is a computer available for general use in a small room off the lobby - the internet speed was good - and there is a printer to use as well. We would choose to stay here again if in the area."
NEUTRAL,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by what I got for $70. I won a bid on priceline by naming my own price and got a room with a comfortable queen-sized bed. I shared the room with my best friend. Not only did the room come with free wifi, but my bff and I were also able to enjoy complimentary breakfast. Most places don't offer boiled eggs for breakfast and I was on a non meat diet. I needed my protein and the boiled eggs were just right for me. Bathroom was a nice size and clean. I noticed however, that the ceiling tile showed signs of rusting. As Catalina O. stated I noticed that they had basement rooms. I agree it would suck to have stayed in a basement room for the price that she paid. Our room was on the first floor, but we got a corner room and it wasn't bad. Oh, I was also pleasantly surprised that I was able to check-in online and print my confirmation from a computer in the business center. This hotel is very conveniently located from the airport and I'd definitely come back for $70 a night if I ever got stuck in the airport. Just make sure to name your price through priceline."
POSITIVE,"I was traveling cross country and needed a place to stay for the night. I found the Best Western Adobe Inn and it fit the bill. The room was large, clean and quiet. Breakfast was tasty, though just your normal hotel breakfast. My only complaint was that the parking lot was a bit difficult to get into and out of with a moving van and car trailer, but most people aren't likely to have that problem."
POSITIVE,"Stayed here on a cross-country trip. I really like these old motel style places - all first floor rooms you pull your car up to (ranch style). Room was large and very nicely decorated. Next door to a Denny's which was important to me as on this trip I was looking for motels within easy walking distance of places for dinner (too many hours in the car). Good free breakfast including hot waffles. Nice folks at the front desk too. If I were passing through here in the future, I'd defintely stay here again. Used motel book coupon for a great rate."
POSITIVE,"Greenwell Best Western is on the main business street, near the center of Moab, making it easy to contact agencies and businesses. The room was generous with good facilities. There is no onsite restaurant, but there is an abundance of goodrestaurants for all meals within easy walking distance."
POSITIVE,I thought this was a good hotel but was failing in a few details. My biggest disappointment was not breakfast. All good hotels need a complimentary breakfast in today's marketplace when the bill totals $100 a night. There was also a burn outlight bulb in the vanity and the ice machine didn't work in the pool/exercise room.
NEUTRAL,Stayed here while visiting Arches. Place was ok but avoid the lower level- we had to listen to the people upstairs walk around all night!
NEGATIVE,"DON'T BOTHER TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE. They advertise wi-fi, but it doesn't work. The clerk reset it, but it still didn't work. The bathroom sink was clogged, and the toilet bowl was not clean; the bed mattress was old and sagged where too many people sat too many times; the lights in the stairwell to get to the 2nd floor room were off at dusk; and the selection of food in the breakfast room was limited and not competitive with hotels asking the same price or more. I would have asked to change rooms but everything was unloaded from the car. However, if this sink was clogged what makes you think the next room will be any better? While brushing my teeth, I had to wait for the water to go down before I could rinse out my mouth again. Nice way to start the day. The breakfast room was very tiny for the size of the hotel. With two sprawling buildings the breakfast room had about 5, 36"" round tables crammed into it. The food selection was bad: poor quality bread, danish, and muffins. Looks like they bought everything at WalMart. They had packaged oatmeal, but no micro-wave to cook it. No water to drink, not even a pitcher of water since there was no sink in the room. Hello....is there a Dept. of Health out there. How do they keep the place clean? No hot eggs, no gravy for biscuits, only a waffle maker. I got the impression this particular franchise tries to do everything on the CHEAP. The carpet in the room had not been vacuumed in the corners and between the furniture - dust was building up. The bed linens were all crumbled, the fitted sheet barely fit the mattress; and the cheap white towels were gray, dingy colored. Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere."
POSITIVE,"Well maintained, clean, and pleasant hotel close to the airport and shopping in Seattle's Tukwila neighborhood. Free air port service, parking, and breakfast included. There is a huge mall nearby, with lots of stores including a very large Costco. Continental breakfasts include a variety of items such as toast, waffles, eggs, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. Guests may take food back to the room which has a small fridge, microwave, and coffee machine. Wireless internet access in the rooms is quite slow, and the computer in the lobby may have other guests needing it. Beds, bedding, and rooms are clean and comfortable. The facility has a very small outdoor pool used in the warmer months. Not great for those looking to find a well equipped fitness and workout areas, but the basics are there. Having stayed here before I would recommend this hotel to those with vehicles, who enjoy being close to shopping and major roadways. Some good familiar American restaurants nearby like The Cheescake factory and Red Robin. Although you may hear the train whistle once or twice during the night, the hotel itself is fairly quiet. If noise is a concern, be sure to ask for an upstairs room at the end of the hallway. The specials offered at this establishment can be quite worthwhile so check around before you book. Bookings using the Best Western site can sometimes be more expensive, but they do provide cancellation and ""change"" provisions not available through other hotel sites. Always read the fine print! Room Tip: End of hallway upstairs rooms are quieter. You can hear people walking by in the hallway."
POSITIVE,"Hotel looks old but rooms are up to date; each room has a refrigerator and microwave. Centrally located with restaurants, WalMart, gas stations, and main highway nearby. Service was excellent, changed my room when I was told that I have a smoking room. However, free breakfast was cold and bread products were stale. Friday night, some idiot decided to use the parking lot as a drag strip because it rained. For the most part, probably would stay here again. Room Tip: Ask to see if other rooms are available"
POSITIVE,"The hotel was conveniently located, and had a good variety of eating and shopping nearby. The interstate traffic was noisy when outside, but the room was well sound-proofed. We had the deluxe king suite, and it was well equipped with full kitchen amenities and comfortable rooms. The basketball court and pool and hot-tub were all well-maintained. TheÂ breakfast buffet was very good and the surroundings were pleasant. We would use this hotel again."
POSITIVE,"Staff pleasant, room clean and tidy for their age."
NEGATIVE,This was the largest best western i have ever been in.We were forced to come here because there was nothing available in bay city or frankenmuth.We had to carry our bags up stairs.No elevator. I would not stay here because it was a drive from bay city and that having to use stairs was unacceptable.
POSITIVE,"Great location. Close to the train station, Cubs park, very nice neighborhood hotel. Parking is right next door and they are helpful and friendly."
POSITIVE,"This Best Western is so nice and smells SOOOO clean, which is a biggie for me. I was very impressed. The rooms were very large and very reasonably priced. Bed was nice, halls were quiet. Good continential breakfat included. Close to lots of restaurants and outlet stores. Pool was nice, clean and not OVER clorinated. When we entered the room and used the bathroom the toilet was sluggish, we called down and it was fixed with in 10 minutes...WOW fast service. The only issue (but minor and not an inconvenience) was the smoking rooms are in the hall on the way to the pool area and you could smell a stale smoke smell there. Not a huge deal but may bother some guests. Overall a very nice stay."
POSITIVE,"The room amenities were nice. The pool was a little to cool to feel comfortable letting my child play in, but the pool area was kept nicely and the hot-tub was a good temperature."
POSITIVE,"This is a really nice place and I would happily stay there again on a trip to Tucson. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Everything worked except the Wfi - and a technician showed up promptly to get that going. (We didn't have the tv on.) The bed was wonderful, and the breakfast was lovely. The location was convenient for our purposes on this trip, and would be ok for most others I would think. I found the whole place sort of uncomfortably wedged into a smaller than needed building area. Everything felt a little cramped, except the room. The parking was especially awkward and tight. I was more aware of this than usual as we were driving a rental car which was oversized anyway (not our choice) and really wanted to return it undamaged."
NEGATIVE,The carpet had multiple huge stains. The walls are really thin and every time the bathroom or shower was used next door or above us we could hear clearly. We were on the first floor and could also hear every step taken by the poeple upstairs. Goodthing we only had to stay one night.

There is no onsite restaurant, but there is an abundance of goodrestaurants for all meals within easy walking distance."
NEUTRAL,"The location is perfect, just a quick jump to the Colorado River, Arches National Park, Dead Horse Park and Canyonlands. The room was actually quite nice, the only problem with it is that you can hear the person above you. If you are on the secondfloor it's no problem, just try to avoid the bottom floor. Teal at the front desk was very helpful. We had checked out and grabbed some food to go at the place across the street and Teal chased us down to tell us that my wife had left her sweatshirt in the room. Good Value and great location."
POSITIVE,"We were on a two week tour of the National Parks of the South West and had a three night stay in Moab in the middle of our holiday. I can not praise the hotel highly enough for the level of cleanliness in our room. It was the cleanest hotel I have EVER stayed in, anywhere in the world. The room itself was lovely too, and well equipped with a full-sized fridge and satellite TV, an armchair and a sofa, and plenty of storage space. There were sinks both inside and outside the bathroom, which was very handy. There is a small laundry in the basement (complete with useful bill-breaker) which we found really useful for ""freshening up"" our holiday wardrobe! Breakfast is included in the price and is self-service, but there are hot dishes of eggs, bacon, and the facility to make toast and waffles, as well as cereals etc. You can eat it in the dining room or take it back to your room. The location is bang in the middle of town and close to all amenities and lots of restaurants and places to eat. I can recommend the shakes, floats and burgers at the Moab Diner! We also had lovely past at Pasta Jay's, which is practically on the hotel doorstep. If I had one criticism it would be that the staff on the reception desk were a bit lacklustre, and one of them did not know the location of a Thai restaurant which it turned out was on the next block. It is not a big town and I would have expected the staff to be a bit more knowledgeable. There is a pool and hot tub, neither of which I used. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to stay there again."
POSITIVE,"A place to recommend. Friendly service and a lovely welcome. Nice room, good size and well appointed. Location is excellent for outdoor activities. Easy to get to local shops and restaurants. Has a nice pool and loads of parking. The upstairs veranda is nice to relax in too. Be warned that breakfast is not that great, a bit plastic! Would go back again."
POSITIVE,"The rooms had a sink in the bathroom and a sink outside the bathroom. They also had a living room area with a sofa,coffee table, and desk. The bed was very comfortable and they had a nice flat screen tv. The location was perfect, you could walk to the shops and many restaurants. We should have brought our swim suits - didn't know that the pool and hot tub would be open in November - they put a tent over it."
POSITIVE,"Unfortunately, we only stayed one night because the Hampton Inn we stayed at in town beforehand was full on the last night we would be in Moab, so the Best Western was our back-up. My sister's comment throughout our stay at Best Western: ""Why didn't you make reservations at this hotel for our entire trip!"" Indeed, I wish I did because the rooms were updated and quite roomy (I commented I could do cartwheels across the room). The two sinks (one outside the toilet/bathtub room and one inside) were convenient, especially for a family of four, and the rooms were very clean (I'm germophobic, so this made me very happy!). The cost was about the same as what we had paid per night at the Hampton Inn, so I think it was on par with the rates in town and a better value compared to the room quality at Hampton Inn. My sister and I also wanted to connect our laptop to the TV screen, but since the hotel's remote controls were a bit different and more simplified than the standard remote (due to their use of ""green remotes"" so that they are easier to disinfect for the next guests), we asked one of the ladies at the front desk to see if they could change the input of the TV so that we would be able to connect our laptop to the TV screen. She was quite knowledgeable (more than we expected since I don't think this is a request they usually receive) and very willing to help to figure out the solution. It didn't take very long, but she was patient throughout the process, and we appreciated the extra effort in providing great customer service. I would love to return to Moab again soon, and when I do, this will be the first place I will look at to book my stay!"
POSITIVE,"We stayed 3 nights in the BW Canyonlands Inn in Moab and really liked it! The best thing about that Best Western Plus Hotel is its location. In the center of Moab right on Center Street and Main Street it is only a short walk from everything, restaurants, bars, shops! The personnel at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. We had a room on the first floor, with a King size bed, a working area and an additional sitting area. Both, room and bathroom were very clean and modern. I also liked the outside breakfast terrace a lot, a nice place for breakfast or in the afternoon, for reading a book and relax. The breakfast room itself has not enough tables in the usual breakfast times but we always managed to find a place. We did not use the pool but it seemed rather small and tight in between the BW and the next building. Booking a long time in advance and for three nights we also had a very reasonable discount on our price."
POSITIVE,"We broke our Jeep and needed to get back home to our dealer in Montana for warranty work. Our problem was a snow storm was headed our way and it was 2:30 pm, well after check out time. Lauri Smith, the Assistant Manager, with a bright smile, sent us on our way without charging us for the night. This was above and and beyond as the room staff had already cleaned our room for the day. Thanks again Lauri! As hotels, motels, and Inns go, this is by far the finest Best Western we have stayed in (anywhere). Even though there are two BW's in Moab with three diamond ratings, (we've stayed in both) the Greenwell doesn't hold a candle to this one--BW should modify their rating system because in this case it is incorrect!"
POSITIVE,We were very please with our stay. The room was clean and roomy. The location was ideal to walk to the local shops and restaurants. It is close to bike trails and national parks. The breakfast was very good as well.

POSITIVE,"This is our second stay at Best Western Canyonlands and we have had a positive experience each time. We stayed for three nights and appreciated the hot breakfast before heading out to the national parks. They rotate the menu so there was some variety. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, wireless internet worked fine. They have chocolate chip cookiesÂ available each evening, which was a nice touch. This is your basic kind of hotel so if you are expecting something upscale, you might be disappointed. Everything met our needs just fine."
NEUTRAL,"Upon check in, we were told repeatedly that we needed to show military I.D. I had mistakenly booked us under a rate that required government I.D. At no time did the woman at check in ask for government I.D., which my husband has but did not have with him. She only requested military I.D., and it wasn't till we got to our room and I rechecked the websiteÂ that we saw it was any government I.D. So watch it on this hotel; her attitude was like we were stupid and she was doing us a huge favor by redoing our reservation, even though they were not very busy. She was helpful, however, when we asked for a room in a quiet area, having spent the two previous nights in noisy hotels; we were hoping to get some sleep! Our room was good sized and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. There is something wrong with the doors to the rooms. Not only do they have a metal threshold, more like an outside entrance than indoor, but when closed, our door had a large gap, and from the hallway never looked completely closed. It didn't ever feel secure. This hotel also has a very odd layout. The breakfast is in a room on the second floor. We stayed on the second floor, yet had to walk up two short flights of steps to get to breakfast. So we wouldn't recommend staying on the second floor if you can't do stairs, because you will have to manage at least four steps to get from the rooms to breakfast. We did appreciate the breakfast. There were two gentlemen there doing the cooking right where you could watch them. Decent amount of choices, and the food was pretty good. The location is right in the middle of Moab. All in all, it was a good place to stay for our trip to Arches National Park."
NEUTRAL,"Stayed 5 nights in October 2011. Generally a good experience. We had a first floor room, and the walls, ceilings are a bit thin, some noise problems, manager did take care of it when it got too crazy. Breakfast was good for the ""freebie"" category, better than some, but not gourmet. It was crowded most mornings. Room was typical for a B.W. Motel, decentÂ flatscreen TV, plenty of room."
POSITIVE,"Was in a great location, close to restaurants, shopping, and the entrance to the park. Service at the main office desk was great, nice clean swimming pool and hot tub. The room was also very clean and comfortable. Had a great time in Utah. Also had a nice breakfast at the motel before we left for site seeing at the national parks in Utah. We were visitingÂ from Wisconsin."
NEUTRAL,"We came to stay for 2 nights to attend a baseball camp in the area. The hotel is under major construction - Thus it is very difficult to know - where to park in order to get into the lobby. When we mentioned it to the hotel staff, they got defensive, and said ""We posted signs"" What they didn't know - is the construction workers had blocks all the signs.Â Once we did check in the staff member that handled us was very good, and seemed to the the manager of the original defensive employee - The rooms are clean and comfortable - and the location is central to everywhere. I wish I had known a head of time that it would be difficult to check in. I wasn't expecting that."

POSITIVE,"Staff could have been a little more friendly but all and all it was good. I would stay there again. The staff wasn't rude or anything, they just didn't expend any extra effort."
POSITIVE,"The reception people were great and answered all my questions. The room was spotless, very quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. Due to an early departure time, I did not get to sample the breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel as a fine option in Moab."
POSITIVE,I thought this was a good hotel but was failing in a few details. My biggest disappointment was not breakfast. All good hotels need a complimentary breakfast in today's marketplace when the bill totals $100 a night. There was also a burn out light bulb in the vanity and the ice machine didn't work in the pool/exercise room.
POSITIVE,"After a horrible experience in a Motel 6 in Ogden, this hotel was totally the opposite. Our room was nice and clean. it had a 40"" HD flat tv and conveniently located. Only bad thing was the wi-fi service was horrible."
POSITIVE,"This BW is conveniently located off the I-95 and withing walking distance of many restaurants or a few min drive to many more. Our room at the back was quiet, clean and fully stocked with amenities. Big soap for the bath (bigger than usual in hotels) and both shampoo and conditioner were appreciated. We were also thankful for a table and two chairs so that we could eat our dinner in the room. Comfortable bed with clean, fresh white sheets and plenty of towels/face cloths. A large park and lovely neighbourhood are right behind the hotel and perfect for walking the dog and stretching your legs. This BW offers and full hot/cold breakfast with a wide variety for any diet. We used the free wifi, microwave, coffee maker and mini fridge. Check in/out fast and friendly. Dog cookie upon departure was gobbled up by the pet. I would stay again & recommend. Room Tip: Dog friendly room at the back was quiet with parking for those rooms away from the main area. More restful for dog and therefore no barking whenever a car door/hotel door opens/closes."
POSITIVE,"When I travel between NC and NY/PA I always stay at this hotel. It's a great location, has a free breakfast, friendly and curteous staff and lots of great restaurants. The photos shown are old. The property has been updated and is clean and new. Room Tip: Anywhere on the property is a good spot. See more room tips"
POSITIVE,"What a pleasant surprise! I recently stayed at this hotel while in town for a gig. Venues normally take care of the accommodation, so I never really get my hopes up that high! This Hotel proves there are Best Westerns and there are BEST WESTERNS! This was a quaint, older looking hotel, but with everything you could ask for. Clean, crisp cotton sheets, clean swimming pool, helpful staff and a pretty decent breakfast buffet included in the price. OK, this ain't no 5 star luxury joint, but if you're in Fredericksburg and looking for somewhere to lay your head on a budget, look no further!"
POSITIVE,"My family (kids and mom) recently spent three nights at the Best Western Regency in Abbotsford, and we really enjoyed our stay. We picked it since we wanted to do some things in Chillwack and also in Vancouver and Abbotsford seemed like a good middle ground. The hotel was clean and conveniently located. It was right next to the highway, but our room was facing away from the highway so was very quiet. Not sure what it would have been like otherwise. They had a good hot breakfast that was included, and the price was really great even though we booked an ""executive"" room, whatever that meant? A/C, TV, fridge, all worked, and the side we were in (there are two parts to the hotel) was clean and seemed updated relative to the other side. Would definitely stay there again in an ""executive room""."
POSITIVE,"This is my third stay at the Best Western Potomac Mills (I was attending a conference) and once again I had a throughly enjoyable time. I was greeted when I got to my room with a ""welcome back"" letter from the manager, along with a jar of chocolates which was a really nice touch and made me feel like I was coming home. The front desk staff were great, especially the two ladies (I'm really sorry I didn't get their names to complement them properly). To me it is the staff that really make or break a stay and being as I am ex hotel staff and am now a travel agent. I'm really picky on customer service as I'm always looking to be able to reccomend a place, and I know what should and shouldn't happen in a hotel. I had a room on level 8 which is one of their ""executive"" floors, so also had a fridge and microwave. The bathroom could have done with a tidy up (the shower head was coming away from the wall and the bath had a crack in it so the water leaked, but there were plenty of towels and the water was hot, so who cares). Apart from that and after two days I lost the wifi reception in my room there were no issues at all (the wifi worked as soon as I walked out the room door, just not in the room so it really wasn't a big deal.). A light bulb had gone in one of the lamps when I first arrived, and by the time I got back from dinner it had been replaced. That to me is awesome service. The hotel itself offers a free breakfast included in the rate which is great, although I did miss the boiled eggs and bananas they used to have. The have also added hot food to the menu with omelets, fried pototos and either bacon or saussages. They also have a coffee machine in the dining area which is accessable all the time, and much nicer than the filter coffee in the rooms :) The location is great for shopping - The Potomac Mills Outlet Mall is just down the road, and it's easy to get into DC as well using the local bus and metro system (for those that don't have a car). All in all I loved my stay and hated to leave. Can't wait to go back, and the Best Western will always be my choice when I'm in Woodbridge."
POSITIVE,"Spent one night at this property for a morning meeting nearby the hotel. Rate is not the cheapest in town (about $90/night with the special rate) but considering wifi, breakfast and parking are all included, the deal is still very good. Hotel is conveniently located on North Fremont St. and very close to freeway so getting in and out of Monterey is super easy yet very quiet otherwise. There are a few shops and restaurants in the immediate area but for more choices, you will need to hit the Cannery Row area which is about 5-7 minutes away by car. Hotels in Cannery Row are generally a lot more expensive and often parking costs extra. For a business traveler like myself, I prefer a convenient yet quiet location so De Anza Inn worked out perfectly for me. Review of this hotel on Tripadvisor is not all that positive so I did not have high expectation while making the reservation. But I was pleasantly surprised after I checked into the hotel and found that not only my room was HUGE, it was also comfortably furnished with a king size bed, a full living room furniture set, a work desk and a huge armoire that houses a microwave/refrigerator/new LCD TV. Bathroom also seemed recently refurbished. The whole room simply looked nice, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is served daily in a small area inside the lobby - very typical continental breakfast but definitely sufficient. Hotel staff had a low key manner yet very professional and helpful. Overall I had a very good experience at De Anza Inn - this place was much better than I originally thought and is perfect for an overnight or short stay - totally suits my need. I will most definitely come back and stay here again. Room Tip: Select a room facing the back so you won't hear any noise See more room tips See all photos"
NEGATIVE,"Don't ever stay at this hotel if roominess, cleanliness, hot water, customer service, breakfast and ammenities are your thing. We arrived from a very late trip last week at 2:30am. Our plan was to stay until around 10am and check out after eating a quick ""complimentary breakfast"" and showering in the morning. None of this happened, and we were treated horribly!!! The check in woman proceeded to help other gentlemen who entered the lobby while we stood there in line. Were we invisible??? The room was the size of a box, if you are claustophobic don't even think about staying here. There were two of us and we were bumping into each other to manuever the room. The bed was hard, and the pillows were terrible. Upon waking up after a very rough few hours of sleep, there was no hot water whatsoever, and when we called to compain the manager was very nonchalant in telling us there was nothing he could do and would not issue us a refund. We then proceeded to try and have the ""complimentary"" continental breakfast, but again a complete nightmare. We got to the breakfast room and it was closed. When we went back to the room and called the front desk we were told it closed at 10am. However our room clock stated it was only 9:10am. The room clock was not set to the right time and we used that thinking that of course they would have their local time correctly set up on their clock. When I asked the manager about that she said, we are only responsible for the time if you call and ask for a wake up call. I don't know about you but I'm 36 years old and have no problem waking up via alarm clock on my own. I don't require wake up calls, and the clock should have the local Puerto Rican time on it, as people are traveling from all over the world. The halls smelled dingy and everything looked weathered and dirty. The cleanest place was actually the tub that ironically we couldn't use!!! I arrived home and called the Best Western and also did an online complaint and Sharon Gomez (the manager) was most unhelpful and very unsympathetic. She seemed to want to battle me instead of do her job and please the customer. If she would have be just a bit amount of aplogetic I might have felt better, but she wasn't. About 5 minutes in, our call was disconnected. I have called her 3 times after and left messages and she has not returned one call. End of story, no refund and no satisfaction. Thankfully we enjoyed the rest of our trip at the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde which was wonderful!!! I would never recommend this hotel to anyone....Beware! Room Tip: Don't stay here!"
