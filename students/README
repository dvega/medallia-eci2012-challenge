MEDALLIA ECI 2012 CHALLENGE
===========================

Thanks for joining the challenge. You are required to create a text classifier
that will label each hotel review in a scale -1 to +1. Negative reviews are
assigned a negative number and positive reviews a positive number.

A sample dataset is provided for testing, along with a framework to run your
code.

You need to implement the class "com.medallia.eci.EciClassifierBuilder".
The template for this class is provided in this package.

The only requirement is to use Java 7, but it is highly recommended to use any
Java IDE (Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, Netbeans, etc) and Apache Maven 2.2

You can write your own code or use any open-source library.

You are required to create a single JAR file. If you depend on external
libraries you must include all required classes and resources into the jar you
will submit to the competition.

If you use Maven and Eclipse, you can create an Eclipse project by doing

      mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse

If you use Intellij IDEA, you can just open the pom.xml file

For building your code, you need to do

      mvn package

The generated JAR file will be created in the "target" directory.

To run your code, see the run.sh file

Take a look also at the "javadoc" directory for more information.

During the competition your code will be tested using a different dataset than
the one provided in this package. You will be given 5000 tagged reviews to
learn from and after that you will be required to classify about 500000
reviews.

Your code will run in a sandbox. You must not access the filesystem or the
network. You have 30 minutes to run, after that time the execution will be
terminated. You have about 100MB of free memory to use.

The trivial classifier that predicts everything as POSITIVE produces a
0.586132 Mean-Square-Error. You are expected at least to improve that mark.

Good luck!
